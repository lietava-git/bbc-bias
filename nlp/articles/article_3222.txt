A vigil held in solidarity with people living in areas of war and conflict around the world has taken place in Oxford. Dozens of people attended the service, which was held in Bonn Square on Sunday night. It happened on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, which saw gunmen storm into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. The event saw residents gather, along with faith and community leaders. It was organised by the Oxfordshire Civic, Community and Faith Leadersâ€™ Group, and  led by the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft and imam Monawar Hussain. Representatives from all faiths were invited to pray and reflect on conflicts around the world, with a focus on those living in Gaza and Israel. The attack on Israel by Hamas marked the beginning of a year of war affecting the Middle East. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has seen at least 41,000 people killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Held in an effort to promote unity, the vigil aimed to stand against "all forms of hatred, racism and division". Mr Hussain said it was "lovely" that so many people had attended the event. "It gives us a chance to stand together for peace, to talk to each other, to create understanding," he said. "And symbolism also, it's really important for people to see how we all come together, different faiths, no faith - but we're together.
