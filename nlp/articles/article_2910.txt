A charity based in West Sussex is providing emergency veterinary care to donkeys in Gaza. Safe Haven for Donkeys was set up in Haywards Heath in 2000 with the aim of helping working donkeys in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The charity is funding a mobile first aid team to treat donkeys and horses needing veterinary intervention amid the Israel-Gaza conflict. Chief executive Andy Foxcroft said donkeys had become the main mode of transport in Gaza for humans. With fuel scarce and many vehicles damaged, donkeys and horses are used to transport people and items like water and medicine. However, the animals suffer from malnourishment, dehydration and wounds, the charity said. Mr Foxcroft said the charity were working tirelessly to help the animals. “Our shipment of food and medicines are desperately needed in Gaza,” he said. “The donkeys will only be able to support their owners and the community if they are fed and cared for. ”Since April, the team has treated approximately 800 donkeys and horses. The doctor leading the team, Dr Saif, said a donkey was used to help transport a pregnant woman to hospital. “There was no way for an ambulance or car to take her from home to the hospital, due to the danger involved, so we had to use a donkey. “She had twins in the hospital, and it was a donkey that saved her and her babies’ lives. ” Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.
