Three people were arrested when a factory in Wirral was targeted by pro-Palestine activists for the second time in three months. The Palestine Action campaign group claimed responsibility for the protest at Teledyne CML Composites in Bromborough, which it claims supplies parts for Israeli warplanes. Merseyside Police said it was called to the site on Tebay Road at 06:05 BST after reports of three people climbing on the roof and causing damage. The force said two people had gained access to the factory via the roof and were detained inside.  The third protester was arrested after being helped down from the roof by Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service.  Palestine Action also claimed responsibility for a similar protest in July when a van was driven through the gates of the factory and red paint was spread around. Ch Insp Chris Barnes said the force respected "the right to protest and expression of views". However, he said: "Any action that involves private property being broken into and damaged will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly.
