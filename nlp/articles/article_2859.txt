Dozens of people have been arrested in Australia's second largest city following a demonstration targeting a military hardware sales show, which protesters said was displaying weapons used by Israeli forces in Gaza. Police said they were "appalled" by the actions of some demonstrators and accused them of pelting officers with rocks, manure and bottles filled with acid. Protesters, meanwhile, accused officers of being heavy-handed - using flashbang grenades and irritant sprays to control the crowds. Authorities said about 1,200 people took part in Wednesday's demonstration, many of whom carried Palestinian flags and sang pro-Palestinian chants. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
