The Coca-Cola float in Saturday’s Brighton Pride parade was unable to complete its journey after protesters blocked the route. Protesters, and Brighton Pavilion MP Sian Berry, say Coca-Cola is an unsuitable sponsor for the city's Pride. Green Party literature posted to Ms Berry’s X account states: "For several years, Coca-Cola has faced calls to remove its factory from illegally occupied land in Palestine, but has refused to do so. "Coca-Cola said it supports the right to peacefully protest and that it decided the float could not continue due to safety concerns over its staff and other attendees. The drink brand’s float was blocked in Marlborough Place during the parade, meaning the procession was rerouted along Grand Parade. On Friday, Pride issued a statement saying it had received “many” requests for its views on international issues. Organisers said they had already committed to reviewing all sponsors ahead of next year’s event. “This will include an assessment of all our relationships with partners who have regularly sponsored Pride, including Coca-Cola,” the statement read. The organisers said a multi-agency review of the parade would be held once Pride weekend was over. A review and debrief is conducted after every Pride weekend. This year's will include the protests.
