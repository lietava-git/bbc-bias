Four signs marking Bournemouth's twin city in Israel that appeared to have been removed by vandals have been replaced. The panels, which stated the seaside town was twinned with Netanya, went missing in April. About £3,200 has now been spent restoring the signs, according to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council, using anti-vandal bolts. It was not known whether the incident was connected to the Israel-Gaza conflict, with police previously trying to identify whether any offences had been committed. Signs on Magna Road, Mountbatten Roundabout, Ringwood Road and New Road were affected. BCP Council previously confirmed that Bournemouth was still twinned with Netanya. A spokesperson from the authority said: “The road signs indicating that the Israeli town of Netanya is twinned with Bournemouth have all been replaced following their disappearance earlier in the year. “The incident was reported to the police, but we are waiting further information on the potential identity of the offenders. ”Dorset Police has been contacted for comment.
