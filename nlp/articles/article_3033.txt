An insurance firm's offices have been sprayed with red paint as part of a national protest by pro-Palestine activists. The Allianz Insurance claims centre in Witan Gate West, Milton Keynes, was one of 10 buildings across the country that were targeted on Tuesday. The Palestine Action group, which is campaigning against the company's alleged links to an Israeli defence firm, has said it carried out the attacks. Allianz Insurance said it had closed the affected premises as a precaution. Photographs of Witan Gate House showed red paint on three of the four floors of the modern glass-fronted building. Doors in the entrance area appear to have been smashed. As well as Allianz Insurance, Witan Gate House also has offices for Milton Keynes University Hospital Trust. The entrance and reception area had been recently refurbished. The campaign group confirmed it had targeted 10 offices of Allianz, "the world's largest insurance firm".Â It said the firm's headquarters were shut while activists "occupied the front overhang" and daubed slogans with red paint. An Allianz spokesperson said: "We have had disruption overnight at several of our offices. "The safety and security of our colleagues is paramount and we have closed these sites today. "They said operations and service to customers and clients were unaffected. A spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said: "At around 06:15 BST this morning. we received reports of an incident of criminal damage on Witan Gate West, Milton Keynes.
