Khan Younis, which is situated in the south of the Gaza Strip, has been the focus of a new Israeli military offensive which it says is aimed at combating “efforts by Hamas to reassemble its forces there"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an evacuation order for eastern parts of Khan Younis on Monday. It also reduced the size of the designated al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, which it claimed was being used by Hamas fighters to carry out  ""terrorist activity and rocket fire"". At least 80 Palestinians have been killed in the area since the Israeli operation began, according to figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. An official from UNRWA - the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees - told the BBC’s Today programme that an estimated 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis since Monday, when the latest evacuation order was announced. ""Over 80% of the Gaza Strip has been placed under evacuation orders or designated as no-go zones by the Israeli military,"" Louise Wateridge said.  WHO 'extremely worried' about possible Gaza polio outbreakIsrael orders evacuation of part of Gaza humanitarian zone On Tuesday, tanks were seen pushing deep into the Bani Suhaila district, with operations also taking place in the area of Al-Qarara. Some residents attempted to flee to displacement camps in the eastern parts of Khan Younis, whilst others crammed into hospitals to seek refuge. Rabah Abdul Ghafour, 37, a resident of Bani Suhaila, took shelter at Nasser Hospital. “I have been displaced 12 times since 7 October,” he told the BBC. “We lived the hardest night of our lives. The sound of explosions and gunfire did not stop for a moment. It was as if the war had started yesterday. ”Rawan Al-Brim, 22, from Al-Qarara, arrived at Nasser Hospital with her husband and mother-in-law on Monday. “We slept in the outer yard without a mattress or a blanket. My four-month-old daughter was born during the war. My breast milk has dried up and I can’t find any milk to satisfy her hunger. My baby screams from hunger all night,” she said. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it also assessed that 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis by monitoring population movements on the ground. It said that many people were “trapped in the evacuation area,” including “people with reduced mobility and family members supporting them. ”“We’re seeing people moving to Deir al-Balah and western Khan Younis. Both of these areas are already extremely overcrowded,” Ms Wateridge told the BBC. “They’ve got limited shelters and limited services available. They can barely accommodate the people who are already in these areas. ”In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating ""in the Khan Younis area over the past 24 hours"" and had “eliminated several terrorists” whilst “dismantling terrorist infrastructure”. Israel’s offensive comes as The World Health Organization said it was “extremely worried” about the possibility of an outbreak of the highly infectious polio virus in Gaza after traces were found in wastewater. Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.","150,000 have fled Gaza's Khan Younis since Monday, UN says","150,000 have fled Gaza's Khan Younis since Monday, UN says",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80ejjdk4r7o,articles/article_1888.txt,results/article_1888.txt.json
2001,2024-07-23 10:02:23.991000+00:00,/news/articles/crgm147lzv1o,"Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah have signed a declaration agreeing to form an interim ""national reconciliation government"" for the occupied West Bank and Gaza after the war with Israel, in a meeting brokered by China, China's foreign minister and Hamas officials have said. Representatives from the groups, along with 12 other Palestinian factions, pledged to work for unity after three days of talks in Beijing. It is the latest of several reconciliation deals Hamas and Fatah have agreed on in their long fractured relationship, none of which have yet led to the end of the schism. Israel has also ruled out a role for Hamas or Fatah in governing Gaza after the end of hostilities there. The deep split began in 2007 when Hamas became the sole ruler in Gaza after violently ejecting Fatah from the territory. This came after Palestinian President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led unity government formed when Hamas won national elections the year before. Since then, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has been left in charge of only parts of the West Bank. Hamas has lost control in Gaza since the war with Israel began on 7 October with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, in which it killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of the Israeli offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. In a statement posted on Telegram, Hamas spokesman Hossam Badran said the declaration was an ""additional positive step on the path to achieving Palestinian national unity"". He said the groups were in agreement on ""Palestinian demands relating to ending the war. . . which are: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, relief and reconstruction. ""He said ""the most important"" part of what was agreed was to form a Palestinian national consensus government ""that would manage the affairs of our people in Gaza and the West Bank, supervise reconstruction, and prepare the conditions for elections"". The declaration is in effect an expression of intent as there are major obstacles to making such an agreement work. Fatah has yet to comment on it, though its representative Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its support of the Palestinian cause following the announcement. Israel, which has vowed to destroy Hamas before it will end the war, swiftly dismissed the Beijing declaration. ""Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X. ""In reality, this won’t happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands. "" But the lack of success of past deals has not deterred China, which wants to broker peace in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and sees Palestinian unity as key to that outcome. Beijing previously hosted talks between Hamas and Fatah in April. ""China and Palestine are trustworthy brothers and good partners,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday, adding that China would ""work tirelessly with all relevant parties"" towards unity and reconciliation. ""Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,"" said foreign minister Wang Yi after the declaration was signed, in remarks reported by Reuters news agency. He also outlined a three-step plan to address the Gaza war: promoting a lasting ceasefire; upholding the ""principle of Palestinians governing Palestine""; and recognising the state of Palestine as part of a two-state solution and giving them full UN membership. China's support of Palestinian causes stretches back to the era of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called ""national liberation"" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. Mr Xi has also sent his top diplomats to the Middle East for talks and recently hosted Arab leaders for a conference in Beijing. The conflict has also erupted at a time when China has ambitions to play a more direct role in international politics and has presented itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Last year it brokered a deal between Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore ties for the first time since 2016. Since then, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US ""hegemonic"" leadership.",China seeks to unite Palestinian factions with reconciliation deal  ,China seeks to unite Palestinian factions with reconciliation deal  ,"palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crgm147lzv1o,articles/article_2001.txt,results/article_2001.txt.json
2123,2024-07-24 00:00:43.622000+00:00,/news/articles/cg3e05n1xy3o,"Ayelet Levy Shachar turned down an invitation to get on Benjamin Netanyahu’s plane to Washington. Her daughter, Naama Levy, was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from an Israeli army observation post near the Gaza border on 7 October. It was not a political decision, she told me, saying she’d been “honoured” to be asked by the Israeli prime minister, but the timing was wrong. Ayelet’s face lights up when she talks about Naama, who turned 20 years old in captivity, describing her as a determined and fun-loving young woman, a good student and athlete. She’s hopeful her nine-month nightmare might be coming to an end. “We have heard from defence and security forces that they're reaching the point of breaking a deal,” she says. “And we have never before been in such a promising point at that sense. ”“Nothing should be distracting [us] at this point. . . this is what we should be dealing with right now. I'm asking and hoping that our prime minister’s commitment to this will be his first priority. ” Some relatives of men and women still held captive in Gaza did travel to Washington with the Israeli prime minister. They were joined by Noa Argamani, the 26-year-old woman who was rescued by Israeli forces in June. It was a controversial decision, as those campaigning for the hostage release deal had been holding protests urging Mr Netanyahu not to go before bringing their loved ones home. When the Israeli prime minister arrived in the US on Monday, he told families of the hostages that an agreement could be nearing, but that military pressure on Hamas must continue. “We see that the enemy's spirit is starting to break,” he said at the first meeting of his visit. “I believe if we are steadfast in this, we can achieve a deal. ”“I am not prepared in any way to give in on the victory over Hamas. ” Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the attack on southern Israel last October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry. Mr Netanyahu has been resisting pressure to accept a proposed ceasefire deal that would allow an exchange of the remaining 116 hostages, 44 of whom are believed to be dead, for Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s security establishment has been signalling that an agreement is possible since Hamas recently dropped its demand for an upfront guarantee of a permanent ceasefire. According to Israeli media reports and BBC sources close to the indirect talks, the negotiations have since bogged down again on Israeli demands that soldiers maintain supervision of corridors along the Egyptian border and in the centre of Gaza, in particular on Mr Netanyahu’s insistence for a mechanism to prevent armed fighters from returning to the northern part of the strip. ""Now is the money time,” Col Lior Lotan, a close adviser to Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, told Israel’s Channel 12 News on Friday. “The terms of the deal includes risks that the defence establishment can tolerate. . . All the heads of the security services say this. To counter them with a hypothetical, as if it were possible to get more through more military pressure, would be wrong. ” Warning: Some readers may find the image below disturbing. This week, Israel confirmed that two more of the hostages had died in captivity several months ago, one of them possibly killed by Israeli military fire - a reminder of the cost of delaying a deal. Ayelet told us that Naama had arrived at the observation post just two days before the Hamas attack on Israel last year, after completing her basic training. “I don’t think she knew where the safe room was,” her mother said. She did find it and sent a message from there, the last her family heard before a video surfaced showing her with tied hands and bloodied sweatpants being forced into the back of a jeep. Last week, the families of the five female soldiers kidnapped from the observation post published photos of them in their early days of captivity, to remind the world about their daughters’ fate. These were screenshots taken from a Hamas video retrieved by the Israeli army during operations in Gaza. One photo shows four of the young women sitting on mattresses, some of them with bandages. Naama is not among them. She is not being held with the others, said Ayelet. There is an image of her with one of her eyes discoloured and swollen shut. Based on information from hostages released during a previous ceasefire and exchange deal in November, Naama’s family understand that her captors moved her from place to place to avoid Israeli military action, and that she had shrapnel injuries in her legs, but was able to walk. They’ve been told by Israeli security forces since then there is “proof of life” without being given details. The latest information they have is that she’s being held in Hamas tunnels. Mr Netanyahu is sending the Israeli negotiating team to Doha on Thursday to continue the talks. The process keeps Ayelet’s hope alive, mixed with desperation as a resolution remains elusive. “Both sides are coming closer with their demands,” she says. “Even saying that it sounds wrong to me, because how can you be talking about demands when you're talking about my daughter's life? We are over nine months so I’m actually feeling desperate. It has to happen. It has to happen. ”Thinking about her daughter helps give her strength to cope with the grinding fear and uncertainty. “I wake up in the morning and she's still there. I count the days, I count the minutes. How can I stop?” she says. “I think she's very strong. And maybe I'm, you know, focusing on that, on that belief that she's very strong and determined, and smart. And she can survive this. ”","Gaza release deal has to happen now, hostage's mother says","Gaza release deal has to happen now, hostage's mother says","israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3e05n1xy3o,articles/article_2123.txt,results/article_2123.txt.json

The message comes after Mr Netanyahu said he would ""present the truth about our just war"", during his first trip outside Israel since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Ahmad Abuznaid, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and a chief organiser, said protesters would ""make the statement that war criminals like Netanyahu are not welcome"" in the United States. Mr Netanyahu was invited by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to give his first address to Congress in nine years. Mr Johnson has warned against protests inside the House chamber, saying there would be arrests ""if we have to do it"". But organisers say the streets will be filled with furious demonstrations. Reem Assil, a member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said she was travelling from California to protest against the the deaths of family members and other civilians in the ""mass slaughter"" in Gaza. ""The idea of the man responsible for these atrocities being allowed to come here, channels my rage,"" she said. ""I've lost over 40 members of my family and work through grief every day to remain committed to showing up for my people. This is a huge moment. ""The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas invaded Israel on 7 October last year, killed approximately 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 Israelis and foreigners. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the Israeli response. Israel denies accusations of war crimes. Mr Netanyahu is also due to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Jinan Deena, a Palestinian-American from the Washington area, said she and others were ""gearing up for a day of rage"" against Mr Netanyahu's visit. ""To know [Mr Netanyahu] is going to be sharing air with us in our own city. . . it's like a slap in the face,"" she said. Another organiser from Michigan, who did not give their name, said ""more people are willing to get arrested this time"" compared to previous protests. More than 300 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested for wrongfully gathering inside and outside of the US Capitol complex in October. An estimated 400,000 gathered in Washington to protest against the war in January. ""All the protests have shown a tone of rage, but this time is definitely different,"" Ayah, an organiser with the Palestinian Youth Movement, told the BBC. ""It is our enemy, our primary enemy, they are inviting into the White House. "" Mr Netanyahu faces both international and domestic pressure for his handling of the war. His US trip also follows a ruling by the International Court of Justice that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories was ""illegal"". Israel rejects the ruling. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in May applied for arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu, as well as senior Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed al-Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, alleging war crimes on both sides. Mr Netanyahu condemned the application as ""a complete distortion of reality"" that equated Israel to the ""mass murderers of Hamas"". Hamas, meanwhile, accused the prosecutor of trying to ""equate the victim with the executioner"". Polling, external by Israel's Channel 12 says that 72% of Israelis think Mr Netanyahu should resign over security lapses on 7 October and the failure to free hostages that still remain in the hands of Hamas. Mr Netanyahu will also face protests in the US from Israelis. Maya Roman, whose cousin spent 54 days in captivity after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, is among those travelling from Israel. She told the BBC that Mr Netanyahu was ""leaving behind"" hostages still in captivity, and ignoring the more pressing issue of a ceasefire deal that would free them. ""By leaving without a signed deal, he makes the hostages and the families feel abandoned,"" she said. Pro-Israel protesters will also be in Washington. Ira Stoll, a Jewish-American who has family in Israel, said he was happy Mr Netanyahu was coming.

Benjamin Netanyahu was invited by the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, whose Republican Party is trying to show unflinching support for Israel. But several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott the address in protest at the huge numbers of Palestinians killed by Israel's offensive. Mr Netanyahu arrived in the US on Monday. After addressing Congress on Wednesday, he will meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, then have a separate meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, about 200 Jewish American peace activists held a protest in the Capitol building complex. Police eventually removed the protesters, who all wore red T-shirts proclaiming ""Not in our name"" and ""Jews say stop arming Israel"". Mr Netanyahu's Washington visit comes as his relationship with the US has grown tense, especially among leading Democrats. President Biden has also grown more critical of Israel as the war continues and the death toll in Gaza climbs. Mr Biden, who dropped out of the presidential election on Sunday, has come under political pressure from his party's left flank to do more to convince Israel to limit its war in Gaza. Vice-President Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, will not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Mr Netanyahu’s address. At least nine senators have announced plans to skip the event, according to the Washington Post, external. Illinois Senator Dick Durban is among them. He said he stood by Israel, but would not stand and cheer its current leader. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, also said he would skip the speech in protest at the ""total war"" waged by Mr Netanyahu's government in the Gaza Strip. ""His policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” Mr Sanders said in a social media post.

2766,2024-07-23 11:34:59.837000+00:00,/news/articles/crgrxjn9rkpo,"The World Health Organization is “extremely worried” about the possibility of an outbreak of the highly infectious polio virus in Gaza after traces were found in wastewater. Dr Ayadil Saparbekov, head of the WHO’s team in the Palestinian territories, told reporters a risk assessment was being implemented and that in the meantime health workers were providing protection advice to Gaza's 2.3 million population. But, he added, it would be “very difficult” for people to follow it, given the breakdown of water and sanitation services. Traces of polio - which is spread through faecal matter - were found in sewage samples collected from two sites in Gaza a month ago, indicating it may be circulating. No associated paralytic cases have been recorded so far. But the Israeli military said on Sunday that it had begun vaccinating its soldiers. The WHO and the UN children's agency (Unicef) believe a mass vaccination campaign may be needed in Gaza. However, the repeated delays for aid workers and humanitarian supplies getting into Gaza, and huge security risks moving around the territory, mean an effective campaign will be very challenging. The Israeli military said it was working with various organisations to deliver vaccines to Palestinians in Gaza. About 300,000 vaccines had been sent to the territory since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas in October, it added. Polio is caused by a virus which spreads easily through contact with the faeces of an infected person, or less commonly through droplets when they cough or sneeze. It can cause paralysis and, in extreme cases, death. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. Polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% in 2022, although it had declined to 89% last year, according to the latest data. But, according to the UN agency, the “decimation” of Gaza health system - with only 16 out of the territory's 36 hospitals partially functional - as well as the ""lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation"" have contributed to reduce immunisation rates and increase the risk of diseases spreading. Dr Saparbekov said many people were living in shelters with just one toilet for 600 people, and had little access to safe drinking water. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry warned last Thursday of a “health catastrophe” in response to the detection of polio in what it said was wastewater flowing ""between displacement camp tents and in inhabited areas"". The WHO has stressed that a ceasefire is essential to allow an effective response. Eight Israeli public health professors made the same appeal in an op-ed published in the Haaretz newspaper on Tuesday, external, warning that those at greatest risk were Palestinian and Israeli infants who have not completed their required vaccinations. “We know what needs to be done. It must be done for the sake of all residents of the region. This is not about politics. This is about health and life,” they wrote.",WHO 'extremely worried' about possible Gaza polio outbreak,WHO 'extremely worried' about possible Gaza polio outbreak,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crgrxjn9rkpo,articles/article_2766.txt,results/article_2766.txt.json

Tanks reportedly advanced into some parts of the city and its surrounding area on Tuesday night, with residents reporting gunfire and heavy shelling. One wounded man who made it to hospital told the BBC “tanks stormed in” to his village without warning. Separately, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck Hamas targets located in four schools sheltering displaced people in central and northern Gaza. The IDF said Hamas members were operating inside ""command and control centres""  embedded inside the Muscat, Rimal, Bureij and Nuseirat Girls schools. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that at least nine civilians were killed at Muscat School, in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, and that six others were killed at the Al-Amal Institute for Orphans, in the Rimal neighbourhood. Later, the Al-Amal Institute for Orphans said in a Facebook post, external that eight people were killed and a large number wounded, including children and women, when an Israeli strike hit one of its buildings housing hundreds of displaced civilians. Gaza's Civil Defence officials also said that three people had been killed and 15 injured when Israel on Wednesday bombed Nuseirat Girls' School in central Gaza, the site of a refugee camp. Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza come one day after it repelled a barrage of missiles from Iran and launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. It has described Tuesday's advance into Lebanon as a “limited” operation, targeting sites belonging to the Lebanese-armed group Hezbollah after a year of cross-border fighting. The IDF is yet to comment on the strikes in southern Gaza, which reportedly occurred at dawn on Wednesday. But one man from Qizan al-Najjar village, south-east of Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic that some of his relatives had been killed in the attack. ""Tanks stormed into the area, accompanied by quadcopters that directly targeted us,"" he said, speaking from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where medical officials also gave updates on the death toll. Another man at the hospital said: ""We were in Qizan al-Najjar when suddenly, shells began to rain down on us from planes and tanks. ""A third man told BBC Arabic: ""There was no prior warning. Following the rocket fire from Lebanon, we witnessed complete destruction. I barely survived; my daughter is injured, and my wife has a head injury that may lead to vision loss. ""He said Israeli forces had also ""completely destroyed"" a house where displaced families had been sheltering. Gaza's health ministry on Wednesday warned the death toll could rise, with another 82 people injured in the strikes. The IDF has launched multiple ground operations targeting Hamas fighters in Khan Younis - Gaza’s second-largest urban area - since December. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.

The strike happened without warning at about 04:00 (02:00 GMT) on Saturday, and was an attempt to assassinate a senior Hezbollah official, Israeli media reported. The attack was heard and felt across the city, and destroyed at least one eight-storey residential building in the densely populated Basta district.

My home now is a battlefield,” said 55-year-old Ali Nassar, who lived in a nearby building. “Even if one person is hiding here…Should you destroy buildings where people are sleeping inside? Is it necessary to kill all the people for one person? Or we’re not humans? That’s what I’m asking. ”According to the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, the attack was an attempt to kill Mohammed Haydar, a top Hezbollah official. Hezbollah MP Amin Sherri said none of the group’s leaders were in the building hit, and Haydar’s fate remained unclear. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not commented. Also on Saturday, the IDF carried out further air strikes on the Dahieh, the area in southern Beirut where Hezbollah is based, saying they were buildings linked to the group. Israeli attacks have also hit the south, where an Israeli ground invasion is advancing, and the east, where air strikes in the city of Baalbek killed at least 15 people, including four children, the Lebanese health ministry said. In the past two weeks, Israel has intensified its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia and political movement, amid international efforts for a ceasefire, in what appears to be a strategy to pressure the group to accept a deal. The escalation comes as renewed negotiations to end more than one year of conflict showed initial signs of progress. This week, Amos Hochstein, who has led the Biden administration’s diplomatic efforts, held talks in Lebanon and Israel to try to advance a US-drafted deal. Since the conflict intensified in late September, Lebanese authorities have said any deal should be limited to the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution includes the withdrawal of Hezbollah’s fighters and weapons in areas between the Blue Line - the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the boundary with Israel. Israel says that was never fully respected, while Lebanon says Israeli violations included military flights over Lebanese territory. The proposal, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, includes a 60-day ceasefire which would see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the removal of Hezbollah’s presence from the area. The Lebanese military would then boost its presence there, with thousands of extra troops. But disagreements over some elements remained, the diplomat added, including about the timeline for an Israeli pull-out and the formation of an international mechanism to monitor the agreement. Both Hezbollah and Iran have indicated being interested in a deal, according to a senior Lebanese source. After the initial shock, the group has reorganised itself, and continues to carry out daily attacks on Israel, though not with the same intensity, and confront invading Israeli soldiers. On Wednesday, Hezbollah’s Secretary General Naim Qassem said the group had received the US proposal, clarified its reservations, and that it was allowing the talks to go ahead to see if they produced any results. The conditions for a deal, he said, were a complete cessation of hostilities and the preservation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, warning that Hezbollah was ready for a long fight. Israel’s stated goal in its war against Hezbollah is to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who have been displaced from communities in northern Israel because of the group’s attacks. In Lebanon, more than 3,670 people have been killed and at least 15,400 injured since October 2023, according to Lebanese authorities, with more than one million forced from their homes.

2825,2024-10-22 17:17:56.970000+00:00,/news/articles/cy898d4px8no,"Mohammed Sukayneh picked his way through slabs of rubble and twisted metal, clutching a few plastic bags - all he could recover from his home of 45 years. It was brought down on top of him and his family last night by an Israeli airstrike, that killed at 18 people, four of them children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The attack happened without warning in a place where people thought they would be safe – about 150 metres from the entrance to Lebanon’s largest public hospital, the Rafik Hariri hospital in southern Beirut. Mohammed and his family were asleep in their beds. “We didn't recognise what is happening,” he said. “After the strike we hear the sound like ‘boom, boom, boom, boom’ like this. And everything is thrown on us.  Stones, metal, steel, fresh blood, fresh meat on us. You couldn't speak, you couldn't breathe, you couldn't take your oxygen. ”He names five neighbours who are still under the rubble of their home. And there were others, killed in an instant, in their own neighbourhood – including two 19-year-old girls who were sitting outside his door. Mohammed, 54, survived with a grazed arm, but his 20-year-old nephew is now in intensive care. “Half of his brain is crushed,” he said. Lebanon says 18 killed in Israeli strike near southern Beirut hospitalBiden 'deeply concerned' about apparent leak of Israel plan to attack IranA civil defence worker at the scene told us six residential buildings had been brought down, most of them three or four stories high. A veiled woman sat on the ground, with her hands on her head, rocking back and forth in distress. “There are no Hezbollah here,” she said, “we are all civilians”. A neighbour said, “everyone flew through the air”. Minutes later more remains were recovered from the rubble and carried away in a black body bag. I asked Mohammed what he thought Israel could have been targeting, in this heavily populated area. “They are hitting everything randomly,” he replied, his voice strengthened by anger. “Without seeing there is children. Where are the guns here? Where are the rockets here? Blind, Israeli enemies. Blind. ” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it struck a ""Hezbollah terrorist target near the hospital” without providing any information about what the target was. It says the hospital itself was not targeted or hit. Rafik Hariri hospital director Jihad Saadeh said it was struck by shrapnel but is functioning normally and will not be evacuated. Not so for the Al Sahel private hospital, about 2km away, which was emptied out last night. “We evacuated instantly, like crazy,” says Dr Mazen Alameh, the general manager.  “We cannot risk anyone's lives. We cannot take it as granted that they (Israel) will not bomb. ”The hurried evacuation of 10 patients and 50 staff came after a public claim by the Israeli military that the hospital was sitting on top of a Hezbollah bunker, full of riches. The IDF gave no proof but produced a 3D animation, claiming to show a bunker beneath the building. “There are hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold inside the bunker, right now,” said the IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. It sounded like an invitation to a heist. At the hospital today management and doctors gathered to deny “Israel’s false allegation” and give us a tour, including the two floors below ground.  The hospital is in the southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, but staff insist strongly that it is not linked with any group. “It's really shocking to say that Sahel Hospital is affiliated with any party in Lebanon,” says Dr Alameh. “It's a private hospital. It's a teaching hospital for doctors, physicians and other medical students. ""He dismissed Israel’s claim of a hidden bunker. “The hospital was founded 40 years ago on an old house,” he said.  “It’s impossible to have any tunnel or infrastructure underneath. Any person in the world can come here and see everything they want. ”We were encouraged to check in every corner. Nowhere was off limits, not even the morgue.  Bundles of surgical scrubs, and packets of surgical instruments were opened to show there was nothing concealed. After the tour, we were allowed to move around freely. We saw empty wards and anxious staff, but no hint of a bunker. Israel claimed the entrance was in a neighbouring building. We went there too and had free access to the parking lot underneath. If there was an entrance to a secret bunker, we did not find it. The only door we saw led to a lift, which we could not open. But that door was not concealed, and seemed an unlikely access point to a hidden chamber full of gold. As we left the hospital as an Israeli drone circled overhead in the sunshine.  Israel says its air force is “monitoring the compound but it will not strike the hospital itself. ”For now, Al Sahel remains closed, but doctors want to get back to treating the sick. “We are an institution helping people,” said Dr Walid Alameh, the medical director, and a cousin of Dr Mazen.  “The founder of this hospital is my father,” he said, becoming emotional. “This is my home. Hopefully tomorrow we will open. ""But Israel is imposing its own wartime schedule here. This afternoon it bombed Beirut again, a short drive from the hospital, and on Hezbollah’s doorstep. A spokesman for the armed group had called a rare press conference. As it was underway, the IDF issued a warning, telling residents of two nearby buildings to leave as they were “located near Hezbollah facilities. ”Half an hour later two more multi story buildings vanished from the skyline in seconds, reduced to dark clouds of smoke and ash. In homes, and in hospitals here, many are stricken by fear.

2826,2024-10-07 09:01:52.515000+00:00,/news/articles/czrm4yxpr3xo,"A group of Jewish and Muslim women came together on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the 7 October attacks and to help “stop the hate on [Britain’s] streets”. Six Muslim and six Jewish women met at St John’s Church in Waterloo in central London to talk about the impact the conflict in the Middle East is having on communities in the UK. In what was described as a safe space by organisers, the group shared their feelings of “exhaustion, pain and suffering”. They were also keen to express their “hope and gratitude” which they felt had come from similar acts of unity. Organisers Julie Siddiqi, a Muslim, and Laura Marks, who is Jewish, are co-founders of the Nisa-Nashim Jewish and Muslim Women’s Network. They said the meeting was a symbol of cross-faith unity against hatred and “not being made to feel we have to pick sides”. Ms Marks said: “One year on and here we are: The world feels a worse place. ""Our responsibility is to ensure we do everything to stop the hate on our streets, to make them feel safe for our children, for our grandchildren, so that the world can actually become a safer place for them to be. ""That can only be done if you do it together. "" Members were asked to share their feelings and thoughts on what is happening in the Middle East, and how the war had affected them and their communities. Ms Siddiqi said: “We heard it all today. None of it surprised me. People were talking about literally being exhausted. It’s been a very heavy year. “We need to not allow extreme voices to be the only voices, the loud voices that often try to divide more than connect. “None of us are saying that we have to agree on everything, but it’s so important for us to stand against hatred together and not be made to feel that we have to pick sides, or we have to only sit in this box or this box. ” The gathering came after tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through London on Saturday. The Metropolitan Police said it made at least 17 arrests - on suspicion of a number of offences including supporting a proscribed organisation, public order breaches, and assault.

2828,2024-12-07 02:23:47.315000+00:00,/news/articles/cdd64v77491o,"Wedged into the middle of a three storey-high pile of rubble and charred possessions in southern Beirut is a twisted and cracked metal sign. “Spare parts. Jeep Cherokee,” it says. It is the only indication that the ground floor of this destroyed building had been occupied by a busy car parts dealership – one of many such businesses destroyed by Israel’s heavy bombing of Dahieh, the largely Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb  of the capital. “We were so confident we wouldn’t be hit, because of the nature of the people here – ordinary, people, business owners,” said Imad Abdelhak, staring up at the smashed building. Abdelhak’s garage, next door, had survived the worst of the air strike, but he was waiting to find out if the whole structure would have to be torn down because of the impact. All over Lebanon, business owners are reeling after an intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah saw Israeli bombs rain down on residential, commercial and industrial parts of the country, destroying shops, warehouses and stocks of goods. A US- and French-brokered ceasefire, which is largely holding, halted the war last week, but for many of the country’s business owners and workers the pain is only beginning. “I have lost $20,000 and my only source of income,” said Ibrahim Mortada, another car parts dealer in Dahieh whose building was hit. “I have no idea how we can survive,” he said. Like Abdelhak, Mortada was waiting for engineers to assess the building, but it was clear to anyone standing underneath it that the structure was unsafe. The top seven floors had been destroyed by a direct strike. Huge slabs of concrete and loose rubble hung precariously over Mortada’s head as he attempted to clear up what was left of his premises. “My business has been open here for 23 years,” he said, dejectedly. “We are counting on God to help us now. ”The business owners of Dahieh and beyond are also counting on Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese political and militant group, which said it will begin this week to assess the damage to homes and businesses and dole out cash for people to pay rent, buy new furniture, and begin to rebuild. In the southern city of Nabatieh on Wednesday, where its Ottoman-era market and surrounding businesses were completely destroyed, people were still waiting for the Hezbollah assessors to arrive. “Nobody has contacted us – nobody from the government, nobody from any group,” said Niran Ali, a 56-year-old woman whose shop, Zen Baby Fashion, had disappeared with virtually all of its stock. Scanning the rubble, Ali caught sight of a pink, soot-covered pair of girls’ tracksuit bottoms, hanging from a steel girder jutting out of the heap. “These were mine,” she said, running her finger across the blackened fabric. “Maybe they are the only thing left of my business. ” Like others in Nabatieh, Ali had heard that Hezbollah was going to begin by assessing homes (the group has pledged $5,000 per household to help pay for rent, and $8,000 to replace furniture) and then move on to businesses, where the losses are much higher. Jalal Nasser, who owned a large complex containing a coffee shop, restaurant and library, returned to the city on the first day of the ceasefire to find the complex transformed into a charred husk by a massive air strike across the road. He estimated he had lost up to $250,000. He set up a small table and chair on the edge of the shell of the building, overlooking the main street, and smoked his shisha. “To give people hope”, he said. As for where the money was going to come from to rebuild, “that is the big question,” he said, shrugging. “But we are waiting for Hezbollah. I’m sure they will give. ”The World Bank estimates this war has caused at least $8.5bn worth of damage to Lebanon’s economy. It would be a huge sum for any similar nation, but for Lebanon it comes on the heels of a financial crisis in 2019 and the devastating port blast the following year. In the aftermath of the previous war with Israel, in 2006, money poured in from Iran and from gulf states to rebuild Lebanon. This time around, it is unclear if that tap will turn on. “There is nothing yet in terms of allocation for reconstruction,” Nasser Yasin, the environment minister and head of the government’s crisis cell told the BBC on Wednesday. “We have some good indications, some pledges from friends of Lebanon,” he said. “But we estimate we are going to need billions of dollars this time. The level of destruction is probably six to 10 times what it was in 2006. ”Israel has said it was acting solely against Hezbollah in its strikes on Nabatieh, and not against the Lebanese population. Yasin accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of ""urbicide"" for its widespread destruction of the city. On a visit to Nabatieh on Wednesday afternoon, Imran Riza, the UN’s deputy special co-ordinator for Lebanon, told the BBC the scale of what needed to be done was “enormous”. “The past two and a half months, particularly, have been massively destructive,” he said. “It is a very long road back. ” The historic market in Nabatieh dates back about 500 years. It has repeatedly come under attack from Israel in the decades since 1978. Unlike previous attacks, this time the destruction was total. “This is the worst for Nabatieh, the worst war we have seen,” said Yusuf Mouzzain, who owned a clothes shop in the market. In his shop, a few surviving clothes hung on a rail, coated in soot. He estimated he had suffered about $80,000 worth of damage. In 2006, Hezbollah gave a good sum to the affected business owners. This time, he had no idea what they would receive, or who from. “But we have lost everything, he said. “So someone has to give us something. ”Additional reporting by Joanna Mazjob.

2829,2024-10-04 14:47:01.862000+00:00,/news/articles/cvglk3d3242o,"In the early hours of Thursday morning, a missile tore through a building in the heart of Beirut, far from where Hezbollah’s presence is strongest in the south. Unlike for many of the other strikes targeting Hezbollah in recent days in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the IDF did not issue an evacuation order in advance. Five members of staff and two volunteer paramedics at a health facility located in the same building were killed, according to the Hezbollah-linked civil defence agency - an emergency response organisation. Nine died in total, according to Lebanese authorities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike ""targeted terror assets of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation"". BBC News teams went to the scene and tried to piece together what happened. ""I felt that my heart was going to stop - it was pounding very, very loud,” one witness told the BBC. The sound of the missile hitting the 12-storey building was heard across the Lebanese capital and smoke was still drifting into the air the following morning. The building which was targeted is in Bachoura, a largely residential part of the city, and a matter of metres from the Lebanese parliament building. It is more than 4km (2.5 miles) from Dahieh, where Hezbollah has a strong presence and which has been the focus of Israeli strikes in recent weeks - including the one which killed the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah last week. The IDF has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon in the past one and a half weeks in an effort to dismantle Hezbollah’s leadership and ability to launch rockets, missiles and drones into Israel – something the Iran-backed group has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the Gaza war. Tens of thousands have died in fighting since, mainly Palestinians in Gaza, and dozens of strikes have targeted Beirut in recent days. And in Lebanon more than 2,000 people have died, according to the health ministry. On the second floor of the Bachoura high-rise block, below several apartments, was a medical facility run by the Islamic Health Committee (IHC), which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The group has a very extensive network of services that spans into supermarkets and schools. It provides medical care to people living in areas with a strong Hezbollah presence, who rely on its centres for treatment, medication and paramedics. The missile hit one of these centres shortly after midnight. Witnesses said the area was busy at the time and as the sound of the explosion rang out, children began to scream. Efforts to clear the rubble were still ongoing when BBC teams arrived at the scene on Thursday morning. Medical equipment like gloves and masks were visible in the wreckage. Hassan Ammar, 82, told the BBC he had been living in the building which was struck for 24 years with his wife and two daughters. He characterised the health service housed in his building as “helping all the Lebanese” and “just like the Red Cross, but an Islamic one"". “When we heard the strike, I ran out of the building with my wife and daughters, our apartment was severely damaged,” he said. “This is a civilian facility - why would they target a civilian facility?”The IDF has not commented on the Bachoura strike but has repeatedly said it does not target civilian infrastructure. The following morning, Amin Sherri - a Hezbollah MP - arrived at the scene thronged by journalists. In 2019, he was designated a financer of terrorism by the US Treasury, which accused him of threatening Lebanese bank officials and their families after it froze the accounts of a Hezbollah member. The US also accused him of having “extensive ties” to Hezbollah financiers, and it released a picture purporting to show Sherri alongside the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ overseas operation arm before he was killed in a US strike in Iraq in 2020. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union. On Thursday morning, Sherri held an impromptu news conference at the site of the strike and accused the IDF of deliberately attacking the medical facility. He said: “We will continue this resistance and confrontation, and we will not abandon our responsibilities. ”Throughout the morning, there was chaos outside the devastated Bachoura medical centre - and a palpable sense of anger. “As soon as we heard the air raid, we came out of the building running, children were screaming, sometimes you feel your heart is going to stop,” one man said. He insisted the medical centre served many locals and did not have a political or military function. BBC News was unable to get access to the interior of the deserted building. People who lived above the centre said they did not know where they would go tonight. Kamal, a paramedic at the centre, said staffing had recently been increased in light of the fighting. “This is why most of the casualties were medics,” he said. Some of those killed were sleeping when the missile hit, he said. The strike in Bachoura was condemned by the European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who said the IDF had “targeted once again healthcare workers”. He said the strike had killed civilians in a densely populated area, and denied others access to emergency care, before characterising it as a violation of international humanitarian law. On Thursday, the World Health Organization said 28 healthcare workers were killed in the 24 hours previous in Lebanon, and many more “are not reporting to duty” because they had been forced to flee. Israel says it is necessary to take on Hezbollah in order for people in the north of the country to be able to return to their homes.

2830,2024-09-30 10:53:13.562000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2591w37q9o,"Israel's continuing air strikes may have forced as many as one million people from their homes across Lebanon, the country's prime minister, Najib Mikati, has said. Lebanon's health ministry reported 105 people killed in Sunday's strikes - two days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel. Lebanese families displaced by the air strikes have told the BBC of their fear and anxiety over what is to come. We visited one school in a southern Beirut suburb housing around 2,000 people who have fled their homes. Many of them were having to sleep in the courtyard because they could not find space indoors.  Grandmother Um Ahmad says a building just next to their home in southern Lebanon was badly hit by an Israeli air strike. She and her family survived “magically”, she says. “I just grabbed my grandchildren and ran. A part of our house was in flames. ""They jumped into their car and drove off while more buildings were being bombed in their street. They looked back to see their house was also levelled to the ground. “At least we know for sure that we don’t have a home to go back to,” Um Ahmed says while trying not to break into tears. “I don’t want to cry. There is nothing to cry about any more. We lost everything, but thanks to God, we survived. ”They fled to Beirut from a tiny village near the city of Tyre. Their refuge is a classroom that is now a shelter for hundreds of people. Laundry is draped around the room, hanging off the whiteboard, walls and windows. Um Ahmed’s two grandsons have disabilities and mental health issues. She sounds frustrated and angry: ""I’m sad for Gaza’s children, but what is our children’s fault?”We hear a loud bang as emergency teams offload some supplies outside in the corridor. Her younger grandson starts crying.

With every loud sound, every door slamming, he starts crying and screaming. ”She says her grandchildren can’t sleep at night any more, so she and her husband cannot either. “All the children here are reacting to any loud sound. They think it’s an air strike. ”Um's husband Barakat joins us. He blames the politicians without mentioning Hezbollah.  “I know we needed to support the people of Gaza, but that wasn’t our war. We of course want to protect our land, but for us, for the Lebanese, we should fight for ourselves. ”Like many other families here, they have been displaced before. They lost their homes in 1982 and 2006 too. This is now the third time. Barakat says he and his family are exhausted and don’t want war. ""We don’t wish for Israeli children to die, nor for our own children to die. We should live in peace. ” I ask him if he thinks that is possible. “I don’t think so. Netanyahu doesn’t want peace. It is now very clear and this war is going to be much harder than 2006 [when Israel and Hezbollah went to war], for sure. ”“Just as we cry for children in Gaza, we cry for our own children too. Just as the Israelis cry and are afraid for their children, so do we,” says Um. Other families recall being warned by the Israeli military of impending attacks. “We only had short notice. We received a message that was sent by the Israeli army to our phones, asking us to leave our house,” says 65-year-old Kamal Mouhsen. “I just grabbed my car key and left with my family. ”He was one of many people who received the same message at about noon on Saturday. He says there was a series of air strikes on their neighbourhood soon afterwards. He is wearing a T-shirt and shorts. “All we have now is what you see we are wearing. ”He is sitting with his daughter, grandson and two of his neighbours in the courtyard of the school where they took refuge. “We are now among 16 people living in one room,” says Nada, Kamal’s daughter. “In the 2006 war, we also came here. ""Nada believes this war will be more difficult. “They [the Israelis] killed the leader of Hezbollah. This itself shows that this time is different. ” For others, leaving the country through war-torn Syria seemed like a better option than hoping to survive Israeli air strikes. Sara Tohmaz, a 34-year-old Lebanese journalist, fled her house in Beirut’s southern suburbs with her mother and two siblings the Friday before last. She told BBC News Arabic she feels relief that they took the decision to leave the country before Israel assassinated Hezbollah's leader. The family took almost 10 hours to reach Jordan through Syria by car. “We are lucky enough to have a place to stay in Jordan, where my mother’s relatives are based,"" she says. ""We don’t know what will happen next, and don’t know when we will be back.

2831,2024-10-17 05:10:49.164000+00:00,/news/articles/c0lwpg9xrxdo,"Walking through the ruins of what used to be his home, 29-year-old Ahmad Musa al-Qumbar always feared the Jerusalem city authorities would come after him. The married Palestinian father-of-four built the modest single-storey building seven years ago, on land he owns and where his family have lived for generations. But Ahmad never actually had a legal permit to build. He lives in the Jabal Mukaber district of East Jerusalem. Within sight of the Old City and its many historic religious monuments, it is one of the most densely populated and fiercely contested parts of the region. It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and later annexed, but is widely regarded internationally as Palestinian territory. Control of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues of the decades-old conflict. Palestinians officially claim East Jerusalem as their capital, while Israel considers the whole of the city as its capital. “Who” is allowed to build “where” in the city is a big part of that battle. The rate at which Palestinian homes are being demolished in occupied East Jerusalem has almost doubled since the start of the conflict in Gaza, say human rights groups and monitoring organisations. The demolitions are ordered by the Israeli-run municipal authority which says that many buildings, like Ahmad’s, are illegally built without permission. One NGO, Ir Amim, says that “under the cover of war”, Israel is “forcibly displacing Palestinians from their homes and the city”. “I had to demolish my house after I was hit with penalties by the police and the Israeli courts,” Ahmad tells me as he stands in the rubble of what used to be his kitchen. “I couldn’t pay the fines and risk losing things like healthcare and my child insurance. Of course, we appealed to the court, but they refused. ”Like many in the same situation, Ahmad reluctantly hired heavy machinery to knock down the house himself. He said that the Jerusalem City authorities would have charged him the equivalent of $100,000 (£75,600) if they’d carried out the order. It made the job perhaps even more painful - tearing down his family’s labours and his children’s future with his own hands. Almost all attempts by Palestinian families in East Jerusalem to apply for planning permission are rejected by the Israeli authorities. That means growing families say they have no choice but to build illegally and face the potential consequences – huge fines and demolition orders. Some say the law and the courts are being deliberately used to suppress Palestinian growth and ambitions. “These Palestinian communities ask for permission, and between 95% to 99% of the requests are denied,” says Shay Parnes, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem. “It has been happening for years,” continues Parnes. “Sometimes they use security reasons to justify it, but it’s always under the same framework of expelling Palestinians. . . because the law is different for different communities who live side by side in the same city. ” On the predominantly Jewish Western side of the city, what used to be a skyline of relatively low, white-stone buildings has changed dramatically in recent years. Construction is booming. Cranes operate virtually 24/7 with new high-rise buildings, both residential and commercial, growing tall as that side of Jerusalem expands. There’s been frenetic construction, too, in some areas of East Jerusalem where land has been claimed by Israel to make way for Jewish settlements. In Har Homa, an estimated 25,000 people now live in brand new homes on land formally expropriated by Israel in 1991. Just across the road are the Palestinian villages of Umm Tuba and Sur Baher, where many public facilities are notably inferior to those in Har Homa. In stark contrast to the building work on the other side of the highway, several homes have been forcibly demolished here in recent years in what Amnesty International describes as “a flagrant violation of international law and part of a systematic pattern by the Israeli authorities to forcibly displace Palestinians”. It's a similar picture in the settlement of Gilo, expanding rapidly in what is internationally regarded as occupied East Jerusalem, while, it’s argued, neighbouring Palestinian suburbs are denied the ability to grow at anything like the same rate. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Israel also denies that demolitions are part of deliberate policy of discrimination that has gathered pace under the cover of the distraction of the Gaza war. In a statement, the Jerusalem Municipality said the accusations were “absolutely false” and that it had local support for “comprehensive building and construction plans across nearly all areas of East Jerusalem”. The plans “aim to provide options for neighbourhood expansion, address the widespread issue of illegal construction, and designate areas for the construction of municipal service structures,” it added. But it isn’t hard to find examples where Israeli demolition orders against Palestinian homes are being enforced across East Jerusalem. In the suburb of Silwan, just below the Old City, we found another Palestinian home in ruins. Lutfiyah al-Wahidi says the annexe had been built for her son’s family more than a decade ago but eventually the authorities came calling. “Even if we build just one brick, the authorities come and demolish it. How did our house harm them? It’s on land that I doubt the authorities will ever be interested in. ” The grandmother says she has paid thousands of dollars in court fines over the years in a vain attempt to keep the property. “My son has a family of six with only one provider. What harm are they doing, yet they still want to demolish it,” she says, her wider family now dispersed to other parts of the city. In a comprehensive policy brief, Ir Amim found that since the outbreak of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, “there has been a major acceleration in the promotion and fast-tracking of new settlement plans in East Jerusalem and a dramatic spike in the rate of demolitions of Palestinian homes"". ""The Israeli government is clearly exploiting the war to create more facts on the ground,” it continues. There are estimated to be at least 20,000 outstanding demolition orders in East Jerusalem – orders which have no expiry limit. Many commentators have also observed that since 7 October, far-right members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and in the Jerusalem Municipality have become more confident in publicly expressing their intent to see more Jewish homes built on occupied or contested land. While Palestinians, like Ahmad’s and Lutfiyah’s families, become noticeably more afraid of losing their homes, they insist they will stay and eventually rebuild their lives here in East Jerusalem.",'I had to bulldoze my house' - Palestinians face spike in Israeli demolition orders in East Jerusalem,'I had to bulldoze my house' - Palestinians face spike in Israeli demolition orders in East Jerusalem,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lwpg9xrxdo,articles/article_2831.txt,results/article_2831.txt.json
2832,2024-12-03 19:22:08.444000+00:00,/news/articles/cq5le4w5454o,"The mother of the only British-Israeli hostage being held by Hamas has described her increasing fears for her daughter's life after more than 400 days in captivity. Emily Damari, 28, was taken by Hamas from her home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. “I fear that she's dead,"" her mother Mandy told the BBC in her first television interview. ""And if she's not dead, she's not getting enough food to eat, she's not able to wash herself, drink water, she could be ill. ""“She's suffering from gunshot wounds to her hand and her leg. . . I worry every day, I worry every second because in the next second, she could be murdered, just because she's there. ”Mandy Damari, who was born in Surrey, called on the British government to do more to ensure humanitarian supplies go to the hostages while negotiations continue for their release. She also welcomed US President-elect Donald Trump’s statement that there would be “hell to pay” if the hostages were not released before he takes office in January, saying: “It made me a bit more optimistic”. Hamas gunmen shot Emily and killed her dog when they attacked Kibbutz Kfar Aza almost 14 months ago. Mandy also hid as Hamas stormed her home and was only saved when one of the bullets jammed the lock of the room she was hiding in. About 1,200 people were killed that day, while Emily and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent months working on a deal to secure the release of the 97 remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire in Gaza. But the negotiations have stalled, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for the impasse. Without directly mentioning Hamas or Gaza, Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday: “Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire world, in the Middle East - but it’s all talk, and no action!""""If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity,” he warned. Mrs Damari said the post “gave me a bit of hope that maybe someone does really care about what's going on there”. “Someone has to do something and take strong action to get them released. And that's the strongest thing I've heard anyone say for a long time. ”She said she hoped Trump would do everything in his power to get her daughter and the other hostages released. Mrs Damari - who describes her daughter as a Spurs football fan who loves coming to the UK to visit family, go shopping and visit pubs - is disappointed with the British government. She is currently in the UK meeting political leaders, including the prime minister. But she described the government’s recent decision to back a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as not doing enough to ensure the release of the hostages. The draft did demand their release, but it was vetoed by the US, which said it did not make that a precondition for a ceasefire. “I felt really like they were stabbing me in the heart. There was no prerequisite to release the hostages. . . It was basically signing a death warrant for her [Emily], because if there's a ceasefire with no release of the hostages, the hostages will stay there forever,” Mrs Damari said. She now wants them to do more. “I really need the British government if they are not able to get her released immediately, at least to get her humanitarian aid or a sign of life, and let me know what's happening with that, because I'm desperate for a sign of life. ”She added: “We talk about humanitarian aid all the time to Gaza, but I don't hear about humanitarian aid for the hostages who are held in despicable conditions. I'm desperate to get humanitarian aid into her, for someone to see her. It's a human right to allow to allow people to see what's happening to her. ”Mrs Damari initially did not speak out publicly about her daughter because she trusted the governments and negotiators to get her released. But now she wants the British public to understand a dual citizen is being held. “She is the only British hostage being held. . . and I want people to help me to get her out, to be her voice because she can’t call out for herself. She has no voice. ”More than 44,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",'I worry every second': Mother of only British hostage in Gaza fears for her life,'I worry every second': Mother of only British hostage in Gaza fears for her life,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5le4w5454o,articles/article_2832.txt,results/article_2832.txt.json
2833,2024-10-07 09:28:32.517000+00:00,/news/articles/cy89v4g5285o,"For the past year London’s Palestinian and Israeli communities have been living with the fallout of a conflict thousands of miles away yet all too close to home. On 7 October 2023 Hamas operatives from Gaza invaded Israel, killing more than 1,000 Israelis and taking around 250 hostage. Israel has responded by bombing Gaza, leaving at least 41,000 Palestinians dead. As conflict escalates across the Middle East, I met two Londoners - one Israeli and one Palestinian -  who shared with me their grief and trauma and thoughts for the future, one year on. Magen Inon, 41, a lecturer lives in London with his family. His parents were killed on 7 October at their home in a smallholding in Israel, close to the border with Gaza. ""My parents sent a message saying they can hear gunshots, that they are in the safe room. That was the last message we got from them. "" His parents' home was burned down. His father's death was confirmed soon after but not his mother's. ""We didn't have confirmation that my mum died until August. It took months. ""My mum was supposedly the last missing person from October the 7th.  Since then he has dedicated his time trying to continue what he believes was his parents' legacy: to stop the war, call for the return of the hostages and call for humanitarian aid to go into Gaza. ""My parents, they raised us in a house that was always open to everyone. It didn't matter their group identity, their religion, their mother tongue. . . it was natural for us. "" But in the immediate aftermath of 7 October he and his four siblings felt some people were ""trying to hijack our pain in order to call for revenge and call for continuous violence"". ""It was very important for us to raise a different voice. ""He has been holding talks at universities with like-minded Palestinian counterparts where possible, calling for a ceasefire, an end to the war and to send humanitarian aid to Gaza.  Journalist Ahmed Alnaouq, 30, grew up in Gaza but came to the UK as a student five years ago. He also lives in London, with his wife. He lost 21 close family members on 22 October when his family home was bombed. ""Israel dropped a bomb on my house, killing my father, my two brothers, my three sisters, my 14 nieces and nephews, and my cousin. ""They were in Deir Al Balah in the south of the Gaza strip. It was designated a 'safe area' at the time by the Israelis. ""Since then, he says, he has lost more relatives. ""I have lost so many family members. I am sincerely and genuinely telling you that I don't know how many family members I lost. "" Ahmed runs We are Not Numbers, a youth-led Palestinian non-profit project which tells the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news. He is also co-founder of Across The Wall with Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, a writing project started in the Gaza Strip in Hebrew and Arabic which, before this conflict, aimed to help Israelis understand the human stories behind what is happening behind the wall which separates Gaza and Israel. He still very much believes in peace, but adds ""right now it seems very dark, very bleak"". ""The only hope I have, the only light at the end of the tunnel I can see, is the good people from all over the world who still care about the Palestinians. "" Both of their lives have changed irrevocably since this time last year. ""The problem is that it is not ending. It is ongoing. It is continuous and we don't know when it will end or if it will end,"" said Ahmed. ""We have been living a series of horrors and trauma that I believe we will never heal from. Never. ""I think the trauma we are living right now we will pass it to our children and grandchildren. "" Magen says he often feels anxious when meeting Palestinians, but he knows that despite the divide, ""we're suffering from the same conflict"". He said: ""If you share the same values, you can move past that and actually become partners and I've had that experience a few times over the last year with quite a few Palestinian partners I'm working with. He would like to continue to be a peacemaker. ""Once you start thinking about 'what's the world I want to create for my kids?  what's the future I want them to have?' rather than 'how do I avenge my loved ones' death?' which I think takes us in the wrong direction. ""It's much easier to find common ground. "" Despite the  trauma of losing so many family members , Ahmed says the past cannot be changed. Instead he believes it is more important to focus on the future. ""We are all brothers and sisters, in humanity. What's happening in Gaza is a war against humanity. ""All of us should work together to end this. . . but also all wars everywhere.

2834,2024-09-28 20:03:56.041000+00:00,/news/articles/c20jpyzgq8qo,"Lebanon is a country that knows war all too well. And it is not eager for more. It still bears the scars of 15 years of civil war between 1975 and 1990, and of the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. But for some, including Beirut's Governor Marwan Abboud, Israel’s recent escalation already feels worse. In the past 10 days, the country has endured mass casualties from exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, a wave of assassinations of Hezbollah military commanders, devastating air strikes - and the use of bunker-busting bombs in Beirut, which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. ""It’s the worst moment that the country passed through,"" said Abboud, who has no connection with Hezbollah.   ""I feel sad. I am shocked by the large number of civilian casualties. I am also shocked by the silence of the international community - as if what’s happening here does not mean anything. ""US and allies call for 21-day ceasefire in LebanonWhat might Hezbollah, Israel and Iran do next?Follow live: Nasrallah's killing is 'historic turning point', Netanyahu saysWe spoke at the edge of Beirut’s Martyrs Square, where many families slept in the open last night after fleeing Israel’s strikes in the southern suburb of Dahieh -  Hezbollah's heartland. They remain in the square today - unsure where to turn for safety, like many in Lebanon. Asked what he thought Israel’s plan was, the governor replied: ""I don't know but Israel wants to kill and to kill and to kill. May god protect this country. ""His parting words were bleak. ""It’s the saddest day of my life,"" he said, his voice heavy with emotion. A few steps away we met an extended family, sitting on bare concrete, under the harsh morning sun. Madina Mustafa Ali was rocking her seven-month-old baby Amir in her lap and reliving the trauma of Friday night. ""There was an explosion, and we got scared, especially for the children. So we ran away and came here. This is where we slept,"" she said. She told me the family will stay in the square for now because they have nowhere else to go. Others are fleeing, some heading to the north of Lebanon. The south of the country is not an option - it's being hit hard. Driving through the city we saw families on the move, some crammed into cars with thin mattresses strapped to the roof, others piled onto motorbikes.  Here and there, we saw people on foot carrying a few belongings. This is the new landscape of Beirut: boarded-up shops, fewer people, and more fear - especially since Nasrallah’s killing was confirmed. Throughout the day, plumes of dark smoke billowed from Dahieh. The Hezbollah stronghold looked much weakened today - the two busiest streets were largely deserted, and many apartment blocks looked empty.  We spotted Hezbollah members, guarding an air strike location, one brandishing a Kalashnikov. That's a sign of tension, or desperation - as normally the armed group doesn't show its weapons on the streets. Hezbollah was not watching our every move today - they were more focused perhaps on the threat from above. We, too, were keeping an eye on the skies, where there were drones. At the location of one Israeli strike, we saw smoke still rising from the ruins of what appeared to be a factory. We were told it made kitchen roll, and there was plenty of that shredded on the ground. Lebanon has been rendered a war zone, but there are risks growing for the entire Middle East. And plenty of questions. Will Hezbollah hit back hard at Israel? Can it?Will its Iranian backers intervene? Until now they have been in no rush. And will Tehran's other regional proxies - in Iraq, Syria and Yemen - get more involved?Three days of national mourning are due to begin in Lebanon on Monday. No-one can be sure what else is ahead.",'It's the worst moment the country has passed through','It's the worst moment the country has passed through',israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20jpyzgq8qo,articles/article_2834.txt,results/article_2834.txt.json
2835,2024-11-14 06:12:21.426000+00:00,/news/articles/cgmvxgkwg17o,"In August, Clare Rogers' daughter was arrested after allegedly taking part in direct action at an Israeli defence firm near Bristol. ""I discovered, three days in, still no phone call, that she was held under the Terrorist Act. And that meant seven days in solitary, and no right to a phone call. . . It was shocking,"" she said. Zoe Rogers, 21, is one of a group of pro-Palestinian protesters charged in relation to an incident at the Elbit UK, part of Elbit Systems, a global Israeli defence firm. Zoe was eventually charged with criminal damage, violent disorder and aggravated burglary and denied bail. Her trial is not set to take place until November 2025. ""The idea of my daughter being branded a terrorist just fills me with horror,"" Clare said. She added: ""Someone who believes so passionately in justice, is lamenting the deaths of innocent civilians and children. To be called a terrorist? ""That really disgusts me. ""It makes me very angry and it worries me about the future of activists in this country, and the expression of free speech. "" Although Zoe was not charged with a terror offence, she and the other activists arrested at the same time were denied bail because the Crown Prosecution Service claimed there might still be a terror link. It was Zoe's first alleged offence. ""The day she appeared in court I will remember for the rest of my life. I hadn't seen her for seven days. I hadn't been able to speak to her,"" recalled Clare tearfully. ""The judge said 'no bail', and the next few seconds she was led out of the courtroom. ""That memory, it will stay with me forever. It was literally my child being taken away from me. I will never rid myself of that memory and the trauma that went with it. "" ""She is someone who is very loving and very shy,"" Clare says of her daughter. ""She thinks very deeply and cares very deeply about social justice. She started to see what was unfolding in Gaza and that became a huge part of her life. ""Zoe went on most of the pro-Gaza marches calling for an immediate ceasefire, but started to feel disheartened. ""She said to me: 'Mum the marches aren't working, the government's not listening. '"" Sukaina Rajwani is from Merton in south London. Her daughter Fatema Zainab was also arrested and charged as part of the same operation, and is also being held without bail. ""I believe the counter-terrorism legislation was used to intimidate and scare them and used as an excuse to keep them for longer,"" she told BBC London. ""I honestly thought she would get bail because she doesn't have a criminal record or convictions. She met all the bail conditions. ""She is literally a baby for me. She had only just turned 20 a week before. ""Neither Clare nor Sukaina say they had any idea that their daughters might have been planning  direct action with the group Palestine Action. In a statement to the BBC, Palestine Action defended direct action and condemned the use of anti-terror laws. ""Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons producer, market their arms as ""battle-tested"" on the Palestinian people,"" it said. ""By misusing counter-terrorism powers against those who take direct action to shut Elbit down, the state is prioritising the interests of a foreign weapons manufacturer over the rights and freedoms of its own citizens. ""Elbit Systems UK told the BBC: ""We are proud to provide critical support and advanced technology to the British armed forces from our sites in Bristol, and this work has continued uninterrupted today. ""Any claims that these facilities supply the Israeli military or Israeli Ministry of Defence are completely false. ” Some UK human rights organisations are concerned the legal definition of terrorism is too wide and is increasingly being used to crack down on legitimate protest and free speech. And organisations such as the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are also worried about the use of counter-terror legislation by police. Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, said: “The rise in the use of counter-terror legislation by British police against journalists is alarming and we are concerned recent cases are without clear or sufficient explanation to those under investigation. ""Being able to report freely on issues in the public interest without fear of arrest is a fair expectation for every journalist abiding by the union’s code of conduct. We have urged an end to the apparent targeting for its harm on a free press and the risks posed to both journalists and their sources. ”However, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, external, Jonathan Hall KC, believes the law is being correctly used on the whole. ""Just gluing yourself to the road is never going to be terrorism. Holding a placard is never going to be terrorism unless it's for a proscribed organisation. It's got to be serious violence against people or serious damage to property. ""It's got to hit that seriousness threshold before that could even apply. ""But he says it is a fair criticism that the authorities hold a huge amount of power in the context of terrorism arrests. These situations, he says, are an operational decision for the police. Michael Mansfield KC is a leading barrister in human rights and civil liberties. Without commenting on this specific case, he told the BBC that he believed protest was a right, not a crime. “There are very serious concerns and have been since the beginning that governments of whatever hue, governments may use this legislation to clamp down on protests. ”“Being a terrorist under the Act, it isn't just a matter of holding extreme views. Extreme views are not enough. ”“So I think it requires responsible prosecutors who look very carefully before attaching that label. And of course, protest has become criminalised. ”""Whether the crime you've committed is terrorism, that is the question,"" Mr Mansfield added. ""Some of these issues are in the eye of the beholder. "" The probability of being held without bail until November 2025 has had a dramatic effect on the lives of both Zoe and Fatema, whose university places are at stake. ""She should be at university now. She'd got a place to start this autumn, her first year at university,"" said Clare of her daughter, who has been diagnosed as autistic. ""She worked so hard for that place. She had to do an extra year of sixth form because of Covid; she didn't get the A-levels she needed for her chosen university. ""She did another year of study, got the place, and now she can't start. She can't even start next year, because she will be standing trial. That has been devastating for her. ""Fatema Zainab would be doing her final year in media studies at Goldsmith University were she not behind bars. ""God forbid if they do not get bail on their next appeal, then she will try to defer for another year, "" said Sukaina. ""It's all unchartered waters. Every day brings a new challenge. "" I asked Clare whether there is a difference between the right to free speech and direct action. ""Someone taking direct action to disrupt the Israeli arms industry, there is a law that oversees that and it is called criminal damage,"" she maintains. ""It's not terrorism. "" ""If you look at what the suffragettes did, they were quite violent, they destroyed property, they put bricks through windows. We look on them as heroes. ""I think people will look back at people who took direct action in this context as heroes in the future.

It was supposed to have been cleared. They had found eight bodies - including three children and three women - and taken the many injured to hospitals; some were in a critical condition. Then several men on a balcony in a building opposite started shouting: “A hand, a hand. We can see a hand. ”They were pointing at a balcony on the second floor, which was completely destroyed and had crumbled on to the collapsed floor below. A young man climbed on to the mound of rubble. He reached the spot, moved some of the rubble, then held something up that could not be identified from distance. Later, I asked him if he did find a hand. He replied: “No. It wasn’t a hand. It was a piece of bone from a head. ” The multi-storey building that was hit is located in a residential area. We were told that most of the people there were internally displaced, mainly from the south of the country or the southern suburbs of Beirut. They are areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence and which have been frequently targeted by Israel during its war with the Iran-backed political and military group. Aramoun is a religiously mixed area and until Wednesday it was deemed safe because it had not been hit before. The dawn strike came without warning. “It was around 4 o’clock in the morning. We were asleep. We woke up because of a very strong thud. We couldn’t see anything in the beginning because of the smoke that was everywhere,” said a mother of two who lived in the building opposite. She had sought refuge in her uncle’s house in Aramoun after Israel started bombing Beirut’s southern suburbs. “Israel is striking everywhere. There is nowhere that is safe anymore,” she added. Another woman in her 80s was being rushed to a car. She had moved to Aramoun a month ago, also from Beirut’s southern suburbs. After the strike, she left with everyone else in the building and spent two or three hours in their car on the street. When we saw her, she was collecting some of her possessions. She told us she was very scared and was moving once more. This time, she said, she was going to her son’s place. He is displaced as well. When asked about any prospects of an end of hostilities soon, she replied: “The more they talk about a ceasefire, the more Israel intensifies its strikes. ” The Israeli military has not yet said who or what it targeted in Aramoun. But the strike bore similarities to several in other parts of the country: launched without warning on residential buildings or houses hosting displaced people. The Israeli military has said many of those strikes have targeted Hezbollah infrastructure. The attacks are causing increasing social unease within host communities, with residents voicing concern over the possibility of Israel targeting displaced people living among them or others visiting, often to deliver financial assistance. “We all love the resistance [Hezbollah], but if someone has a son and isn’t even sure he is in Hezbollah, or someone is coming to give aid to displaced people and they are being targeted, we are paying the price,” said one man who owns house in the area that was struck and lives there with his wife and child. He added: “The displaced came as guests and we welcome them. But if there is someone stranger here, whoever he is - it might be my own son and I’m not aware of him being in Hezbollah - and they target him, and children and women get killed, isn’t that pitiful?”Such comments have become more common following the recent series of Israeli strikes in various parts of the country which are outside the known areas of hostilities. But at the same time there are increasing calls in Lebanon for national unity as well as warnings that such strikes from Israel could be purposely designed to create that social unease.",'Nowhere is safe': Concerns grow as Israel strikes new areas of Lebanon,'Nowhere is safe': Concerns grow as Israel strikes new areas of Lebanon,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9nze488gxo,articles/article_2836.txt,results/article_2836.txt.json
2837,2024-08-11 23:51:31.797000+00:00,/news/articles/cd735zvg1q9o,"When a white van drew up next to the office of the Palestine Customs Police in Tubas, a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Abdel Nasser Sarhan had no reason to be suspicious. According to Abdel Nasser's colleagues, the van’s driver got out and greeted him in Arabic. It was early in the morning. The 24-year-old uniformed policeman had just come on shift. CCTV pictures show him strolling out past a guard post, his rifle slung casually at his side. Seconds later, a man in jeans and a dark T-shirt emerges from the direction of the white van, uniformed Israeli soldiers behind him. He raises a handgun and shoots Abdel Nasser dead. Soon, the street is full of Israeli soldiers. They retrieve Abdel Nasser's rifle and, as his colleagues try to retrieve his body, continue to shoot – all captured on CCTV.  When we visited Tubas the following morning, in late July, we found a makeshift memorial of stones and wilting flowers on the ground where Abdel Nasser fell. The guard post and adjacent walls were riddled with bullet holes, each marked with a yellow tag. Fading bloodstains smeared the ground and doorway. In a statement released on the day of the incident, the Israeli army said the shooting occurred in the course of an operation to detain two wanted men. Abdel Nasser’s colleagues in Tubas said those arrests took place at a nearby house. The army said that soldiers had “encountered armed terrorists” and that “a customs officer of the Palestinian Authority was killed during exchanges of fire”. From the evidence of the CCTV footage, this last statement is demonstrably false. An Israeli security official contacted by the BBC two weeks later said the incident was “one of hundreds, if not thousands of special activities that are planned and carried out very precisely"". This one was being reviewed, he said, “because it didn’t go as planned"". It seems clear that this was an operation that went badly wrong. No-one has suggested that Abdel Nasser or the customs office were the target of the operation. The young guard appears to have had the misfortune to stumble across an undercover Israeli operation, during which he was shot and killed.  But for Abdel Nasser’s colleagues in the customs police, this tragic episode is part of a wider pattern of behaviour that is making it harder than ever for the Palestinian Authority – theoretically responsible for security in areas not under direct Israeli military control – to do its job. “This rings a warning bell, especially for us in the security services,” Lt Ibrahim Ayyash, spokesman for the Palestine Customs Police, told us. “How can we enforce law and order and offer services to the people and protect them while you’re obstructing my work and killing my officers?”Customs officers, he said, were increasingly reluctant to pull over suspicious vehicles, for fear of stumbling across Israeli soldiers operating under cover. “It now falls on you, as a custom officer, to take a decision about stopping a vehicle or not,” he said. “If you stop it and it has Special Forces [inside], they could kill you. ”As fans of the Israeli TV show Fauda will know, undercover operations were already a regular feature of life in the West Bank long before the war in Gaza broke out last October. Recent evidence suggests the frequency of such operations have increased, with multiple cases of CCTV pictures showing Israeli units, dressed as civilians, and even medics, snatching wanted Palestinians from city streets and hospital beds. But such clandestine operations are part of a much bigger picture. With all eyes focused on Gaza, another war is raging in the West Bank, as the Israeli military cracks down on armed groups that it says are being bankrolled by Iran. “The situation on the ground is very, very complicated,” an Israeli security official told me, on condition of anonymity. “You might say that it's on the verge of an explosion. ” The emergence of a new generation of local armed groups, mostly in the refugee camps of the northern West Bank, dates back to about 2021, with the first group appearing in Jenin. But the war in Gaza has fanned the flames of rebellion in other cities, from Tulkarem to Qalqilya and, more recently, Tubas. Israel’s security crackdown, the actions of violent groups of Jewish settlers and the belief that the Palestinian Authority is powerless to protect them have all added to an atmosphere of mounting tension. “They're very frustrated with Israel, they're very frustrated with the Palestinian Authority and they're looking for an outlet to this frustration,” the Israeli security official said. The PA health ministry says more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since last October. As many as 10,000 have been arrested, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society. At least 18 Israelis, including 12 security forces personnel, have also been killed in the West Bank. On Saturday, one Israeli was killed and another injured when Palestinian gunmen opened fire near the Israeli settlement of Mehola. Later in the day, Hamas said it had carried out the attack in retaliation for the Israeli air strike which killed dozens of Palestinians sheltering in a school in Gaza City. Some veteran observers fear that armed clashes could erupt into a full-scale uprising, or intifada. “If it goes into an intifada, this is a much, much bigger problem,” Gen Israel Ziv, former head of the IDF’s Operations Division, told me. “Militarily, we handle things better or worse. But when it goes into an intifada, it's a totally different story. And it might go there. ”With the Israeli military still focused on the war in Gaza and its simmering conflict with Hezbollah along its northern border, Gen Ziv said there’s reluctance to recognise danger much closer to home. “It's a huge problem that can blow up in our face in a more sensitive area, [close] to the centres of population in Israel,” he said. Meanwhile, in the Balata refugee camp, on the edge of Nablus, Abdel Nasser’s family is still grieving. They’ve watched the CCTV pictures from Tubas and drawn their own conclusions about the actions of the Israeli army. “He come to kill, just to kill,” Abdel Nasser’s uncle, Ismail Mohammed Sarhan, says. Abdel Nasser’s father, Mohannad, can barely comprehend the loss of his son. What was he like, I asked him. “Ambitious, kind, always smiling,” he said, unable to hold back the tears.",'On verge of an explosion': Policeman's killing part of spiralling West Bank violence,'On verge of an explosion': Policeman's killing part of spiralling West Bank violence,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd735zvg1q9o,articles/article_2837.txt,results/article_2837.txt.json
2838,2024-08-02 23:06:33.025000+00:00,/news/articles/c728vj21qepo,"For six years the BBC’s Paul Adams has been in contact with a young graduate in Gaza. Her text messages give a unique insight into the terrors and small triumphs she has experienced during the current conflict, and her fears for the future. My phone lights up. It is Asmaa. “Still alive,” she writes. It is 19 March 2024 and after several weeks of silence, Asmaa Tayeh has reappeared on WhatsApp. “Sorry. Bad internet connection and dangerous days. ” And then silence. For another two months. It has been like this since 7 October. Long disappearances, punctuated by flurries of text messages, as the 28-year-old emerges, briefly, amid the nightmare of Gaza’s longest war. It is always late at night. Somewhere, Asmaa has found a signal. Far away in London, my phone pings as the messages tumble in. I met Asmaa in 2018. I was in Gaza, reporting on daily protests at the border fence with Israel, where thousands of mostly young Palestinians angrily commemorated their ancestors’ displacement during Israel’s War of Independence, 70 years earlier. Asmaa was not part of the protests. I found her at her family’s home a few miles away in Jabalia, quietly writing stories, some of which I had read online, about daily life in a place she both loved and hated. Her laptop was a cherished portal to the world outside. She had only ever known the Gaza Strip and its stifling sense of isolation. From her spartan room, she watched vloggers and Youtubers casually exploring places she could only dream of. As a recent graduate in a place with few job prospects and frequent outbreaks of extreme violence, the exotic images flashing onto her computer screen were intoxicating but painful. “They show me how handcuffed I am,” she wrote that year. A refugee camp of tents and tin shacks in the 1950s, Jabalia had long since morphed into a small city, more than 100,000 people crammed together in a place of tall buildings, teeming alleyways and open sewers. Despite her narrow confines, the young Asmaa was hopeful. In September 2022, she launched her own business, Star Café, an online coffee delivery service. Her social media feeds suggested an optimistic young entrepreneur, finally achieving long-cherished goals and planning for the future. A year later, on 6 October 2023, in an Instagram post artfully depicting her branded products alongside a vase of roses and a manicured hand, she thanked God for “the blessing of self-employment”. But what she didn’t know was that a meteor was hurtling in her direction, about to obliterate everything. The following day, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border fence, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners in nearby communities and at the Nova music festival. Israel’s response was like nothing Gazans had ever seen before. Its military would go on to kill tens of thousands of people, displace more than 80% of the population, and render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable. Three days later, on 10 October, Asmaa got in touch. “Hey Paul. It’s nice to hear from you. We are unharmed,” she messaged. “But to be honest, I don’t feel safe at all. We could be bombed at any minute. ”Despite hearing air strikes hitting nearby targets, Asmaa was hopeful the war would soon be over. But this was not a repeat of earlier Gaza wars. Within days, Israeli planes dropped leaflets, telling everyone in the northern Gaza Strip - more than one million people - to move south. Jabalia started to empty, but Asmaa’s family - 13 people spanning three generations - stayed put, fearing going south would prove a one-way journey. For the descendants of refugees who were forced or fled from their homes in 1948, never to return, the thought of history repeating itself stirred deep fears. Only her grandparents, elderly and frail, travelled, eventually finding shelter in Rafah. With electricity cut, food in freezers spoiling, and communications increasingly difficult, the family used a small generator every couple of days to charge mobiles and monitor the news. Asmaa’s messages were becoming increasingly sporadic. “It’s dangerous all over the Gaza Strip,” she told me on 15 October. At the end of October, Jabalia experienced its worst air strikes so far. Israel said it had targeted underground Hamas structures and killed large numbers of fighters. The scenes were apocalyptic, with civilians and rescue workers searching for survivors through vast craters and wrecked buildings. Asmaa vanished. My WhatsApp messages were no longer being read. I assumed the worst. But six weeks later, she suddenly reappeared. “I’m still alive, by God’s miracles,” she wrote on 12 December. It did, indeed, feel miraculous. In a torrent of messages that followed, Asmaa described the previous chaotic weeks. The family’s reluctant decision to leave Jabalia, efforts to head south thwarted by the intensity of the fighting, terrifying journeys through a city at war. “I saw so much that I cannot find words to describe,” she said. “The streets are scary and the smell of death is everywhere. People are getting skinny and sick. I feel like I’m living inside a horror movie. ”When forced to walk, the family would spread out along the road, hoping this would improve their chances of survival. “We kept distance between us, so if any air strike comes, not all of us will die. ”During a week-long ceasefire in late November, the family had briefly returned to the house in Jabalia. The top floor was gone. Asmaa’s own room, which had doubled up as her Star Café office and studio, was pockmarked by shrapnel. When the ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, they fled once more, finding refuge in a printing shop in Gaza City where one of Asmaa’s brothers had worked before the war. It was filthy, reeked of paint, and had no kitchen, mattresses, or water. “We basically lived with rats,” she says. When it was safe enough to go outside, they would walk, sometimes for hours, searching for clean water - especially vital to make up the formula for Asmaa’s two-month-old nephew. But after less than three weeks in the shop, Asmaa got a phone call from the Israeli army. She was used to the army’s recorded messages and leaflets dropped from the sky, with instructions to leave areas about to be attacked. But this time she found herself talking to a real person. The man said Israel was about to start an operation nearby. For her safety, and that of her family, she needed to leave. “I wanted to curse him, but I couldn’t. ”She says she was curious, after two-and-a-half months of war, to find herself speaking to an Israeli. She imagined what it must feel like to spend your whole day making the same phone call over and over. “I felt like there is on the other side an employee who’s sick of his work. ”For all the horrifying immediacy of the war consuming the north, this was as close as Asmaa ever came to meeting an Israeli soldier. Part of her wishes that she’d had more contact. “I’m really curious about the way they’re fighting, how they look at us, how they understand the struggle,” she told me later. “I feel like I need to dive inside their minds. ” At the end of December, as the bulk of the fighting moved south, the family made its weary way back to the house in Jabalia. “We started the new year in the best way ever - all together in our partially-destroyed home. ”Asmaa’s father,  a retired carpenter, spent the following weeks repairing the damage, fixing windows, doors and cupboards. But food was in desperately short supply. International aid agencies warned that famine was looming. Asmaa noticed that people in Jabalia were starting to look gaunt. Asmaa’s family had stocked up on canned goods. But flour, meat, fruit and vegetables had all disappeared from the markets. Aid agencies were struggling to bring humanitarian relief to the north. The family eked out their dwindling rations, ate twice a day, and drank tea without sugar - something practically unheard of among Palestinians. On the roof of the house, where her brother’s room had once stood, her father started growing vegetables. Asmaa had lost 9kg (almost 20lb) and felt her appetite ebbing away. But slowly, the humanitarian situation started to improve. Air drops and new aid routes into the north kept famine at bay. Flour was back. The family had chicken and tomatoes for the first time in months. There was more water, too. Enough for the occasional shower. “We started to feel a little bit settled down. ”But then the war came back. On 12 May, the Israeli army returned to Jabalia, saying intelligence indicated Hamas was once more operating out of the area. Asmaa was bewildered. “Only days ago, they were talking about a very possible ceasefire,” she wrote, “and suddenly I woke to ‘Let’s pack, we have to leave asap. ’”The family went west, to an area known as al-Nasr, near the coast, where her grandparents had lived before the war. Al-Nasr was a wasteland, much of it reduced to rubble months earlier. But her grandparents’ house was intact. Long-since looted following their departure for the south, but somehow undamaged. The family moved in and settled down, wondering how long this third dislocation would last. One day, driven by curiosity, Asmaa walked to the nearby beach, where she marvelled at the sight of Gazans frolicking in the waves, despite the ominous presence of Israeli gunboats patrolling offshore. “We’ve started to feel careless,” she told me. “We don’t care for our lives any more. That’s how tired we are. ” On 19 May came the news that Asmaa had long dreaded. Her grandfather had died the day before, aged 91. After being forced to move repeatedly, he and his wife had recently settled in a tent in al-Mawasi, a desperately overcrowded place of dismal conditions, where many Palestinians had fled after the Israeli army began an operation in Rafah at the start of the month. Sheltering in his abandoned house, Asmaa felt bereft. She hadn’t seen her grandfather since just before the war, when she had persuaded him to pose for a selfie. “I was so happy that I managed to take that memory. ”Israeli forces finally left Jabalia on 1 June. Four days later, the family trudged back through streets so ravaged they were barely recognisable, to find their home still standing but increasingly battle-scarred. The whole process - of cleaning, repairing and planting - had to start again, made harder this time by the fact that a missile had destroyed the workshop where her father kept all his tools. For months, Asmaa and I had only ever communicated by text. Finally, in early July,  we spoke on the phone. Two long conversations in which Asmaa took me through her Gazan odyssey and described how it had changed her. Each time, her voice faded in and out and the line crackled, creating the impression of enormous distance. Each time, Israeli drones, ubiquitous since this war began, could be heard buzzing in the background. Asmaa said survival was a mixed blessing. Everyone in the house was alive. But the war wasn’t over and the threat of death was constant. “I feel anxious all the time, thinking that there will be one day in which I will lose something,” she said. “I mean, our turn will come. ” Gaza, where Asmaa had nurtured her dreams, had been devastated. But it wasn’t the physical changes that were absorbing her the most. Society, she said, had been utterly transformed. The constant shocks of death, displacement and trauma leaving whole neighbourhoods teetering on the brink of disintegration. Tight-knit communities had been blown apart, she said, with family members and neighbours scattered up and down the length of the Gaza Strip, and beyond. Sometimes, in the struggle for survival, Gazans had turned on themselves. A total breakdown in law and order leaving gangs and rival families to battle it out for control of precious resources. “It’s becoming really normal to see people even killing each other,” Asmaa said. But if war had brought out the worst in people, it had also brought out the best. In Jabalia, Asmaa said, people were sharing food and water, exchanging the latest news and information on where to charge mobile phones. With basic foodstuffs once again in short supply, women were swapping improvised recipes. “Everyone is really taking care of each other. ”Asmaa said it would take decades for Gazans to recover the meagre, confined, life they knew before 7 October. Defiant talk of reconstruction and renewal, she said, felt delusional. As for herself, Asmaa’s only dream now was to escape. “I don’t have any hope in this place,” she told me. “I’m not the same person any more. I don’t think I’ll recover. ”",'Still alive' - graduate Asmaa's texts to BBC from the ruins of Gaza,'Still alive' - graduate Asmaa's texts to BBC from the ruins of Gaza,"palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c728vj21qepo,articles/article_2838.txt,results/article_2838.txt.json
2839,2024-09-26 13:14:15.185000+00:00,/news/articles/cly3g1dplppo,"Israel's attacks on Hezbollah targets have had terrifying effects on local civilians, who have been forced to flee place after place in search of safety. Cross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have left tens of thousands of people displaced on both sides. In Lebanon, recent Israeli air strikes have killed 600 people and left thousands of injured and another 90,000 newly displaced. Some of those abandoning their houses told the BBC of their experiences, leaving their possessions behind and having to rely on strangers to survive. Among them is Valentine Nesser, a journalist who fled southern Lebanon with her mother and brother on Monday, when an intense bombardment made it Lebanon's deadliest day in decades. ""We went to Mount Lebanon, about 30 minutes from Beirut, which is currently considered a safe zone,"" she said. The journey took them 15 hours because of severe traffic jams as thousands tried to get away. ""We came here without anything, because the bombs were everywhere and we want to be safe as soon as possible,"" she added. ""We are staying in a hotel that's been converted into a displaced centre and there are more than 300 people here now, with the number increasing. ""We have, like, 50 people in the same room. Many people still haven't found a place to stay and some have been forced to sleep in their cars. ""She said local authorities were providing food and water, adding that although she had lived through periods of conflict before, this time was different. ""This time is more tension, more sadness, more anger. "" Those in eastern Lebanon, which has seen fewer air strikes than the south, are hoping to avoid the worst of the conflict, with some volunteers providing support. Amani Deni lives in Beirut and came back to her mother's house in the Bekaa Valley a few days ago. She says: “I have 13 relatives staying with me and my mum, they were displaced from the Baalbek area. They are all staying together in our house, which has only one bedroom and one living room. ""I had to sit with the kids and say, 'We do have air strikes in this area, the Bekaa Valley too, but it’s safer than Baalbek where you come from. '”“I am also volunteering in the schools which are housing – helping get them food. The situation is really hard. ""Several schools in my town have refugees in them – many, many people from all over Lebanon - but mainly coming from the south. ""Local people, volunteers, are taking food from our houses and trying to support these people. We have been trying to talk to children, to do psychological first aid. They are panicking and we try to play with them to calm them down. ""They were crying as they were hungry.

He told the BBC there was no sense of safety in the region and people were unsure of what was going to happen next. ""In the Bekaa area, we don't have many exits,"" he said. ""If you want to flee, you can flee to Syria, and the question is, is Syria a safe place for us? These questions come up in people's minds, and you feel like you're lost.

2840,2024-10-01 14:04:12.574000+00:00,/news/articles/cj9jzv4deg9o,"For the past few days, there was a feeling in Lebanon that an Israeli ground invasion into the country’s south was almost inevitable as Israel indicated its campaign against Hezbollah would not stop with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, who, for three decades, was the face of the group. Now that this has been confirmed, with what the Israeli military describes as a “limited, localised and targeted” operation, the fear is that this could be the start of something wider. History shows that it is easy for Israeli troops to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. “The country is lost,” a Lebanese friend texted me. Another one wrote: “If you ask me what’s coming, my answer is it will be very long and hard days are coming”. A third said: “We just need to hope for the best. ” There is a feeling that history is repeating itself, and uncertainty about what happens next. It remains unclear whether Hezbollah can still organise any significant and co-ordinated response. It continues to fire rockets at Israel, but not at the same intensity. Meanwhile, this is a country under pressure, struggling with the sheer number of casualties from Israeli air strikes and one million people who have already been displaced. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group armed and financed by Iran, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others, but is more than just a militia in Lebanon. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support. Powerful and influential, Hezbollah, which means Party of God, is often described as a state within a state in Lebanon. It has been weakened by two weeks of unrelenting Israeli air strikes and high-profile assassinations, but has not been defeated. In a defiant speech on Monday, the Hezbollah number two, Naim Qassem, said its fighters were ready to resist any Israeli invasion. Before this latest escalation, Hezbollah’s armed wing, which includes a vast arsenal of weapons and thousands of battled-hardened fighters, was said to be stronger than the Lebanese army, and the country’s authorities have little say - if any - over the group’s actions. For almost a year, as Hezbollah carried out near-daily cross-border attacks on Israel, many outside its support base in Lebanon feared that this country, already struggling to recover from years of successive crises, was being dragged into a conflict that it has not chosen to fight. The economy has essentially collapsed, and political impasse means the country has been without a president for almost two years. Here, there are still memories of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, when parts of southern Lebanon and Dahieh, the group’s base in Beirut’s southern suburbs, were flattened. Hezbollah’s rivals will not be disappointed to see a weakened group who, many say, is interested in defending its own interests - and those of its main supporter, Iran. Hezbollah is the most powerful group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance of factions across the Middle East supported by Iran that also includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq and Syria. Having a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon, right next to Israel, has always been vital for Iran, part of its deterrence against any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities. Yesterday, outside a building in central Beirut hit by an Israeli strike, a resident told me: “I’m against Israel, who is killing us, but I’m against Iran, who is killing us as well”. This is, obviously, rejected by Hezbollah supporters. “We shed tears of blood over the [Israeli] strike against Nasrallah, may God grant him paradise… He’s irreplaceable,” one of them said, after being forced to flee Dahieh. “We don’t fear [Israel]. We’re still standing. ”",'The country is lost': Fear and uncertainty in Lebanon as Israel invades,'The country is lost': Fear and uncertainty in Lebanon as Israel invades,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9jzv4deg9o,articles/article_2840.txt,results/article_2840.txt.json
2841,2024-11-08 12:52:17.583000+00:00,/news/articles/ckgv4mdr9y8o,"Israeli football fans have described being attacked by groups of young men in Amsterdam, with some left with injuries including broken noses. Adi Reuben, 24, said he was kicked on the ground and had his nose broken when he and his friends were confronted by a group of over 10 men while walking back to their hotel. The men asked Mr Reuben where he and his friends were from. ""They shouted 'Jewish, Jewish, IDF, IDF',” he said, referring to the Israeli military. Police say the violence involved men on scooters carrying out ""hit and run"" attacks which were difficult to prevent. ""They started to mess with me and I realised I had to run, but it was dark and I didn't know where to go. I fell to the floor and 10 people were kicking me. They were shouting ‘Palestine’,"" Mr Reuben told the BBC. ""They were kicking me on the floor for about a minute, then they walked off, they weren’t afraid of anything. “I realised I had full blood on my face and my nose was broken and it is very painful. "" Mr Reuben said he could not see properly for about 30 minutes, but decided against going to hospital in Amsterdam because he had heard that taxi drivers were involved in the violence. Instead he said he was flying to Israel on Friday afternoon and would get medical treatment there. He added that it appeared to be ""a specific attack that was organised beforehand"". Some Israeli football fans said they were ordered to show their passports when they were set upon. Gal Binyanmin Tshuva, 29, told the BBC he was attacked on Wednesday outside a casino after watching a different football game. ""We faced around 20 people who ran towards us. They asked me where I was from, and I said I was from Greece. They said they didn’t believe me and they asked to see my passport. When he told them he didn't have it, the men beat him, pushed him to the ground and kicked his face, Mr Tshuva said. ""I don’t remember anything after that, and I woke up in an ambulance with blood all over my face, and realised they had broken two of my teeth. ""British men Aaron and Jacob, who are Jewish, told the BBC they went to the match, but left early. Afterwards, they said they saw men yelling antisemitic threats and stamping on an Israeli man. They intervened, helped the man to his feet, and went to leave. Shortly after, a group asked the men if they were Jewish, and Aaron said that they were British. “But they said ‘you helped the Jew’, and he punched me in my face and broke my glasses,"" Aaron said. “I was bleeding and have a black eye. I’m okay but a bit shaken. ""The BBC has seen a photo of Aaron that shows a stream of blood running down his nose, his eye swollen and other cuts on his face. Esther Voet, editor-in-chief of a Dutch Jewish weekly newspaper, lives in the city centre. She says she offered her home to Israeli fans after she saw footage of the violence. ""I told them this is a Jewish home and you are safe here,"" she told Israeli public broadcaster Kann. ""People were really scared. I never thought I would go through this in Amsterdam. ""Dutch police said Israeli fans had suffered ""serious abuses"" during ""hit-and-run"" attacks, many carried out by young men on scooters. Amsterdam police chief Peter Holla said it had proven difficult to prevent such attacks even with a significant number of officers present. The force eventually decided to bring Maccabi supporters together and protect them before transporting them out of the area in buses, he said. The attacks overnight into Friday followed some tensions between Maccabi fans and people in Amsterdam over previous days, officials said. On Wednesday Maccabi fans attacked a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag, police chief Holla said. There were further clashes in Dam Square overnight into Thursday but police were mostly able to keep the groups separate. Some Maccabi Tel Aviv fans have previously been involved in racist incidents in Israel, including cursing at the team’s Palestinian and Arab players and reportedly applying pressure on the team to oust them. Fans of the team have also previously attacked protesters demonstrating against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Asked about video footage appearing to show Maccabi fans in Amsterdam chanting offensive slogans, Mayor Halsema said: ""What happened last night has nothing to do with protest. There is no excuse for what happened.

2842,2024-10-29 18:09:53.907000+00:00,/news/articles/cr4lryx7304o,"People in war-torn Gaza are already struggling with a deep humanitarian crisis - but now they fear it will get much more difficult because of Israel’s ban on the biggest UN agency which operates there. “Unrwa means everything to us: it is our life, our food, our drink and our medical care. When it closes, there will be no flour. If my son gets sick, where will I go?” asks Yasmine el-Ashry in Khan Younis. “Banning Unrwa is another war for the Palestinian people,” said registered refugee Saeed Awida. “They want to exterminate the Palestinian people and not provide us with humanitarian services. ” Despite international opposition, in Israel’s parliament there was wide support for the new legislation, which will prevent Israeli officials being in contact with Unrwa - the UN's relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees in the Near East. The agency is accused of being complicit with Hamas. ""A terrorist organisation has completely taken over it,” claims Sharren Haskel from the opposition National Unity Party - a co-sponsor of the bill.  ""If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organisation from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure they cannot harm our people ever again. ""Unrwa insists on its own neutrality.  It says that if the new Israeli laws against it are implemented as planned in three-months’ time, the effect will be profound, particularly in the occupied Palestinian territories. “It would essentially make it impossible for us to operate in Gaza,” Sam Rose, Unrwa’s Gaza deputy director, has said. “We wouldn’t be able to bring in supplies, because that has to take place in co-ordination with Israeli officials. It wouldn’t further be able for us to manage our movements safely in and out of Gaza around checkpoints, but just in and around conflict zones. ”He points out that the protected status of Unrwa schools, clinics and other buildings where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have been sheltering would effectively be lost. Israeli media suggest that there were warnings from diplomats and the security establishment about the consequences of taking action against Unrwa.  Israel stands accused of being in breach of the UN charter and its obligations under international humanitarian law. However, ultimately domestic politics outweighed these considerationsUnrwa was set up in 1949 by the UN General Assembly in the wake of the first Arab-Israeli war which followed the creation of the state of Israel.  It helped some 700,000 Palestinians who had fled or been forced from their homes. Seven decades on, with the descendants of those original refugees registered, the number of Palestinians supported by Unrwa has grown to six million across Gaza, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.  It helps them with aid, assistance, education and health services. The agency has long been a lightning rod for Israeli criticism, for example with allegations that the textbooks used in its schools promote hatred of Israel.  However, this has grown dramatically since Hamas’s 7 October attack last year. Last week, Unrwa confirmed that a Hamas commander killed in an Israeli strike had been an employee since 2022.  He was apparently filmed leading the killing and kidnapping of Israelis from a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im. The UN launched an investigation after Israel charged that 12 Unrwa staff took part in the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel; seven more cases later came to light.  In August, Unrwa said that nine staff members out of the thousands it employs in Gaza may have been involved in the attacks and had been fired. “We have taken immediate and strong and direct action against any allegations that we have received,” maintains Sam Rose. Israel has long complained that the existence of Unrwa perpetuates the problem of Palestinian refugees – a core issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  UN officials counter that this can only be solved as part of a negotiated political settlement. But in Gaza, where most of the 2.3 million population are registered refugees, the new actions against Unrwa are also seen as a troubling attack on their status. “I am telling you that the word “refugee” will disappear. They do not want the word refugee. Israel is looking for this,” Mohammed Salman from Deir al-Balah told the BBC.",'Unrwa means everything to us': Gazans fear aid collapse ,'Unrwa means everything to us': Gazans fear aid collapse ,"palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4lryx7304o,articles/article_2842.txt,results/article_2842.txt.json

The civil engineer, 29, was standing about 5m (16ft) away from the explosion, which destroyed a house in his village in southern Lebanon. Layers of skin were scorched from his forehead and his cheeks, leaving his face raw and pink. His hands were charred. His abdomen has third-degree burns. Two weeks on he radiates pain, and trauma, but wants to tell his story. “It was all black, smoke everywhere,” he says in a low voice. “It took about a minute. Then I started to recognise what is around me. I noticed my two friends were still alive but bleeding a lot. It took about five minutes for the people to get us out. ”Mohammed recounts the horrors from his bed in the Nabih Berri government hospital, which is perched on a hilltop in Nabatieh. It is one of the biggest cities in the south, and just 11km (seven miles) from the border with Israel, as the crow flies. Before the war it was home to about 80,000 people. Mohammed says there was no warning before the strike – “not at all, not to us, not to our neighbours, not to the person inside the house that was hit. ” That person was a policeman, he says, who was killed in the attack. “We are not military,” he says, “we are not terrorists. Why are we being hit? The areas that are being hit are all civilian areas. ”Mohammed will return home to his village, Arab Salim, when he is discharged, though it remains under fire. “I don't have anywhere else to go,” he says. “If I could [leave] I would. There's no place. ” As we tour the hospital, another air strike sends staff rushing to a balcony, to check what has been hit this time. The hospital offers a panoramic view of grey smoke billowing from high ground about 4km away. Shortly afterwards, a few floors down in the emergency room, the wail of a siren warns of casualties arriving – from that air strike. It had hit Mohammed’s village, Arab Salim. A woman is rushed in on a stretcher, with blood streaming down her face. She is followed by her husband, who hits a wall in frustration before slumping over in shock. Doctors disappear behind closed doors to examine her. Within minutes the hospital director, Dr Hassan Wazni, tells staff she has a ruptured artery and must be moved to a specialised vascular centre in a hospital further north. ""She needs it immediately,"" he says, as cries of pain come from the examining room. ""Talk to Saida [a nearby town]. If it’s OK, let’s take her immediately, because she can’t wait. "" The hospital receives 20-30 casualties from Israeli air strikes a day. Most are civilians, but no-one is turned away. “We take all patients, and all injured, and all martyrs who come,” he says. “We don't discriminate between them. ”Dr Wazni has not left the hospital since the war began. Behind his desk in his office, he opens a packet of cigarillos. “I think it’s OK to break some rules in a war,” he says with an apologetic smile. He is struggling to pay wages and come up with 1,200 litres of fuel per day to run the generators that power the hospital. “We get nothing from the government,” he says. “It doesn’t have it. ”His fuel is espresso, which he offers us repeatedly. With 170 beds, Nabih Berri is the main public hospital in the city, but now has only a skeleton staff, and 25 patients. The sick and the wounded brought here are transferred quickly to hospitals in safer areas further North. Staff say there have been “many strikes “close to Nabih Berri. During our visit there’s broken glass inside the foyer. Nabatieh has been under fire for more than a month. The municipality building was blown up on 16 October, killing the mayor, Ahmad Kahil, and 16 others. At the time he was having a meeting to co-ordinate aid distribution. When we pass by the ruins, bundles of flat bread remain visible on the floor of a wrecked ambulance. The massive strike brought down several neighbouring buildings – a city block is missing from the landscape. Also missing is an Ottoman era market – the heart of Nabatieh – which was destroyed on 12 October. Centuries of history were crushed into rubble, heritage turned to dust. The old market, or souk, was treasured by Hussein Jaber, 30, who is part of the government’s emergency services. He and his men, some of them volunteers, take us there for a brief visit. They drive at speed - the only way to travel in Nabatieh. “We were born and raised here,” Hussein says, gesturing around at slabs of concrete and twisted metal. “We have been here since we were children. The souk means a great deal to us. It is really sad to see it like this. It holds memories of the past and the beautiful days we spent with the people of this city. ”Like Dr Wazni, Hussein and his colleagues have remained with the people, despite the risks. More than 110 paramedics and first responders have been killed in Israeli attacks in Lebanon in the past year, according to Lebanese government figures – most of them in the past month. Some attacks involve “apparent war crimes”, according to the international campaign group, Human Rights Watch. Hussein lost a colleague and a friend this month, in an air strike 50m from their civil defence station, where they sleep with mattresses up against the windows. The dead man, Naji Fahes, was 50 years old and had two children. “He was enthusiastic and strong and loved to help others,” Hussein tells me. “Even though he was older than us, he was the one rushing to go on missions, to be with the people and to rescue them. ”He died, as he lived. When the air strike happened, Naji Fahes was standing outside the station, ready to go on a mission. As Hussein speaks, we have company. An Israeli drone circles in the skies overhead, then gets lower and louder. The insistent buzzing of the drone competes with his voice. “We hear it 90% of the time,” he says. “We think it’s directly above us now. Most probably it’s watching us. ” As for Hezbollah, its presence in the city is out of sight. The Israel Defence forces (IDF) told us it is “operating solely against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, not against the Lebanese population. ”Israel says its fight is “against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, embedded within civilian population and infrastructure”. A spokesman said it “takes many measures to mitigate civilian harm including advance warnings”, though there was no warning for the air strike that wounded Mohammed, or the attack that killed the mayor. In five and a half hours in this once bustling city we saw two people out in the open, on foot. Both rushed away, unwilling to speak. During our visit a drone was broadcasting messages from the Israeli army – instructing people to leave immediately. It’s estimated that only a few hundred remain here unwilling or unable to move elsewhere. They are mainly the old and the poor, and they will live or die with their city. And Hussein and his team will be here, to come to their aid. “We are like a safety net for the people,” he says. “We will stay, and we will carry on. We will be next to the civilians. Nothing will stop us. ”Additional reporting by Wietske Burema and Angie Mrad",'We are not military - why are we being hit?','We are not military - why are we being hit?',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzp91wl66o,articles/article_2843.txt,results/article_2843.txt.json
2844,2024-09-18 20:33:34.101000+00:00,/news/articles/c781d8y397do,"Just as crowds had gathered to mourn some of those killed in Tuesday’s wave of pager-bomb attacks, an explosion sparked chaos in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. In the surrounding area there was bedlam as the sound of the explosion echoed through the streets. The chants stopped. Those gathered looked at each other, some incredulous. As reports spread that this was part of a second wave of explosions now targeting walkie-talkies, no electronic equipment was considered safe. In Dahiyeh, Hezbollah supporters stopped our team several times, demanding we did not use our phones or our camera. One of our producers received a message from a friend, who said she had changed her Lebanese SIM card to an international number, concerned that her phone could explode, too. Many people here, and across the country, are inevitably wondering what will come next. Some even say they do not know if it is safe to walk next to other people, and are changing their plans. ""Everyone is just panicking… We don’t know if we can stay next to our laptops, our phones. Everything seems like a danger at this point, and no one knows what to do,” one woman, Ghida, said. The confusion was made worse by rumours that spread on social media. One of them suggested that even solar panels were blowing up. ""A state of panic overwhelmed people,” another woman said. “And frankly, this situation is very frightening”. Wednesday’s attack, which killed 25 people, came as the country was still shocked and angered by what happened the day before, when thousands of pagers exploded in a synchronised attack, after users received a message they believed had come from Hezbollah. The devices detonated as people were in shops, or with their families at home, killing 12, including an eight-year-old girl who went to pick up the pager for her father, and an 11-year-old boy. Around 2,800 others were wounded, with hundreds needing surgery. Treating some of the injured, Dr Elias Warrak said at least 60% of the people he had seen after Tuesday's blasts had lost at least one eye, with many also losing a finger or a whole hand. He described it as ""the worst day of [his] life as a physician"". ""I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes – some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage. "" The attacks are a humiliation for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, and a possible indication that its entire communication network may have been infiltrated by Israel, the worst security breach in the group’s history. Reports suggest a shipment of pagers may have been rigged with explosives, before being detonated remotely. Hezbollah had distributed the devices amid concerns that smartphones were being used by the Israeli military and intelligence agencies to track down and kill its members. It was still not clear how Wednesday’s attacks might have been carried out. “The pain is huge, physical and in the heart. But this is something we are used to, and we will continue with our resistance,"" said a young man in Dahiyeh. A woman said: ""This will make us stronger, whoever has lost an eye will fight with the other eye and we are all standing together. ”Hezbollah has vowed to respond, blaming Israel for the attacks. As usual, Israel has not commented. Fears are, again, rising that the current violence between the two rivals, which has led to the displacement of tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border, could escalate into an all-out war. Hezbollah says its attacks on Israel, which started almost a year ago, are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and that they will only stop with a ceasefire, an elusive possibility for now. Hours after the latest explosions, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country was ""at the start of a new phase in the war"", as the 98th division of the Israeli army relocated from Gaza to the north of Israel. Up until now, Hezbollah has indicated that it is not interested in another major war with Israel, as Lebanon struggles to recover from a years-long economic crisis. Many here say a conflict is not in the country’s interests. A damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran’s interests either, as the group acts as part of the country’s deterrence against Israel. But some will certainly demand a strong response. An indication of what Hezbollah might be planning to do could come on Thursday, in the first public reaction by its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",'We don’t know if our phones are safe': Lebanon on edge after exploding device attacks,'We don’t know if our phones are safe': Lebanon on edge after exploding device attacks,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c781d8y397do,articles/article_2844.txt,results/article_2844.txt.json
2845,2024-09-23 19:14:38.264000+00:00,/news/articles/crl8xw7ww70o,"Across southern Lebanon, families scrambled together belongings and headed north in cars and trucks and on motorcycles as the Israeli military struck targets it said were linked to the Lebanese Shia armed group Hezbollah. Some residents reported receiving warnings in the form of text messages and voice recordings from the Israeli military to leave areas near the Iran-backed group’s positions. Zahra Sawli, a student in the southern town of Nabatieh told the BBC's Newshour programme the bombardment was intense. ""I woke up at 6am to the sound of bombing. By noon it started to get really intense and I saw a lot of strikes in my area. """"I heard a lot of glass shattering. ""Unlike many, she and those she was with did not leave the house - they didn't dare, she said. ""Where are we supposed to go? A lot of people are still stuck on the streets. A lot of my friends are still stuck in traffic because a lot of people are trying to flee,"" she said. Live updates: Israel strikes dozens more sites in southern LebanonBowen: Israel believes it has weakened Hezbollah but escalation still carries risksCold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflict By the middle of the day roads north towards Beirut were clogged with traffic, with vehicles heading towards the capital on both sides of a six-lane coastal highway. Other images showed people walking along the beach in the southern city of Tyre as smoke rose from air strikes in the countryside inland. The BBC spoke to one family of five who had arrived in Beirut on a single motorbike. From a village in the south, they were heading to Tripoli in the north. They were exhausted. ""What do you want us to say? We just had to flee,"" the father said. By Monday evening the Lebanese health ministry reported that 492 people had been killed and more than 1,600 injured in the bombardment. It said at least 35 children were among those killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had carried out 1,100 strikes over the previous 24 hours. That included an air strike in southern Beirut that the IDF said had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander. In Beirut too there was widespread anxiety. As people from the south arrived in the capital in cars with suitcases strapped to the top, some of the city's residents were themselves leaving. Israel has warned people to evacuate areas where it says Hezbollah is storing weapons - but it also sent recorded warnings to people in Beirut districts not considered Hezbollah strongholds including Hamra, an area home to government ministries, banks and universities. Parents rushed to pick up their children from school after receiving more warnings to leave the area. One father, Issa, took his son out of school, telling Reuters news agency: ""[We're here] because of the phone calls. ""They’re calling everyone and threatening people by phone. So we’re here to take my boy from school. The situation is not reassuring,"" he said. Mohammed, a Palestinian man on the road with his wife, spoke to the BBC on the way out of Beirut. When asked if he would stay in the capital he said: ""In Lebanon nowhere is safe, Israel is saying they are going to bombard everywhere. Now they threatened this neighbourhood, so where should we go?""""It’s scary, I don’t know what to do - work, go home, no idea what to do. ""Meanwhile as a BBC crew set up on one side of the road, a taxi driver called out asking if they knew of a fuel crisis unfolding. “Too many people are coming to Beirut,” he said. Schools have been hastily converted into shelters for the streams of evacuees coming from the south. On a government order, schools in Beirut and Tripoli as well as eastern Lebanon were established as shelters. The BBC was at a classroom at a public school in Bir Hasan, west Beirut on Monday which was being prepared for people coming from the Bekaa Valley - a Hezbollah stronghold in north-eastern Lebanon which Israel said it was targeting too. The classrooms were stacked with mattresses but would be fully occupied by the end of the day, workers said. Meanwhile Lebanon’s hospitals were also ordered to cancel all elective surgeries on Monday as physicians braced for a wave of casualties and injuries. Despite the tense and uncertain atmosphere in Beirut, some people were defiant. ""If a total war happens, we should stand as Lebanese people together regardless of our political affiliations because at the end of the day, our country is getting bombed,"" one man told the BBC. Others were simply resigned to the violence. ""If they want war, what can we do? It was imposed on us. We cannot do anything,"" shop owner Mohammed Sibai told Reuters. Mohammed, a 57-year-old in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieyh - Hezbollah's main power base in the capital - told the BBC he had ""survived all the wars since 1975"" so ""it's normal for me"".

2846,2024-10-01 17:22:17.299000+00:00,/news/articles/cgk7nnr0y06o,"The prime minister has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"", following a further escalation in the region as Israel accuses Iran of being behind a missile attack on Tuesday. ""The time is now, do not wait,"" he urged Britons, speaking at a press conference condemning the Iranian attack on Israel at Downing Street. ""I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink. I'm deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation,"" he said, adding that the situation is ""increasingly grave"". Britons have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website and to try and get on a UK-chartered flight from Beirut back to the Britain.  Tanks and jets on the move at Israel-Lebanon border'The country is lost': Fear and uncertainty in Lebanon as Israel invadesIsrael launches ground invasion in Lebanon Earlier on Tuesday, the foreign secretary said British nationals in Lebanon have no guarantee they will be able to leave quickly if the ""febrile and fragile"" situation deteriorates. David Lammy urged Britons to leave the country by commercial flights or on a UK-chartered plane departing on Wednesday, warning the airport in Beirut may close if the fighting continues. But Britons in Lebanon told the BBC they have received no confirmation or details about their booking on the government-chartered flight, despite paying for a seat. ""I have such a heavy heart and I'm so anxious - if I don't get on that flight, there's not really another way back for another two weeks,"" said Hanan Baba, 29. Speaking to the BBC from Tripoli, north Lebanon, Hanan said she originally planned to fly home on 5 October - before Israel hit Lebanon with a fresh wave of airstrikes and announced a ""targeted"" ground operation in the south. ""Ticket prices went through the roof - a budget airline that usually offers a one way trip to the UK at £250 is suddenly £800,"" she said. ""There's nothing else on offer now, apart from very few business class flights costing about £8,000. Or you can bribe someone to take you on a boat to Turkey or Cyprus - for thousands"". On Tuesday Lammy said he was ""seeking more capacity over the coming days"" so that people can return to the UK, but he warned he could not promise all would be swiftly returned. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants in Lebanon. Hanan has paid the requisite £350 for her seat back to the UK on the government-chartered flight, but has received ""no communication"" about the flight time or whether she has a guaranteed seat on the plane. “I feel like the government are covering their backs, deploying troops to Cyprus and saying they are negotiating day and night with flights but we have not seen any of that. They have not even communicated a plan. ""I don't even know which airline the plane is, or what time it's going to leave - and I have to actually get to the airport, which is scary enough. ""There are reports of bombs and missiles landing a five minute drive from the airport"". Other British nationals have described the ""terrifying"" journey to Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport from various locations in Lebanon. Lara, who did not want to give her surname, 19, told the BBC she had risked her own life to fly back to the UK. ""I had to convince myself that if I die it's ok - everyone dies at some point. I'd mentally convinced myself that it was ok to be killed by a rocket. ""Whenever I hear a bang, or whenever I hear something being dragged across the floor, I think it's a plane or a missile coming towards me. I shouldn't have to have that trauma - I'm 19. ""Lara, who lives in London and is in her second year of university, had been visiting family in Beirut. She made the journey back with her 84-year-old great-grandmother who had also been on holiday in the Lebanese capital. Lara said she’d received “zero communications, no help” from the UK government, and though she flew with a commercial airline, she said that it had been tough to find a flight that was direct - and affordable. “The cost is atrocious,” she said.  A British man who works for an international humanitarian organisation and wishes to remain anonymous, evacuated his home in Beirut to Mount Lebanon with his wife and child last week. They are looking for a flight out of Lebanon, but spots are booked for the next two weeks “in every which direction”, with the earliest on 16 or 17 October, and those are business class seats to Madrid or Milan costing thousands, he told the BBC. He said he heard about the chartered flight for British citizens through news reports and has not received any information or offer from the Foreign Office to buy a seat. BBC News told the Foreign Office about British nationals saying they had not received confirmation or communication about the charter flight. The Foreign Office did not comment. He added that many people are fearful and under psychological stress because “we don’t know where Israel is going to strike next”. “Everyone outside of the Bekaa Valley and the south and the suburbs of Beirut feels that the war is going to inevitably come to their doorstep,” he said. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his country is facing ""one of its most dangerous phases"", and that one million people are displaced. On Monday Israel said it had launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon, in what it has described as ""limited, localised and targeted"" raids against Hezbollah. Lebanese civilians are being warned not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani river, located 20 miles (32km) north of the Israel-Lebanon border, and residents in around 25 villages have been told to evacuate and head north. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians.

2847,2024-10-19 14:22:23.468000+00:00,/news/articles/cr54y0qplgvo,"Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injuryThere is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act. This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October. In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son. The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid. ”Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him. “Three times I tried to pull him [Abdulrahman] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it. ” His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire. Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media. There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me. ”The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday). The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas ""command and control"" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip. Hamas denies operating in hospitals. Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”. A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians. “Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields. ”The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war. People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war. Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.  But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help. In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life. The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same. “We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end. ”We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. Gazans describe fresh horror in north as Israel renews offensiveWitnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers. “We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine. ” In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza. The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother. But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings. “I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand. ""That was my brother. He was my support in this world. ” Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you. ” Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made. “We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost. ”He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet. “Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand. ” This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home"". The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die. “I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too. ” Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks:  “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent. ”Additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen and Alice Doyard","'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent","'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr54y0qplgvo,articles/article_2847.txt,results/article_2847.txt.json
2848,2024-10-10 17:32:46.795000+00:00,/news/articles/cjd58p1g515o,"Twenty-two people have been killed and 117 injured in Israeli air strikes on central Beirut on Thursday evening, Lebanon's health ministry said. BBC reporters heard loud explosions echoing from the site of the strikes in Bachoura, a small Shia area in the capital. Rescuers were seen digging through rubble at the scene. Ambulances rushed many injured to the American University hospital. Media outlets are quoting security sources as saying that Wafiq Safa - a close ally of assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the apparent intended target of the latest strikes - survived. Neither Israel's military nor Hezbollah have commented. The Israeli strikes hit residential buildings in Bachoura's two densely packed neighbourhoods, Nweiri and Basta. They came after two relatively calm days in the Lebanese capital, which has felt unusual after intensive strikes in recent weeks. There was no warning beforehand, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not commented. This is the third time Israel has launched air strikes on the city outside of the southern suburb of Dahieh, where it has struck repeatedly, killing Hezbollah commanders and destroying munitions caches. One woman outside the hospital, who did not want to be named, said she was in the building next-door to the blasts. She said a building which was hit was entirely residential, and about four or five floors high. One of her relatives was being treated for head injuries. The Beirut attack came hours after two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured in southern Lebanon when an Israeli tank fired at a watchtower, according to the UN. An observation tower at a UN base in Naqoura was directly hit, causing the peacekeepers to fall, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement. Unifil is a peacekeeping mission created in 1978, monitoring hostilities and helping to ensure humanitarian access to civilians in southern Lebanon. The UN said Israeli forces had ""repeatedly hit"" UN positions in the last 24 hours. Israeli soldiers are also accused of deliberately shooting at the cameras and lights at two other Unifil bases. The IDF said its troops had fired from the area around the base after ordering members of the base to remain in ""protected places"". Both peacekeepers were not seriously injured but remain in hospital, the UN said, adding that deliberate attacks on its peacekeepers were a ""grave violation of international law"". In a separate incident, Israeli soldiers fired at a base in Naqoura, ""hitting the entrance to the bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, and damaging vehicles and a communications system,"" the UN added. An Israeli drone was also spotted flying above the bunker entrance. Also in Naqoura, Hezbollah said it fired rockets at Israeli soldiers on the ground and used guided missiles to destroy a tank heading towards the area, leading to casualties. There are now four divisions of Israeli soldiers fighting inside Lebanon as it continues its ground operations against Hezbollah, launched on 30 September. A spokesperson for Unifil told the BBC on Thursday the force was ""alarmed"" and ""deeply concerned"" by the Israeli army's activity in the area where peacekeeping troops are based. Positions hit by Israeli forces are well known as UN sites, Andrea Tenenti said, adding it would be important to have a discussion with Israeli authorities ""to understand what happened"". Unifil has been operating in southern Lebanon, between the so-called ""Blue Line"" - the unofficial boundary separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Last week, Unifil refused to leave its positions near the Blue Line after being ordered to do so by the IDF. There are about 10,000 Unifil military peacekeepers in Lebanon, from 50 contributing countries. There are also about 800 civilian staff. Indonesia, where the injured peacekeepers are from, supplies more than 1,200 troops to Unifil, more than any other country. The defence minister in Italy, which contributes more than 1,000 troops to Unifil, said the incidents were ""intolerable"" and must be ""carefully and decisively avoided"". Around 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel by Hezbollah on Thursday, the IDF said. Earlier on Thursday, the Lebanese ministry of public health said an Israeli air strike on the village of Karak in eastern Lebanon had killed four people, injuring 17. Lebanon’s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Hostilities in the region have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. A further 251 were taken to the Gaza Strip as hostages. Since 7 October, nearly 42,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","22 killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut, Lebanon says","22 killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut, Lebanon says",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd58p1g515o,articles/article_2848.txt,results/article_2848.txt.json
2849,2024-10-01 07:28:36.905000+00:00,/news/articles/cg78j4ky5xyo,"Farai Makamba, a 27-year-old student from Zimbabwe, used to keep his university books on his desk at home in Beirut. Now they’ve been replaced by his passport, travel documents and cash. “I have a plan for myself in case I need to leave urgently,” he says. Mr Makamba, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, returned to Lebanon in September to finish the final year of his master’s degree in mechanical engineering. He spent the summer holiday at home in Harare. He came back with the hope that the conflict would de-escalate. But since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year, there has been near-daily cross-border fire between Israel and Hamas’s ally Hezbollah, the Iran-backed military group which is based in Lebanon. This last week has seen the deadliest days of conflict in Lebanon in almost 20 years. As many as one million people have been forced from their homes across Lebanon, the country's Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, has said. Israel’s military says it is carrying out a wave of “extensive” strikes in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa area, aiming to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure. The group's leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike on Friday. The week before last, 39 people were killed and thousands wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded across the country. Hezbollah blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attack. The US, UK, Australia, France, Canada and India have all issued official advice for their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. African students have told BBC News they now face a dilemma - whether to remain in Lebanon as Israel continues to attack or return home to countries such as Uganda, Zimbabwe and Cameroon. At the American University of Beirut (AUB), where Mr Makamba is studying, there are around 90 African students on a scholarship programme. Mr Makamba says there has been a “huge jump in fear” among students, especially since the pager and walkie-talkie explosions. “We don’t know who is carrying a ticking time bomb in their pockets,” he says. “Is it your taxi driver? Is it your Uber driver? Is it the person you are walking next to?” Mr Makamba's days used to be filled with classes and seeing friends. Now he says he only leaves the house to go to shop for essentials and the tension is palpable. He recently stocked up on staples such as bread, pasta and bottled water in case of shortages. The campus is closed and several of his classes have been moved online. “Everyone is nervous. Even the way we communicate is different,” he says. “When we finish class, our professor now says: 'Have a good day and stay safe. ' We say the same thing because we know what is happening in the country. ”“No-one is safe. ”Public schools have also closed and the ministry of education says they are being used to accommodate people who have fled their homes because of the Israeli airstrikes in the south of the country. The scholarship programme funding African students at AUB has given international students the option to go home and finish their course online. But some say that will not be possible. Sharon Atyang, a 27-year-old student from northern Uganda, is currently completing her master’s in community development at AUB. She says electricity and internet issues at home will make it almost impossible to complete her studies online. “I am also on a scholarship, and I don’t know if I travel home that they would bring me back here if the situation stabilises,” she says. Adele Pascaline from Cameroon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, also says completing her undergraduate radiology degree back home will be almost impossible. “I cannot do my clinical rotations back home, but I need to complete them as part of my degree,” she says. Nevertheless, the continuing attacks have meant she now has a return ticket. The Mastercard Scholarship Program finances dozens of African students in Lebanon. Mastercard Foundation said it is closely monitoring developments and working with AUB to support students. Its spokesperson said: “AUB is regularly communicating with the students and has offered support for their health and well-being. ""The academic curriculum remains flexible and necessary accommodations have been made to account for the current disruptions and to ensure academic continuity for the enrolled students. International students who wish to return home are supported to do so. ”While it is still possible to leave Beirut via the international airport, tickets are difficult to get hold of. Several airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France and Lufthansa have suspended their flights to and from the city. Ms Atyang says that from her bedroom in Beirut, she can hear the sounds of the sonic booms caused by Israeli fighter jets flying low over the city. “I was in a reading room and when I heard the sound barrier breaking, I just ran. But I had nowhere to run. I found myself hiding in the toilet,” she says. The stress of waiting for another attack has left her “emotionally and mentally unstable – [unable] to do anything”. She said many students have asked their professors to extend deadlines for assignments. Between trying to study and write her thesis, Ms Atyang is also answering frantic calls from her family in Uganda. “They are demanding that I go back home, they are telling me I need to prioritise my life over academics. ”Some African governments have begun evacuations. The Principal Secretary for Diaspora Affairs in Kenya, Roseline Njogu, confirmed that nine Kenyans had arrived back in the country in August. She urged other Kenyans who wished to leave to register for evacuation with the embassy. There are an estimated 26,000 Kenyans currently in Lebanon. Last month, the former spokesperson for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiyu Tedla,  told the BBC they were monitoring the situation closely and were “preparing plans to evacuate if necessary”. He added that there were an estimated 150,000 Ethiopians in Lebanon, the vast majority domestic workers. Some of these workers face additional challenges as they work under Lebanon’s strict kafala system, which means they must ask permission from their employers to leave. For students like Mr Makamba and Ms Atyang, getting out of Lebanon might be easier to organise. But they are held back because of their desperation to finish their studies. Both say they will make a decision in the next few days. Ms Atyang says it is particularly hard for African students. “You are on your own, and you have to take care of yourself,” she says.

2850,2024-09-30 05:15:00.855000+00:00,/news/articles/cevyx3x8dr8o,"Warning: Readers may find some of the details within this report upsetting “Higher,” the little girl demands, her eyes bright with excitement.  “Higher, higher. ”Zeina’s being pushed on a swing in a small playground in the suburbs of the northern Italian city of Padua. A normal scene anywhere in the world. But Zeina, two, can’t move her head properly. And the right side of her face, neck and scalp are marked with deep, still angry, scars. Right now, though, she’s safe and fed. And she feels like she’s flying. Zeina is one of the 5,000 people who have been allowed to leave Gaza for specialist treatment abroad since the war broke out in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on 7 October in southern Israel. The World Health Organization says more than 22,000 Gazans have suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the conflict - but very few have been allowed to leave the strip since the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was closed in May. “It was a day of nightmares,” says Zeina’s mother, Shaimaa, describing the moments leading up to her daughter’s injury as she was playing in their family's tent in al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, on 17 March. The family had already fled twice from their home in Khan Younis, first to Rafah and then to the sprawling “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi, where they thought they would be safe. Zeina and her four-year-old sister Lana had been playing together, hugging and telling each other “I love you, I love you” – Shaimaa recalls - when there was a huge air strike nearby. Zeina, terrified, ran clutching at her mother, who was holding a pot of boiling soup which spilled all over her daughter. “Her face and skin were melting in front of me,” Shaimaa says. “I picked her up and went barefoot into the street. ”Medical services were stretched, she says, but Zeina was eventually treated by Red Cross doctors at Gaza’s European hospital, where she underwent a skin graft from her father’s leg, followed by a more successful graft from the skin on her own leg after she reached Egypt. Earlier this month she was flown from Egypt to Italy to access more specialised treatment. Zeina was joined by Alaa, a 17-year-old who was severely injured in an air strike on her home in Gaza City late last year. When the two girls met, they formed a bond straight away. “I took to her immediately,” Alaa says. “She’s endured so much pain for such a small child.  I’m older and sometimes the pain was too much for me. So what about her?”Alaa was trapped for 16 hours under rubble and, when she was rescued, she discovered her father, a tailor, was dead. So too were her brothers, Nael, who was a university student, and Wael, a nurse. Their bodies have never been recovered from the ruins of their four-storey building. “I was awake the whole time under the rubble,” she tells me. “I couldn’t breathe properly because of the weight on my chest and body. I couldn’t move. I was just thinking about the rest of my family and what had happened to them. ”As well as her father and brothers, she also lost her grandparents and an aunt. She says they had nothing to do with Hamas. “I lost the people most precious to my heart,” she says. “I’m happy to be in Italy for treatment but inside I’m sad for Gaza and its people. ”In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces has denied targeting civilians and says it takes ""feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"" in its operation to dismantle Hamas military capabilities. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began nearly a year ago, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for “multiple medical evacuation corridors” for injured Palestinians. It says that only 219 patients have been allowed to leave since May. Zeina and Alaa were evacuated thanks to the persistence of a British-based charity, Save a Child, and the US-based Kinder Relief. They worked for months to get them out - petitioning Israel, Egypt and the US state department for help. “If I'm being honest, Zeina and Alaa are amongst the lucky ones who got out,” says Nadia Ali of Kinder Relief, who accompanied the girls from Egypt to Italy. “We have children who were referred to us who have died waiting to leave. ”It’s hard to speak of luck when you realise the repercussions of their injuries. Months of painful physiotherapy lie ahead for both girls, followed by many rounds of surgery. Zeina and Alaa are both under the care of one of Italy’s top burns specialists. Dr Bruno Azzena is kind and gentle with them, but he has to break to them the most brutal of news – that the burns on Alaa’s legs are so deep that she will never walk normally again. And the hair on Zeina’s scarred scalp will not grow back. Her mum, Shaimaa, is devastated. She had left Gaza hoping for a miracle. Zeina has started to realise she is different from her sisters. And, when she asks Shaimaa to tie up her hair for her, like other girls, her mother doesn’t know what to do or say. Looking after her girls alone – her husband wasn’t authorised for evacuation with them – is tough, physically and emotionally.  But Shaimaa dotes on Zeina, calling her “princess,” hiding her tears - and her fears for the future - from her. She is also grieving for her own mother who died of cancer which had spread, unchecked and untreated, through her body in the months after the war. “The war has cost me so much,” she says. “Thank God we were able to leave. We left by a miracle. I hope that other injured Palestinians can leave for treatment. I always pray for God to protect them and the war to stop. ”","After months of waiting, Gaza girls make it to Italy for burns treatment","After months of waiting, Gaza girls make it to Italy for burns treatment",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevyx3x8dr8o,articles/article_2850.txt,results/article_2850.txt.json
2851,2024-08-30 19:05:09.720000+00:00,/news/articles/crmw8rrrdw4o,"Four Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on an aid convoy in southern Gaza on Thursday, the US-based aid group Anera says. A statement said the ""community members"" were in the lead vehicle of a convoy which was carrying food and fuel to the Emirates Red Crescent hospital in Rafah from the Kerem Shalom border crossing and whose movements were co-ordinated with the Israeli military. The military said it targeted ""a number of armed assailants"" who seized control of the lead vehicle. Anera said none of its staff were harmed in the strike and that the remainder of the convoy successfully delivered the aid. In a statement published on Friday, external, Anera said the transport plan for the aid convoy to Rafah had been co-ordinated and cleared with Israeli authorities and that its agreement with transit company Move One had called for unarmed security guards. ""Shortly after departing Kerem Shalom, initial reports indicate that four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security with Move One came forward in a car and requested to take the place of the leading vehicle, citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted,"" it said. ""The four community members were neither vetted nor co-ordinated in advance, and Israeli authorities allege that the lead car was carrying numerous weapons,"" it added. ""However, the four individuals were not perceived by the convoy as a hostile threat. ""One of Anera's employees ""witnessed the incident at close range"" from the second vehicle in the convoy but was not harmed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement, which did not give a death toll, that “during the convoy’s movement, a number of armed assailants seized control of the vehicle in the front of the convoy. . . and began to lead it”. “After the takeover and further verification that a precise strike on the armed assailants’ vehicle could be carried out, a strike was conducted,"" it added. ""No damage was caused to the other vehicles in the convoy and it reached its destination. "" Anera said the Israeli strike was carried out without prior warning or communication. “According to all the information we have, this is a case of partners on the ground endeavouring to deliver aid successfully,” says Anera President and CEO Sean Carroll. “This should not come at the cost of people’s lives. ”The aid group is conducting a review of the incident. It came a day after the UN World Food Programme said it had paused the movement of its staff in the Gaza Strip ""until further notice"", after its team came under fire near an Israeli checkpoint in northern Gaza on Tuesday. A US diplomat said on Thursday that Israel had told Washington that the incident was ""a result of a communication error between IDF units"". ""We have urged them to immediately rectify the issues within their system that allowed this to happen,"" Robert Wood, the deputy US envoy to the UN, told a UN Security Council meeting. The IDF promised to improve deconfliction for aid convoys after admitting that ""grave mistakes"" had led to an air strike in April that killed seven World Central Kitchen workers. . Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Aid group says Israeli strike on Gaza convoy kills four Palestinians,Aid group says Israeli strike on Gaza convoy kills four Palestinians,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmw8rrrdw4o,articles/article_2851.txt,results/article_2851.txt.json
2852,2024-08-02 15:58:01.719000+00:00,/news/articles/c1rwr8lj9jro,"Al Jazeera has strongly rejected, external the Israeli military’s claim that its correspondent killed in an air strike in Gaza this week was a Hamas operative who participated in the 7 October attacks. Harrowing video shared on social media showed Ismail al-Ghoul’s decapitated body after he was targeted in his car in Gaza City on Wednesday. His cameraman, Rami al-Rifi, and a boy passing on a bicycle, Khalid Shawa, were also killed. While regional news this week has been dominated by other high-profile assassinations, many Palestinians have also focused on the killing of the locally prominent journalist. In a statement on Thursday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) described Ismail al-Ghoul as a “Hamas military wing operative and Nukhba terrorist” - the assertion being he was part of an elite unit in the armed group. It alleged that as part of his role he “instructed other operatives on how to record operations and was actively involved in recording and publicising attacks against IDF troops”. The IDF did not include Rami al-Rifi in its statement. Al Jazeera called the accusation against its staff member “baseless” and said it “highlights Israel’s long history of fabrications and false evidence used to cover up its heinous crimes”. Ismail's brother Jihad also told the BBC that his late sibling was strictly a civilian “portraying the suffering of the Palestinian people inside Gaza City to the outside world”. Based in Gaza City, the reporter had become a regular face on the Qatar-based TV channel, which is a popular news source in the region but has faced intense criticism from Israeli authorities. As Friday prayers in Gaza were dedicated to the late Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran, some Palestinians said they were also thinking about those who had been killed closer to home. Hamas leader Haniyeh buried in Qatar“I am truly heartbroken about Ismail [al-Ghoul],” commented Maha Sarsak, who has been displaced from Shujaiyeh to the centre of the strip. “I was keeping up on the news in the north through him on social media. We didn’t always have a TV, but we could hear his voice on the radio. ”Journalists in Gaza laid down their flak jackets at one gathering to honour al-Ghoul and al-Rifi this week. A friend of the pair said: “They hadn’t been sleeping for days nor eating. They had even lost a lot of weight. ” Ismail al-Ghoul covered Israel’s raid of Shifa Hospital in March and was arrested by the IDF at the site - but released after 12 hours without charge. Al Jazeera claimed this “debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation with any organisation”. The two Al Jazeera journalists’ last assignment had been gathering reaction to news of Haniyeh’s death. Their car was targeted close to the Hamas leader’s destroyed house in Shati Camp, an urban refugee camp. Israel has blocked international journalists from entering the Palestinian territory during the war, except on limited and highly controlled visits with the Israeli military. Prior to the closure of its Rafah border crossing with Gaza, Egypt also prevented reporters from entering. Over 10 months, many networks, including the BBC, have relied on local Palestinian staff for their on-the-ground news coverage and taken on new employees or freelancers. Al Jazeera said that Ismail al-Ghoul had been working for the channel since November. It said that he had endured “hardships” during the war including losing his father and brother. Other cameramen spoke of how al-Rifi had used his technical expertise to help them with their filming. After images of a dead Khaled al-Shawa, the boy killed in the strike, were widely publicised, the boy’s mother put out a message on social media pleading for him to be remembered too. “My son is not an unidentified martyr,” she said.  “We must say the names of our martyrs. They should not talk about us as numbers. ” Al Jazeera, which broadcasts in English and Arabic, has recently seen a series of attacks against its staff in Gaza and their families. In late October, Wael Dahdouh, the network’s well-known bureau chief, was reporting when he received word on-air that his wife, daughter, a son, and grandchild were killed in an Israeli airstrike. In December, he was injured in an attack that also killed another Al Jazeera cameraman, Samer Abudaqa. In January, a strike killed Mr Dahdouh’s son, Hamza, and Mustafa Thuria, a video stringer, while they were working for Al Jazeera. The IDF later alleged the men were “members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations"". Al Jazeera has previously fiercely denied Israel’s claims and accused it of systematically targeting its employees. The network has also condemned the decision by Israel’s government in May to ban its broadcast in the country on accusations it harms national security. Last month, the ban was extended by the Tel Aviv District Court. The United Nations has called for a full investigation and accountability for the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists and others, saying that journalists everywhere must be protected. There are differing tallies of the number of media workers killed since the unprecedented, deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel that prompted the war in Gaza. However, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, external, the latest deaths in Gaza bring the number of journalists killed to 113, including 108 Palestinians, three Lebanese and two Israelis who were killed during the 7 October assault.",Al Jazeera rebuffs Israeli claim killed journalist was Hamas operative,Al Jazeera rebuffs Israeli claim killed journalist was Hamas operative,"israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1rwr8lj9jro,articles/article_2852.txt,results/article_2852.txt.json
2853,2024-11-18 16:52:34.641000+00:00,/news/articles/c5ypjd7gepmo,"A convoy of 109 UN aid lorries carrying food was violently looted in Gaza on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says. Ninety-seven of the lorries were lost and their drivers were forced at gunpoint to unload their aid after passing through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, in what is believed to have been one of the worst incidents of its kind. Eyewitnesses said the convoy was attacked by masked men who threw grenades. Unrwa commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini did not identify the perpetrators, but he said the “total breakdown of civil order” in Gaza meant it had “become an impossible environment to operate in”. Without immediate intervention, severe food shortages are set to worsen for the two million people depending on humanitarian aid to survive, according to Unrwa. A UN-backed assessment warned earlier this month that there was “strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip”, external. It came after Israeli forces launched a major ground offensive in the north and the UN said fewer aid lorries had entered Gaza last month than at any time since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023. Saturday’s looting was first reported by Reuters news agency, which cited an Unrwa official in Gaza as saying that the convoy was instructed by Israeli authorities to ""depart at short notice via an unfamiliar route"" from Kerem Shalom. Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said its security staff killed ""more than 20 members of gangs involved in stealing aid trucks"" in an operation carried out in cooperation with ""tribal committees"", a network of traditional family clans. Lazzarini said he could not comment on the route when asked at a news conference in Geneva on Monday, but he confirmed the looting and said: “We have been warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order. ”“Until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy. This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south. It has become an impossible environment to operate in. ”He added that hundreds of people desperate for food had tried to storm the Unrwa-run vocational centre in the southern city of Khan Younis because they thought the aid had been delivered there. “But the convoys were looted and there was absolutely nothing to take from the warehouses. ”Unrwa put out a separate statement on X that accused Israeli authorities of continuing to “disregard their legal obligations under international law to ensure the population's basic needs are met and to facilitate the safe delivery of aid”. “Such responsibilities continue when trucks enter the Gaza Strip, until people are reached with essential assistance. ”There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.  Earlier, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in the Gaza Strip, Cogat, said on X: “With the challenges the UN aid organisations experience in distributing aid, we are working together on various measures that will facilitate the transfer of aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gazans in need. ”“For months now, aid has been piling up on the Gazan side, after Israeli inspection, waiting for collection and distribution, and we've been taking many measures to assist with the pick-up of aid,” it added. Israel has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group has denied. Last week, a group of 29 non-governmental organisations said in a report that the looting of aid convoys was “a consequence of Israel's targeting of the remaining police forces in Gaza, scarcity of essential goods, lack of routes and closure of most crossing points, and the subsequent desperation of the population amid these dire conditions”. They cited media reports as saying that “many incidents are taking place close by or in full view of Israeli forces, without them intervening, even when truck drivers asked for assistance”. Also on Monday, Palestinian authorities said Israeli strikes had killed more than 30 people across Gaza. At least 17 were reportedly killed when a house was hit near Kamal Adwan hospital in the Beit Lahia Project, in northern Gaza. The director of Gaza's health ministry cited Kamal Adwan’s director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, as saying that the dead were members of the family of one of the hospital’s medics, Dr Hani Badran. A video purportedly showed Dr Badran being comforted on a ward, external. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency meanwhile said its first responders had recovered the bodies of seven people from a home that was struck in the north-west of Gaza City. Another four people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent inside the Israeli-designated al-Mawasi humanitarian area, in southern Gaza, it added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.","Almost 100 Gaza food aid lorries violently looted, UN agency says","Almost 100 Gaza food aid lorries violently looted, UN agency says","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypjd7gepmo,articles/article_2853.txt,results/article_2853.txt.json
2854,2024-12-05 14:10:49.108000+00:00,/news/articles/cjwl0v4w5j3o,"Amnesty International has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza war, which Israel strongly denies. The UK-based human rights group said its conclusion was based on “dehumanising and genocidal statements” by Israeli officials, digital images and witness testimony and must serve as “a wake-up call” to the international community. Israel’s foreign ministry described the 295-page report, external as “entirely false and based on lies”, while the Israeli military said the claims were “entirely baseless and fail to account for the operational realities” it faces. In the past day, meanwhile, local medics say at least 50 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza. The biggest number of people were killed in the al-Mawasi tent camp for displaced people, where Israel says it was targeting Hamas operatives. Amnesty says that its research over months “has found sufficient basis to conclude that Israel has committed - and is continuing to commit - genocide against Palestinians”. The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted following the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said Israeli actions “include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction"". “Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,” she continued. The report by the global campaign group comes as the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice at The Hague, continues to examine allegations by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Israel has called the case ""wholly unfounded"" and based on ""biased and false claims"". Responding to the allegations by Amnesty, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, described the human rights group as a “deplorable and fanatical organisation”. “The genocidal massacre on 7 October 2023, was carried out by the Hamas terrorist organisation against Israeli citizens,” he stated, adding that Israel as acting in self-defence and “fully in accordance with international law"". The Israeli military said it was “actively working to dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure” in Gaza and that it “takes all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians during operations"". About 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the Hamas-led attacks 15 months ago, which triggered the Gaza war. Since then, at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN. In the past day, Israel has continued to carry out attacks across the length of the Palestinian territory. At least 23 people were killed and many more wounded in an air strike on a camp for displaced people in al-Mawasi in Khan Younis. Social media video shows residents battling fires overnight. At the nearby Nasser Hospital, a local BBC cameraman filmed the arrival of the wounded, including blood-stained children and a disabled man. The bodies of two small children were among the dead brought wrapped up in blankets. Israel’s military said its attack targeted senior Hamas operatives acting in what it considers a humanitarian zone. “Following the strike, secondary explosions were identified, suggesting the presence of weaponry in the area,” it said in a statement. It said it had taken steps “to mitigate the risk of harming civilians” and accused Hamas of using civilians “as human shields for terrorist activity"". On Thursday, BBC footage showed people picking through the mangled wrecks of shacks and piles of ash. “The strike hit us without any warning and did this big massacre,” Mohammed Abu Shahli said. “The people here are refugees from different places - from Rafah and the north. They came to a place they thought was safe. ”His head bandaged, Abdul Rahman Jamaa said seven members of his family were killed including his father and three brothers. He told the BBC: “There are no protected safe areas as the Israelis say. These are all lies.

2855,2024-11-16 00:34:48.444000+00:00,/news/articles/c30p1jmzjrzo,"A fragile calm hangs over the Dutch capital, still reeling from the unrest that erupted a week ago when Israeli football fans came under attack in the centre of Amsterdam. City officials described the violence as a ""toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger” over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. As the streets are cleared of Maccabi Ultras stickers and tensions linger, there is concern about the damage done to relations between Amsterdam’s Jewish and Muslim communities. The tensions have spilled over into Dutch politics too. The Netherlands' coalition government has been left hanging by a thread after a Moroccan-born junior minister resigned because of language used by coalition colleagues. Amsterdam had already seen protests and tensions because of the war in the Middle East, and local Rabbi Lody van de Kamp believes it was like a tinderbox: ""If you put 2,000 [Israeli] football supporters on to the streets, you know you are in trouble. ” Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had arrived in the city for a Europa League match against Ajax and footage was widely shared the night before showing a group of fans climbing up a wall to tear down and burn a Palestinian flag. An Amsterdam council report said taxis were also attacked and vandalised. Emine Uğur, a well-known columnist in the Muslim community, says underlying tensions surrounding the war in Gaza meant that the ensuing violence was ""a long time coming"". She speaks of a lack of acknowledgement of the pain felt by communities affected by a conflict that had left many without an outlet for their grief and frustration. The flag-burning incident as well as anti-Arab chants were seen as a deliberate provocation. But then messages calling for retaliation appeared on social media, some using chilling terms such as ""Jew hunt"". On the evening of the match, a pro-Palestinian protest was moved away from the Johan Cruyff arena, but it was in the hours afterwards that the violence erupted. The 12-page report by Amsterdam’s authorities describes some Maccabi supporters “committing acts of vandalism” in the centre. Then it highlights “small groups of rioters… engaged in violent hit-and-run actions targeting Israeli supporters and nightlife crowd” in locations across the city centre. They moved “on foot, by scooter, or car… committing severe assaults”. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described the incidents as deeply alarming, and noted for some they were a reminder of historical pogroms against Jews. For a few hours, swathes of the Jewish community in a European capital felt as though they were under siege. These events coincided with the anniversary of the Nazi pogroms on Jews in 1938, also known as Kristallnacht. That only intensified the fears of Amsterdam's Jewish community, although local imams and other members of the Muslim community took part in the commemorations. Senior members, including Esther Voet, editor of the Dutch Jewish Weekly, organised emergency shelters and coordinated rescue efforts for those fearing for their lives. The Dutch government has responded by allocating €4.5m (£3.6m) to combat antisemitism and support victims. Justice Minister David van Weel emphasised that Jewish people must feel safe in their own country and promised to deal severely with perpetrators. However, the chairman of the Central Jewish Committee, Chanan Hertzberger, warned that these measures alone might not suffice. He blamed in part an atmosphere where “antisemitic rhetoric has gone unchecked since 7 October"", adding: ""Our history teaches us that when people say they want to kill you, they mean it, and they will try. ""The violence and its aftermath have also exposed political rifts, and some of the language from politicians has shocked the Netherlands’ Moroccan community. Geert Wilders, whose far-right Freedom Party is the biggest of the four parties that make up the Dutch coalition government, has called for the deportation of dual nationals guilty of antisemitism. Both he and coalition partner Caroline van der Plas, among others, have pointed the finger at young people of Moroccan or North African descent. One Dutch-Moroccan commentator, Hassnae Bouazza, complained that her community had for years been accused of not being integrated, and was now being threatened with having their Dutch nationality taken away. Nadia Bouras, a Dutch historian of Moroccan descent, told Amsterdam’s Het Parool newspaper that using the term “integration” for people who had already lived in the Netherlands for four generations was like “holding them hostage”. “You are holding them in a constant state of being foreign, even though they are not. ”The junior minister for benefits, Nora Achahbar, who was born in Morocco but grew up in the Netherlands, said on Friday she was standing down from the government because of racist language she had heard during a cabinet meeting on Monday, three days after the violence in Amsterdam. She may not be the last. Rabbi van de Kamp has told the BBC he is concerned that antisemitism is being politicised to further Islamophobic agendas. He warns against repeating the exclusionary attitudes reminiscent of the 1930s, cautioning that such rhetoric not only endangers Jewish communities but deepens suspicions within society: ""We must show that we cannot be made into enemies. ”The impact on Amsterdam's Muslim and Jewish residents is profound. Many Jews have removed mezuzahs - the small Torah scrolls - from their doorposts, or they have covered them with duct tape out of fear of reprisal. Esther Voet sees the emotional toll on her community: ""It’s an exaggeration to say that the Netherlands now is like the 1930s, but we must pay attention and speak out when we see something that’s not right. ""Muslims, meanwhile, argue they are being blamed for the actions of a small minority, before the perpetrators have even been identified. Columnist Emine Uğur has herself faced increased threats as a vocal Muslim woman: ""People feel emboldened. ""She fears for her son's future in a polarised society where the lines of division seem to be hardening. Academics and community leaders have called for de-escalation and mutual understanding. Bart Wallet, a professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Amsterdam, stresses the need for careful terminology, warning against equating the recent violence with pogroms of the past. Like others, he hopes the violence was an isolated incident rather than a sign of worsening ethnic polarisation. Mayor Femke Halsema is adamant that antisemitism should not be followed by other forms of racism, emphasising that the safety of one group must not come at the expense of another. The violence has left Amsterdam questioning its identity as a diverse and tolerant city. There is a collective recognition, in the Dutch capital and beyond, that as residents seek to rebuild trust, they must address the tensions that fuelled such unrest. Rubbing his hands against the cold, as Amsterdam's cyclists stream by, Rabbi van de Kamp recalls his mother's words: ""We are allowed to be very angry, but we must never hate.

2856,2024-11-26 20:18:55.136000+00:00,/news/articles/cj3m4n4lmrko,"Benjamin Netanyahu presented the ceasefire deal in the context of what he said were Israel’s “unprecedented achievements” over the past year of a seven-front war. He said Israel had set Hezbollah back “tens of years” and that it was not the same group it had been before. There was a lot of focus on Israel’s strength in doing what it believed needed to be done - in Gaza, in Lebanon and elsewhere - despite international opposition. And there was a lot of justification for the ceasefire too - it would allow Israel to “concentrate on the Iranian threat”, Netanyahu said, emphasising that his country would retain full military freedom to counter any new Hezbollah threat. Israel’s army said on Tuesday it had hit 180 targets in Lebanon in the past 24 hours.  Here on the Israeli side of the border, there have been constant warnings of rocket barrages and drone attacks from Lebanon. Neither side wants this ceasefire deal to be seen as surrender. Follow live updates from Israel and Lebanon What we know about the ceasefire dealQuestions over Hezbollah's futureWatch: People in Israel and Lebanon react But surrender is exactly what Netanyahu is being accused of by his political rivals - and some of his political allies too. One poll yesterday suggested that more than 80% of Netanyahu’s support base opposed a deal, and residents in the north of Israel - large numbers of whom have been evacuated from their homes - are angry too. Nationally, the picture was more split, however. One poll showed 37% of Israelis in favour of the ceasefire, 32% against and 31% saying they didn't know. Shelly, an English teacher in Shlomi, said a ceasefire was an “irresponsible and hasty political decision”. Rona Valency, evacuated from kibbutz Kfar Giladi on 8 October last year, told me she wanted to go home, and that a ceasefire was needed, but that the idea of Lebanese residents returning to these villages gave her “a real sense of unease and fright”. From Kfar Giladi there are clear views of the Lebanese village of Odaisseh just across the valley. “The only thing I can hope for is that Hezbollah will not infiltrate these villages and build a new network,” Rona told me.  “Apart from completely erasing these villages, and having no people there, there is no real physical thing that can make me feel safe. It’s just, you know, hope. ”Her husband, Onn, said the key to security lay, not in the terms of the ceasefire agreement, but in people “understand[ing] again, where we live; understand[ing] some things that a lot of us forgot”. He said he didn’t trust the Lebanese army, nor the Americans, to restore security along the border. “I trust only our army,” he said. “I think if the army won’t be there, it will be very, very hard to get the citizens back. ” This war has delivered a lot of military achievements for Israel - Hezbollah is weakened, its arsenals and infrastructure depleted, and its solidarity with Hamas broken. But Israel’s armed forces are tired, its economy is suffering, and tens of thousands of its residents are displaced. Still, many here are urging Benjamin Netanyahu to continue the war in Lebanon - asking why the prime minister who has vowed to continue fighting in Gaza until “total victory” is signing a ceasefire in the north?",Anger and distrust among displaced Israelis at ceasefire deal,Anger and distrust among displaced Israelis at ceasefire deal,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3m4n4lmrko,articles/article_2856.txt,results/article_2856.txt.json
2857,2024-10-05 16:58:57.791000+00:00,/news/articles/cp394rx53qro,"Conversations in Tyre in southern Lebanon happen in a hurry now.  It’s not wise to linger on the streets, and there are fewer and fewer people to talk to. Chats can be cut short by the rumble of Israeli bombing, or the sound of outgoing rocket fire by Hezbollah – which can attract incoming fire. Israeli drones buzz overhead. You drive fast, but don’t speed, knowing there are eyes in the sky. Mostly you are the only car on an empty road – which can make you a target. That knowledge is always with us, like the body armour we now wear. But civilians here have no armour plating to shield them, and many Lebanese no longer have a roof over their heads. More than one million have been forced to flee, according to the Prime Minister, Najib Mikati. War has created a vacuum here – sucking the life out of this ancient city proud of its Roman ruins, and golden sandy beach. Streets are empty, and shops shuttered. The seashore is deserted. Windows rattle with Israeli air strikes. The local civil defence headquarters lies abandoned – rescue teams were forced to evacuate – to save themselves after they got a telephone warning from Israel. Israeli strikes are getting louder and closer to our hotel – in recent days several strikes on the hills opposite us appear to involve some of Israel’s most destructive bombs, weighing in at 1000lb. And then there is the Hezbollah factor. Even as the armed group is trying to hold off invading Israeli troops on Lebanese soil, it is controlling the international media in the city of Tyre. It limits our movements, though it has no control over what we write or broadcast. In hospitals, doctors look weary and overwhelmed. Many no longer go home because it is too dangerous to travel. Instead, they tend to patients like nine-year-old Mariam, whose left leg is in a cast, and whose arm is heavily bandaged. She lies sleeping in a bed in Hiram Hospital, dark hair framing her face. “She came in as part of a family of nine,” said Dr Salman Aidibi, the hospital CEO.  “Five of them were also treated. We operated on Mariam, and she is doing much better. We hope to send her home today. Most casualties are given first aid here and stabilised before being sent to other centres, because this hospital is on the front line. ”He says the hospital receives about 30-35 injured women and children a day, and it is taking its toll on staff. “We need to be positive while we’re working,” he said. “It’s when we stop and contemplate, remember, that’s when we get emotional. ”Asked about what may lie ahead his response comes with a sigh. “We are in a war,” he says. “A destructive war on Lebanon. We hope for peace, but we are prepared for all eventualities. ”Also prepared for the worst is Hassan Manna. He’s staying put in Tyre as war tightens its grip. And he is staying open for business at the small coffee shop he has run for the past 14 years. Locals still pass by for a chat and some reassurance in the form of small plastic cups of sweet coffee. “I'm not leaving my country,” Hassan told me. “I'm not leaving my house. I’m staying in my place, with my children. I’m not afraid of them (the Israelis). ""The whole world is out on the streets. We don’t want to be humiliated like that. ""Let me die in my house. ”Five of his neighbours were killed in their home by an Israeli air strike last weekend. Hassan saw it happen and was thrown in the air by two incoming Israeli missiles. He managed to walk away with just an injured arm. Was there a Hezbollah target there? We don’t know. Hassan says the dead were all civilians and members of one family, including two women and a baby. Israel says its targets are Hezbollah fighters and their facilities, and not the people of Lebanon. Many here say otherwise – including doctors, and witnesses like Hassan. Israel says it is taking steps to minimise the risk of harming civilians – accusing Hezbollah of hiding its infrastructure among civilian populations. “There was nothing (no weapons) there,” Hassan insisted. “If there was, we would have left the area. There was nothing to be bombed. The woman was 75. ”After the strike he dug in the rubble for survivors until he collapsed and was taken to hospital himself. When he speaks of his neighbours his voice breaks with anger and grief - and his eyes fill with tears. “It’s unjust,” he said, “totally unjust. We know the people. They were born here. I swear I wish I had died with them. ” Ten days ago, we got the view in a Christian area, close to the border. One local woman – who asked not to be named - told me everyone was living on their nerves. “The phone is constantly beeping,” she said. “We can never know when (Israeli) attacks are coming. It’s always tense. Many nights we can’t sleep. ”We were interrupted by the sound of an Israeli air strike, which sent smoke rising from distant hills. She reeled off a list of villages nearer the border - now deserted and destroyed after the past year of tit for tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel. She said the damage in these areas was already far greater than in the five-week war of 2006. “If people want to come back later"", she said, “there are no houses left to come back to.  ""And there is no house that did not lose relatives,” she said, “either close or distant. All the men are Hezbollah. ”Before the war the armed group was always “bragging about its weapons, and saying it would fight Israel forever,” she told me. “Privately, even their followers are now shocked at the quality and quantity of attacks by Israel. ”Few here would dare to guess at the future. “We have entered a tunnel,” she said, “and until now we cannot see the light. ""From Tel Aviv, to Tehran, to Washington no one can be sure what is coming next, and what the Middle East will look like the day after.

2858,2024-08-14 14:49:14.767000+00:00,/news/articles/clyn63rq8n2o,"It's a social media photo that has gone down badly with many in SNP circles. External Affairs Secretary, Angus Robertson, standing alongside Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela GrudskyIn a social media post, Ms Grudsky said they had discussed the release of Israeli hostages and that Israel was “looking forward to cooperating” with Scotland in areas including culture and renewables. Many SNP figures are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East, and this diplomatic encounter prompted an internal backlash. But Scotland's First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting with an Israeli government representative. Mr Robertson met Ms Grudsky on the 8 August, but it was four days later that the Scottish government released a statement about it. A spokesperson made reference to areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel. The Gaza conflict was addressed in this press release, but not in as strong terms as we’ve heard Scottish government ministers use in the recent past. It outlined that Angus Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides in Gaza. ”And the statement went on to explain that the External Affairs Secretary had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza. ”But there was no specific mention, for example, of civilian deaths in Gaza or of weapons sales to Israel. There’s criticism of both the meeting itself and the tone of announcements made in its wake. Emma Roddick was an SNP Government minister until earlier this year. Before John Swinney posted his justification for the meeting, she told me that she wanted more information about how it came about. The Highland MSP said her “heart just sank” when she saw the photo on social media, adding that she was not comfortable with the engagement. In private, some SNP insiders have expressed their anger in much stronger terms. One MSP told me that Angus Robertson was “an absolute disgrace” for taking part in the meeting, and that he should be sacked from his role as External Affairs Secretary. This simply wasn’t robust enough for a number of SNP figures, who have now gone public with their criticism. The former minister Kevin Stewart branded the meeting a mistake. The Aberdeen Central MSP posted on social media, external: “I hope Angus Robertson also demanded an immediate ceasefire, castigated the IDF for bombing hospitals and schools and told you that Israel should comply with all of the UN Resolutions that have been passed over decades”. That was reposted by Ivan McKee, a serving Scottish Government minister. Another former SNP minister, Elena Whitham, shared the original photo with a sad emoji face posted alongside it. John Swinney posted a statement online, external earlier, acknowledging that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”. But he stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. The First Minister explained that he saw it as an opportunity to convey the Scottish Government’s “consistent position on the killing and suffering of innocent civilians in the region. ”It may be the case that Angus Robertson raised this with the Israeli deputy ambassador in private. But it’s not something that was touched upon in detail in the statement the Scottish Government published after the meeting. It’s not the first time that Mr Robertson has prompted a backlash over engagements with foreign officials. Last year he faced criticism after some felt he should have taken a firmer position on China. Unlike in other parties – such as Labour – the conflict in the Middle-East hasn’t sparked division in the SNP. But this diplomatic encounter has prompted real anger in the party. A big part of diplomacy is striking the right tone. But many within the SNP think that the Scottish Government has been tone deaf when it comes to this engagement with Israel. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy told BBC Scotland News: ""As part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK, it is the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations, including with the Scottish Government, through partnerships and frank dialogue. ""It is unfortunate that the core principles of diplomacy are being called into question. ""We remain resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel, including through advocating for the return of our 115 Israeli hostages who continue to be held by Hamas in Gaza.

2860,2024-10-06 22:32:27.011000+00:00,/news/articles/c9wkxv9d99vo,"Reports of antisemitic incidents in the US have reached a record high since last year's Hamas attack in Israel, according to a preliminary report from the Anti-Defamation League Center for Extremism (ADL). The group found more than 10,000 incidents from 7 October 2023 to 24 September of this year, more than a 200% increase compared to the same period a year earlier. It is the highest ever since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979. The report comes just days after the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement warning of possible violent threats amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East.  Since last October’s Hamas attack on Israel which saw around 1,200 people killed ""Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere. ”The more than 10,000 episodes of antisemitism reported by the ADL included roughly 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment, 1,840 incidents of vandalism and 150 incidents of physical assault. The states with the highest number of recorded cases in the report were California, with 1,266 incidents, New York with 1,218, New Jersey with 830, and Florida with 463. The ADL said that it expected its preliminary numbers to increase as it receives more data. The final report for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025. Part of the overall increase comes from a change in methodology to include ""expressions of opposition to Zionism, as well as support for resistance against Israel or Zionists that could be perceived as supporting terrorism"", the ADL said. The ADL's preliminary report tallied more than 3,000 of incidents that took place during anti-Israel rallies ""which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups"", including Hamas and Hezbollah. Excluding these incidents, the ADL counted 7,523 episodes of antisemitism, a 103% increase from 2022. Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a massive military operation in the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas. Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The war inspired a wave of demonstrations across the US, particularly at college campuses, with many protesting against the growing humanitarian toll. In Lebanon, more than 1,000 people have been killed while up to a million people may have been displaced since Israel launched its attack against Iran-backed Hezbollah.

2861,2024-11-21 12:13:27.614000+00:00,/news/articles/cly2exvx944o,"Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and former defence minister, as well as the military commander of Hamas. A statement said a pre-trial chamber had rejected Israel’s challenges to the court’s jurisdiction and issued warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. A warrant was also issued for Mohammed Deif of Hamas, although Israel has said he was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. The judges said there were “reasonable grounds” the three men bore ""criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Both Israel and Hamas have rejected the allegations. Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the ICC’s decision as “antisemitic”, while Hamas said the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant had set an ""important historical precedent"". The impact of these warrants will in part depend on whether the ICC’s 124 member states - which do not include Israel or its main ally, the United States - decide to enforce them or not. The White House said the US rejected the ICC decision. However, several European countries have said they respect the decisions of the court. The ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty. Israel rejects the ICC's jurisdiction, but the court ruled in 2021 that it had jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza because the UN’s secretary general had accepted the Palestinians were a member. In May, the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan sought warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, Deif and two other Hamas leaders who have since been killed, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar. Although Israel believes Deif is dead, the chamber said it had been notified by the ICC prosecution that it was not in a position to determine whether he was killed or remained alive. The prosecutor's case against them stems from the events of 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign to eliminate Hamas, during which at least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. For Deif, external, the chamber found reasonable grounds to believe he was ""responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence"". It also said there were reasonable grounds to believe the crimes against humanity were ""part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel"". For Netanyahu and Gallant, external, who was replaced as defence minister earlier this month, the chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that they ""each bear criminal responsibility for the following crimes as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts"". It also found reasonable grounds to believe that ""each bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population"". The chamber also noted that it had rejected two Israeli challenges - one disputing the ICC’s jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories, and Israeli nationals specifically, and the other arguing that the ICC prosecutor had not given Israel the opportunity to investigate the allegations itself before requesting warrants. The ICC is a court of last resort and is only supposed to act when domestic courts cannot, or will not, genuinely investigate or prosecute serious international crimes. Despite the warrants, Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate threat of prosecution, although it could make it difficult for them to travel abroad. Technically, if either of them set foot in any ICC member state they must be arrested and handed over to the court. Netanyahu’s most recent overseas trip was in July to the US, which is not a member. But last year, he visited several other countries, including the UK, which is. When asked by journalists if Netanyahu would be arrested if he came to the UK, the government spokesman replied: “We are not getting into hypotheticals. ”It is believed a domestic legal process would be required in the UK to determine whether to endorse the warrant. Two EU countries - Italy and the Netherlands - have said openly they would arrest any of the men on their territory. Several other European countries promised to comply with the ICC's rules without specifying this. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the ICC decision was binding on all EU member states. ICC members do not always choose to enforce warrants. Russian President Vladimir Putin, wanted over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, received a warm welcome and was not arrested during an official visit to neighbouring Mongolia - an ICC member - in September. South Africa, another ICC member, also failed to arrest then-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited in 2015 despite him facing a warrant for alleged war crimes in the Darfur region. In the US, incoming Senate Republican leader John Thune urged the Senate to pass a bill that has already been passed by the House of Representatives, under which the US would impose sanctions on people ""engaged in any effort to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies”. Netanyahu said in a video that it was a ""dark day in the history of humanity"", and that the ICC has become ""the enemy of humanity. ""It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,"" he said. Gallant said the court’s decision “places the State of Israel and the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimises the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds”. Hamas made no mention of the warrant for Deif but welcomed the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying the ICC's decision “constitutes an important historical precedent, and a correction to a long path of historical injustice against our people”. Israel has vehemently denied the allegation its forces are committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which is the subject of a separate case before the International Court of Justice. The Palestinian Authority - which runs parts of the West Bank - said the decision “represents hope and confidence in international law and its institutions” and urged ICC member states to halt “contact and meetings” with Netanyahu and Gallant. Palestinians in Gaza expressed hope that it would bring Israeli leaders to justice. “The court’s decision may ease some of my pain, but my sister’s soul - and those of tens of thousands of Palestinian victims - will not find peace until Netanyahu and his army leaders are behind bars,” Munira al-Shami, whose sister Wafa was killed in an Israeli attack a month ago, told the BBC.

2863,2024-08-28 04:58:02.981000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2ny546m7go,"At least 10 Palestinians have been killed in a major operation by Israeli forces in the north of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says. Israeli security forces said they had begun ""a counterterrorism operation” in Jenin and Tulkarm overnight and that they had so far killed “five armed terrorists from the air and ground”. It also said another four were killed in an air strike during a simultaneous operation in al-Faraa refugee camp near Tubas. A further death was reported west of Jenin. Local journalists said they had not seen anything of this scope and scale in the West Bank since the days of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, two decades ago. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. Israeli media reported that hundreds of Israeli forces were active in four different cities at least in the north of the West Bank – Jenin, Tulkarm, Tubas and Nablus. The Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank said on Wednesday morning the bodies of seven people had been brought to Tubas governmental hospital and that two others had arrived at Jenin governmental hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent also reported that at least nine people had been killed across the West Bank, revising down its death toll to 10.  It said they included three who were killed in a drone strike in Misilya, a village near Jenin, and four others who were killed in a drone strike in al-Faraa refugee camp, near Tubas. However, the true figure could be higher, with the governor of Jenin earlier saying that at least 11 people had been killed. In Jenin - a regular flashpoint - troops blocked all but one of the entrances to the city and set up checkpoints. The health ministry said Israeli forces had also surrounded Jenin government hospital and the nearby Ibn Sina hospital, as well as the headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent and the Friends of the Patients society. It warned that they were threatening to storm the hospitals and that doing so would threaten the lives of dozens of patients inside as well as medical staff. ""At this moment, there are patients that are leaving the hospital but after the IDF check their IDs,"" a local journalist inside the government hospital told the BBC. ""It's a scary situation. ""The health ministry also accused them of obstructing the work of ambulances, which it said was a violation of international law. The troops have also been searching Jenin refugee camp, which is a base for armed groups and has been the scene of many fierce gun battles in the past. A resident of the camp told the BBC that he could hear explosions nearby and the buzzing of drones overhead, but that there was currently no sign of armed fighters taking on Israeli forces. He said Israeli armoured bulldozers had destroyed the main street through the camp and piled rubble at the entrance to block access. “In the area of Jenin, three armed terrorists who posed a threat to the security forces were eliminated in an aerial strike,” said a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Shin Bet domestic security agency and Israel Border Police. “Furthermore, in the areas of Jenin and Tulkarm, the forces eliminated two additional armed terrorists, apprehended wanted suspects, and located and confiscated weapons including M-16s, ammunition, and additional military equipment. ”They also said forces had exposed and dismantled explosives that had been planted under local roads to attack them. Hamas later put out a statement mourning six men who it said were fighters killed by Israeli forces in Jenin on Wednesday. During a simultaneous operation in al-Faraa refugee camp, near Tubas, “an aircraft struck and eliminated four armed terrorists that posed a threat to the forces”, while forces on the ground confiscated weapons, they added. Masoud Naaja said two of his adult sons were killed in the strike, which he said took place as he gave water to some men who had asked for a drink near his home. ""In seconds, very fast, we felt like something came down on us from the sky and there was an explosion,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""When I put my hand on my chest, it was full of shrapnel and blood. ""“I entered the house to find it all damaged from inside,” he added. “My wife asked me what happened and I told her and asked her to go check on our children on the rooftop. She found three of our children - two, may they rest in peace, and one was injured. ”A woman in Tubas told the BBC that Israeli forces were “bringing more and more military vehicles and bulldozers” into al-Faraa refugee camp. “We are all on edge and waiting to see if there will be any escalation,"" she said. IDF spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the forces were targeting ""a mixture of terror groups and terror cells"", and declined to say how long the operation would last or how many troops were involved. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz put out a strongly worded statement saying the military was acting with “full force” in Jenin and Tulkarm, aiming to “dismantle Iranian-Islamic terror infrastructures established there”. He accused Iran, which backs Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, of trying to “establish an eastern terror front” by funding and smuggling advanced weapons from Jordan. Mr Katz said the threat must be addressed with the same determination of the threat from Gaza. including “temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents” - something we have not heard in an official capacity before. A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas warned that the escalating Israeli raids in the West Bank, alongside the Gaza war, would “lead to dire and dangerous results for which everyone will pay the price”. Nabil Abu Rudeineh called for urgent international action to “curb this extremist [Israeli] government that poses a threat to the stability of the region and the entire world”. Hamas - which is a bitter rival of Mr Abbas’s Fatah movement - condemned the Israeli operation, calling it part of the “brutal genocidal war in Gaza”. A spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office also said such an operation ""risks seriously deepening the already catastrophic situation"", and that the use of air strikes and other military weapons and tactics by Israeli security forces ""violates human rights norms and standards applicable to law enforcement operations"". The UN said 622 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - had been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between 7 October and Monday. At least 602 were killed by Israeli forces, including 126 in air strikes, and 11 by Israeli settlers, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine members of Israeli forces and five settlers, were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during the same period, while 10 Israelis were killed in Israel in attacks by Palestinians from the West Bank. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",At least 10 Palestinians killed in Israeli raids in West Bank,At least 10 Palestinians killed in Israeli raids in West Bank,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2ny546m7go,articles/article_2863.txt,results/article_2863.txt.json

More than 85 people were said to be injured, some seriously, as homes belonging to three families in the camp were hit. A video circulating on social media - which the BBC has not verified - appears to show bodies wrapped in white shrouds laid out in the courtyard of al-Awda Hospital. Israeli forces have besieged the densely-populated Jabalia refugee camp for weeks. The director of al-Awda hospital said it had experienced an overwhelming influx of casualties, leaving hospital wards ""completely full"" with many of the injured ""receiving treatment on the floor. ”Nearby in Beit Lahia, the Indonesian Hospital came under “heavy gunfire” from Israeli forces on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said. The ministry said more than 40 patients, as well as medical staff, were inside the hospital, and later said two people had died due to an ""outage of electricity"" and lack of ""medical supplies"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops were operating near the hospital and there ""was no intentional fire directed at it"". Local sources indicate that northern Gaza is effectively isolated, with telecommunications and internet services severed in the region. About 400,000 people have been trapped inside Jabalia camp with little food or water for more than two weeks. The head of the UN's Office for Humanitarian Assistance, Georgios Petropoulos, told the BBC's Newshour programme that families in Jabalia were enduring ""atrocious conditions"". ""We can't hit the alarm bell hard enough about how dire and dangerous the situation for civilians there is,"" he said, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza. Israel said it had sent about 30 lorries of supplies into northern Gaza on Friday including food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment but local health officials told Reuters aid had not been reaching the worst-affected areas such as Jabalia. Israel has repeatedly denied it is preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza but the US has told it to boost access or risk having some American military assistance cut off. An Israeli minister, Amichai Chikli, told the BBC Israel had ""blockaded"" parts of northern Gaza, which include Jabalia. ""We allowed the civilian population to escape into the safe zone, and we prevented supplies to enter the blockade region,"" he told the Newshour programme. He insisted this was ""legal according to the international law"". Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was confirmed to have been killed in Gaza on Thursday. According to the Israeli military, he died in a firefight after the building where he was hiding in the southern Gaza city of Rafah was struck with ""tank fire"". The pathologist in Israel who conducted his autopsy told US media he had been shot in the head. Dr Chen Kugel also found injuries to his right forearm from ""missile fire"", a damaged left leg from ""fallen masonry"" and shrapnel injuries. His death raised some hopes in some quarters for an end to the war, but the group's deputy leader said Hamas would only be strengthened. US President Joe Biden has said there is a chance of ""working towards a ceasefire” in Lebanon, where Israel is fighting Hezbollah militants, but it will be ""harder in Gaza”. He was speaking as he left the German capital Berlin, where he had met German, French and British leaders. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday the death of Hamas leader Sinwar will not halt the ""Axis of Resistance"" - the regional network of Iran-backed, heavily armed militias that oppose Israel. ""Hamas is alive and will remain alive,"" Khamenei's statement added. On Friday, Hamas deputy leader Khalil al-Hayya said Israeli hostages would not be returned until Israel ended the war and withdrew from Gaza. The war in Gaza began after Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 left around 1,200 people dead, with 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas in response, and since then at least 42,500 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured in Gaza, the Hamas-run authorities say.

On Friday, fighting also continued in Lebanon, where Israel has been conducting a ground invasion against Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it had killed about 60 Hezbollah fighters and destroyed the Iran-backed group's regional command centre with an air strike. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at the Israeli city of Haifa and areas to its north.","At least 33 killed in Israeli strikes in northern Gaza, local officials say","At least 33 killed in Israeli strikes in northern Gaza, local officials say","israel_and_the_palestinians,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xez14e7lro,articles/article_2865.txt,results/article_2865.txt.json

The agency, quoted by AFP, said many of the dead were women and children, with dozens stilled feared to be under the rubble. Seven people were also injured. The Israeli military said it had been striking militant targets in the northern Gaza, including Beit Lahia, in an attempt to stop Hamas from regrouping. Elsewhere, in central Gaza three separate attacks on refugee camps killed 15 people, while five more were killed in a Israeli drone attack on Rafah in the south, the civil defence added. ""The chances of rescuing more wounded are decreasing because of the continuous shooting and artillery shelling,"" civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. All that is left of the residential building in Beit Lahia is a pile of rubble, with broken concrete and jagged shards of twisted metal sticking out from the ruins. One man, whose family lived in the flattened building, but was staying elsewhere, said, quoted by AFP: ""We all thought that death was near. """"The whole area was shaking. ""The Israeli military said its offensive in northern Gaza - which began in Jabalia and expanded into Beit Lahia - consisted of several strikes overnight on what it called ""terrorist targets in the area"". It added in a statement that ""there have been continuous efforts to evacuate the civilian population from the active war zone"". But many local residents do not want to leave their homes. Mr Bassel said six families had lived in the razed building in Beit Lahia. One woman in the area vented her frustration to BBC News. ""What have we done to you people? What harm have we caused you? What wrong have we committed? We are staying in our homes. Why are you driving us out?”Last week, at least 25 people, including 13 children were killed in a strike on a house in Jabalia. In Gaza City, another five were killed. Israel's ground offensive in northern Gaza has displaced up to 130,000 people over the past five weeks. The United Nations says 75,000 people remain under siege with dwindling supplies of water and food in the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. A report by Human Rights Watch this week said Israel had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by deliberately causing the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza. About 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza’s population - have fled their homes over the past year, and 79% of the territory is under Israeli-issued evacuation orders, according to the UN. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",At least 34 killed in Israeli strike in northern Gaza,At least 34 killed in Israeli strike in northern Gaza,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg5lw7edrlo,articles/article_2866.txt,results/article_2866.txt.json

Dozens of others are injured and many are still trapped under the rubble after the bombing late on Saturday night, officials added. Israel said it was checking reports of casualties but said the figures published by Hamas authorities were ""exaggerated"" and did not match information held by its military. Fighting also continues to be reported in southern Lebanon as well as the south of Beirut on Sunday morning, where smoke was seen rising above the city. Israel said its air force had attacked ""about 175 terrorist targets"" in Gaza and Lebanon over the past day. The Hamas-run government media office said the bombing in Beit Lahia on Saturday night hit ""crowded"" residential areas, and that 73 people had been killed - a number also reported by Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency. The BBC cannot independently verify the figures. According to Palestinian news agency Wafa, an entire residential complex was destroyed in the strikes. Rescue efforts in Beit Lahia are currently hampered due to communications and internet services being severed in the region, Gaza health officials added. The latest strikes come just hours after reports of heavy gunfire from Israeli troops at the Indonesian Hospital in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC it had struck a ""Hamas terror target"" and was ""doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians"". It said the casualties given by the Hamas office were ""exaggerated"" and said such sources had ""proven to be sorely unreliable in previous incidents. ""Israel began a renewed military offensive in northern Gaza in early October, saying it is trying to prevent Hamas from regrouping in the area. In particular, Israeli forces have surrounded and bombarded the densely-populated Jabalia area, which includes an urban refugee camp - with at least 33 people reported killed in a strike late on Friday. Humanitarian groups have warned that virtually no aid has entered the area in the past few weeks. Israel's own statistics show that aid deliveries to Gaza as a whole have collapsed when compared with the same period in September. The UN's top humanitarian official, Joyce Msuya, said on Saturday that Palestinians in northern Gaza are enduring ""unspeakable horrors"" and called for these ""atrocities"" to stop. Israel has repeatedly denied it is preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza but the US has told it to boost access or risk having some American military assistance cut off. Meanwhile, Israel carried out at least a dozen air strikes on Beirut on Saturday, in the heaviest attack the Lebanese capital has witnessed in more than a week. Damage and casualties were still being assessed, but at least one multi-storey building in the city's southern suburbs had been completely destroyed. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah's weapons storage facilities and its intelligence headquarters command centre in Dahieh. Smoke was seen rising from southern Beirut in the early hours of Sunday after Israel's military ordered the immediate evacuation of two neighbourhoods in the area. The IDF told civilians they were ""located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, which the IDF will work against in the near future"". Hezbollah also continued to fire rockets into northern Israel on Saturday, with the Israeli military saying about 200 projectiles - which usually means rockets - were fired. One person was killed by shrapnel while in his car, Israel's medical service Magen David Adom said. Also on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attempt had been made on his life following reports of a drone attack on his private residence. ""The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,"" he wrote in a post on X. Mr Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time, and no one was injured. Iran says Hezbollah was behind the reported attack, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. Hezbollah - which is funded and equipped by Iran - has not commented on the reports.

Israel said it was checking reports of casualties but added that earlier - lower - figures published by Hamas were ""exaggerated"". In recent weeks, the Israel military has been carrying out intense bombardment of northern Gaza, saying it wanted to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping there.  A senior UN official warned that the ""nightmare in Gaza is intensifying"" and the war ""must stop now"". The UN's peace process co-ordinator, Tor Wennesland, said that ""nowhere is safe in Gaza"". In a statement, Tor Wennesland said he condemned the continuing attacks on civilians. ""This war must end, the hostages held by Hamas must be freed, the displacement of Palestinians must cease, and civilians must be protected wherever they are. Humanitarian aid must be delivered unimpeded,"" he said. In a statement on Sunday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry revised its death toll from 73 to 87 after the Israeli strike on Beit Lahia. The earlier casualty figures were provided by Hamas late on Saturday. The ministry also said that ambulance crews were unable to reach the site of the Israeli strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the strike as a ""precision"" attack on a ""Hamas terror target"". It told the BBC it was ""doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians"". Dr Eid Sabbah, Kamal Adwan Hospital's director of nursing, said the Israeli strike in Beit Lahia had completely destroyed several buildings, with ""more than four, five residential blocks. . . razed to the ground"". The strikes targeted an entire residential square, Dr Sabbah said, in between Abu Jidian roundabout and Al Qassam mosque. Dr Sabbah added that dozens of people were killed and many were wounded “some of whom reached the hospital, some of whom remain under the rubble”. He urged for an end to the ""siege"" on hospitals in northern Gaza and ""for life to return to normal. . . before it’s too late, before our nation is exterminated”. Several images - including the one below - have since emerged on social media showing the treatment of the injured from Beit Lahia at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. The images have been verified by the BBC as being from the hospital. Israel confirmed the death of a senior army officer in northern Gaza's Jabalia area on Sunday.

This month - just before the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict - we saw the most harrowing eight hours we've experienced in that time. We received a video message from my wife's cousin in Gaza, saying: ""The tanks are surrounding us and firing at us. These could be the last moments of our lives. ""Pray for us and do anything to save us. ”My wife collapsed, she even lost consciousness: her uncle, aunts and their families - 26 people in total - were all under attack. Israeli raids and advances into cities and villages all over Gaza - targeting Hamas - have been common for most of this year now. We didn't hear anything from them for several hours. They were under bombardment the whole time. Then, finally, a voice note: ""Four people have been injured. Your aunt Wafaa is bleeding, her condition is critical. ""I made countless calls, to the Red Cross, the Palestinian Red Crescent, anyone who could help. After eight hours, the Israeli army finally allowed them to evacuate and move the wounded on foot. But it was too late for Wafaa - she succumbed to her injuries shortly after reaching the hospital. We still have so many relatives in Gaza. My father is there, living in a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis, which was bombed again this week. I'm often overwhelmed by guilt when I call him from Istanbul, where I’ve fled to with my wife and two children. There are so many people like me, in Turkey, in Egypt, and further afield around the world - the UK, the US, Europe - where we’ve had to go to find safety. Not everyone can get out, only those with enough money to pay the high fees for passage elsewhere. But in Egypt alone, more than 100,000 Gazans have crossed south into the country since November.  They’re not under immediate threat there from Israel's bombs. But many are struggling to feed their families, provide education for their children, and just re-establish the basics of a normal life. In an open-air, bustling café in Nasr City in Cairo, dozens of newly arrived refugees huddle in small groups, puffing on hookahs, sharing stories about their homeland. They're trying to alleviate the pangs of longing for those not currently with them.  They cling to hope that the war will end soon, that they can return. But there’s a constant thrum of anxiety. A loud traditional Palestinian song plays over the speakers - a hit by Palestinian singer Mohammed Assaf, who won the Arab Idol competition a few years ago. “Pass through Gaza and kiss its sand. Its people are brave and its men are strong. ”58-year-old Abu Anas Ayyad is among those sitting there, listening. In his past life he had been known as the “King of Gravel”, a successful businessman who had supplied building materials to constructions sites all over Gaza. He and his family - including four children - escaped. But: “Every missile that hits a building in Gaza feels like a piece of my heart shattering. ""I still have family and friends there,” he says. “All of this could have been avoided. But Hamas has a different opinion. ""He rues the Iran-backed group’s attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 and the consequences now. “Despite my love for Gaza, I will not return if Hamas remains in power,” he says. He doesn’t want his children to be “used as pawns in a dangerous game played by reckless leaders for the sake of Iran. ”Sitting nearby is Mahmoud Al Khozondr, who before the war had run his family’s renowned hummus and falafel shop in Gaza. It's an institution in the territory - known for its food and celebrity clientele. The late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had been a frequent patron, often spotted at its tables. Mahmoud shows me pictures of his former well-appointed family home on his phone. They now live in a cramped two-room apartment. His children can’t go to school. “It’s a miserable life,” he says.  “We lost everything back home. But we must rise again,” he says. “We need food for our children, and assistance for our people still in Gaza. ”Living in exile in Egypt is not easy. The authorities have allowed Palestinians to stay temporarily, but they don’t grant official residency. They limit access to education and other key services. Many Gazans try and send money back to support relatives still in Gaza – but remittance fees are steep and war merchants take a 30% cut. “It’s heart-breaking to see profits being made from our loved ones' suffering,” Mahmoud Saqr tells me. He used to own an electronics store in Gaza. These days he has to take a bundle of cash to a shop in Cairo to transfer money to his sister. “There’s no receipt, no proof—just a message hours later confirming they’ve received the money,” he tells me, describing the process. “It’s risky, because we don’t know who is involved in this transaction but we have no choice. ”These are desperate times for everyone. Over the past year in Turkey, I’ve tried in vain to create a peaceful living environment for my family. But every time we go to a restaurant, my children reminisce about their favourite spots in Gaza, their large home, their games shop, their friends at the horse club, their classmates. Some of those classmates have been killed in the Israeli air strikes, which continue. But since October 7, time has stood still for us. We have yet to move on from that day.

According to the UN, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory’s wastewater in June. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he is ""gravely concerned"" and confirmed that efforts are under way to roll out a vaccination programme in the coming weeks. The 10-month-old, who was unvaccinated, is said to be in a stable condition after developing paralysis in one leg. Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. Humanitarian groups have blamed the re-emergence of polio in Gaza on disruption to child vaccination programmes and massive damage to water and sanitation systems caused by the war. In order to try to contain the spread, the UN has been pressing for a week-long pause in fighting to carry out a polio vaccination campaign for more than 640,000 children under the age of 10. UN Secretary General António Guterres said ""hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza [are] at risk"". He said that for the campaign to be successful, transport of vaccines and required equipment would need to be facilitated, as well as the entry of polio experts into Gaza. Adequate fuel, increased flow of cash, reliable communications and the ensured safety of both health workers and people reaching health facilities were also needed, he said. WHO has approved the release of 1.6 million doses of vaccine, UNICEF is coordinating their delivery along with cold storage units and UNRWA’s medical teams will administer the vaccines once they arrive in Gaza. UNICEF’s Executive Director Catherine Russel said that the re-emergence of the virus in the strip after 25 years is ""another sobering reminder of how chaotic, desperate and dangerous the situation has become"". On 18 August, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said since the beginning of the war, 282,126 vials of the polio vaccine, sufficient for 2,821,260 doses, have been sent to Gaza. It said in the coming weeks, an additional 60,000 vaccines will be delivered to vaccinate over one million children. According to the IDF,  entry to the Gaza Strip for vaccines and epidemic prevention is being facilitated by the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT),""This includes the entry of medical teams and vaccines against the polio virus,"" the IDF said. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,265 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children.",Baby contracts Gaza's first case of polio in 25 years,Baby contracts Gaza's first case of polio in 25 years,"israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevjz7zreyxo,articles/article_2871.txt,results/article_2871.txt.json
2872,2024-08-08 16:57:50.509000+00:00,/news/articles/clyl3yg7wzzo,"Over the past week, watched by the world's media, the top leaders of Hamas descended on Qatar to choose a new political leader for their group. Delegates flooded in from across the Middle East after almost a year of fighting between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Some arrived shaken, having woken just days before to the news that the group's previous political leader - Ismail Haniyeh - had been killed in a blast in Tehran, allegedly by Israel. Haniyeh, who had overseen his group's negotiators in talks with Israel, played a crucial role in Hamas, balancing the militant wing's desire to take the fight to Israel with calls from some to reach a settlement and end the conflict. His position, it was clear, had to be filled quickly. At the mourning ceremony in Doha, Hamas leaders lined up shoulder to shoulder in a huge white tent with carpets and fancy chairs, decorated with pictures of Ismail Haniyeh. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the movement’s late leader and his bodyguard. The scene was more than a memorial service - it signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a new, more extreme phase. This was not the first time I had witnessed Hamas’s top officials gather to choose a new leader after an unexpected funeral. Back in 2004 I witnessed them meet after Israel assassinated the group’s founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin – the meeting taking place in his house in Gaza. Less than a month later, Israel killed his successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi. But this time the backstage discussions reflected the extent of the crisis and challenges they are facing. Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza. Since then, Israel’s military retaliation has killed more than 39,600 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and wounded tens of thousands more. More than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and almost the entire population has been displaced. Dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has been growing. The group itself has taken severe losses. On top of this, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on 31 July in Tehran - a place he had always felt to be a safe haven - was a real shock for the organisation. Hamas is convinced that Haniyeh was killed by an anti-personnel missile while he was browsing on his phone. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have said a projectile with a 7kg warhead was used. Some Western media reports say he was killed by a bomb planted in the room beforehand. Back at Haniyeh’s mourning ceremony in Doha, one man in his mid-60s with white hair and a short beard stood in a corner away from the spotlight. “Pay close attention to him,” a Hamas media officer told me. Who was he? “He is the shadowy man, Abu Omar Hassan,” he said. Abu Omar Hassan, or Mohamed Hassan Darwish, is the head of the Supreme Shura Council, the top consultative body in Hamas. According to Hamas’s constitution, he was in prime position to be the organisation’s interim head until elections which had been scheduled for next March. “He is the man of the big missions,” I was told. As the mourning ceremony ended, these leaders’ real work began. For two days, the movement’s veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas’s political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader. They chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day. No political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group’s armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp. Despite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list. “Not all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,” a senior Hamas official told me. “Some leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes. ”Another Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety. “Sinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,” the official said. “He enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appointment in the midst of the war sends a message of defiance to Israel. ”The “axis of resistance” is a network of armed groups backed by Iran. Other members such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah also present threats to Israel. Many Arab and some Western officials urged Hamas against naming Sinwar as leader because of his connection to the 7 October attacks. He and the organisation he now leads are proscribed as terrorists by many governments in the West. “One of the reasons why we voted for him is because we want to honour him for masterminding the attacks” the official said. “October 7th belongs to him so he deserves to lead the movement. ”Ten months on from that attack, all attempts to agree a ceasefire have so far failed. The BBC understands that the two main mediators - Qatar and Egypt - are working on a new ceasefire proposal. Leaks suggest the plan is based on convincing Iran not to respond militarily to the assassination of Haniyeh in its territory, in exchange for Israel ending its war in Gaza and withdrawing troops from the Philadelphi corridor. The Philadelphi Corridor is a buffer zone, only about 100m (330ft) wide in parts, which runs along the Gaza side of the 13km (8-mile) border with Egypt. Gaza's only other land border is with Israel itself. A Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told me in Doha: “Egyptian intelligence has already sent a team to Doha and there are meetings to formulate an action plan based on sparing the region a possible Iranian response… in exchange for a ceasefire. ”For now, the drumbeat of conflict is only getting louder, with Sinwar, the most extremist figure in Hamas, set to lead the group for the next five years - if he survives the war.",Behind the scenes as Hamas chose its new leader,Behind the scenes as Hamas chose its new leader,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyl3yg7wzzo,articles/article_2872.txt,results/article_2872.txt.json
2873,2024-10-09 14:22:21.093000+00:00,/news/articles/cgk707kv3dvo,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a video address Tuesday, which he said was directed at the people of Lebanon, telling them to turn against the Iran-backed Shia group Hezbollah or risk destruction on the scale of Gaza. “Christians, Druze, Muslims Sunni and Shia, all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war against Israel,” he said. “Stand up and take your country back. ”But in Shia, Sunni and Christian neighbourhoods of Beirut on Wednesday morning, Netanyahu’s warning was falling largely – if not entirely – being ignored. “Yes we heard the address but nobody here listens to Netanyahu,” said Yusuf Habbal, 31, as he cut pieces of the traditional Lebanese sweet Kunafah in his shop in Tariq El Jdideh, a Sunni area. “Nobody told Netanyahu to occupy Palestine, nobody told him to occupy Lebanon. It is the Israelis who are driving this conflict. ” But Habbal and his fellow Sunnis “also do not accept what Hezbollah is doing”, he said. “Before Netanyahu ever spoke about Hezbollah, we were against them. Beiruti people know that Hezbollah has their own agenda. And now they are driving us into a war we do not want. ” Hezbollah, which is a better-armed and more powerful force in Lebanon than the country’s own military, began firing rockets into northern Israel a year ago, in support for Hamas the day after the brutal 7 October attack. The Hezbollah rockets signalled the beginning of a new phase of its clash with Israel. Last month, Israel escalated that simmering conflict when it expanded its bombing campaign of Lebanon, including in Beirut, before launching a ground invasion in the south of the country. “They are striking very close to us now and it is terrifying,” said Mohammed Khair, 43, as he had his hair cut in a barber shop in Tariq El Jdideh. “Nobody here wants this war, but nobody is going to be turned against Hezbollah by something Netanyahu said in a video,” he said. Netanyahu was “always talking to the Palestinians, to the Lebanese,” said Tarraf Nasser, a 76-year-old retiree who was passing by the barber shop. “Nobody listens to Netanyahu,” he said. “He is not really talking to us. ” In Achrafieh, Beirut’s main Christian neighbourhood, there was a sense of futility at the Lebanese people’s ability to heed Netanyahu’s advice, even if they wanted to. Antoine, a 75-year-old Catholic retiree, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was smoking a cigarette outside the neighbourhood's Brewholic Café. “Benjamin Netanyahu is the prime minister of Israel, not Lebanon. He should take care of his people, not ours,” Antoine said. “At the same time, it is true that we have to do something to be free from the influence of Iran. But we don’t have weapons and we don’t have politicians who can be truly Lebanese. All our politicians are affiliated to other states or groups, mostly Iran. ""Nobody in Lebanon was going to have domestic conflict because Netanyahu instructed them to, Antoine said. “We will do that on our own. ”Across the road in her shoe shop, Maya Habib, 35, gave a tired shrug at the Israeli prime minister’s video appeal. “Everyone here knows that Israel lies,” she said. “But listen, maybe he has a point. He warned everyone – don’t attack us, don’t come close to us, and it won’t be your war. Now it is. ”Among the Christians of Achrafieh, “people are paying attention” to Netanyahu, Habib said. “But nobody can do anything anyway,” she said, shrugging again. “We don’t even have a president. Netanyahu is saying all the weapons should go to the Lebanese army, but how?” Hezbollah can still rely on staunch support in the neighbourhoods where it is the dominant force in political and social life, and among the Shia communities of mixed areas. Several Shia residents of the Mar Elias neighbourhood said they stood completely behind the group. “We are all Hezbollah here, whatever Hezbollah does we will support them,” said Fadi Ali Kiryani, a 52-year-old corner shop owner. Like other people in Mar Elias, Kiryani said he was not concerned by Netanyahu’s threat that Lebanon would suffer the same destruction and suffering as Gaza. “Even if it becomes worse here than Gaza, we will still fly the flag,” he said. “My house in Dahieh has already been destroyed. I would rather my house was gone than the shoe on the foot of one Hezbollah fighter was damaged. ”Sitting behind the desk of her 40-year-old towel and bedlinens shop, 75-year-old Fany Sharara said that Hezbollah was the only force defending the people of Lebanon. “Nothing Netanyahu could say could change my mind,” she said. “He is a criminal, an assassin, he cannot leave one child alive. ”Israel had “all of Europe and all of America” on its side, Sharara added. “We are with Hezbollah because they are the only ones defending us. Not the Lebanese government. ”A few doors down, and a few years younger, 24-year-old jewellery shop owner Ali Shoura was simply weary of everyone involved, he said. “Nobody really cares - the politicians, the people in power, the Lebanese government, Iran, Israel, America, Hezbollah too. ""He shook his head. “It's all just theatre,” he said. “And we are all the victims. ”Joanna Mazjoub contributed to this report.

2874,2024-10-19 18:47:39.904000+00:00,/news/articles/cevyrj883ppo,"Israel has carried out at least a dozen air strikes on Beirut on Saturday in the heaviest attack the Lebanese capital witnessed in more than a week. Huge plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah's main base is located. In some cases the Israeli military gave warnings to residents to get out, but not much time - in one place just a few minutes. Damage and casualties were still being assessed, but at least one multi-storey building had been completely destroyed. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah's weapons storage facilities and its intelligence headquarters command centre in Dahieh. Also on Saturday, Hezbollah said it fired rockets at the Israeli city of Haifa and areas to its north. One man was killed by shrapnel, Israeli medics said. After three quiet days in Beirut, the southern suburbs were once again thundering with the sound of Israeli air strikes on Saturday. Thick, billowing smoke, black at first, then grey, rose from several neighbourhoods, darkening the sky. Two of the strikes were close to Beirut’s airport, which is still being used for scheduled civilian flights. In the space of one hour, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued three urgent evacuation warnings to residents in several districts in the area. Israeli forces were also continuing to target areas outside of Beirut. North of the city, one couple was filmed trying to escape a suspected Israeli drone. They stopped their car on the side of a highway and ran into the undergrowth, but were killed by a reported missile strike, according to Lebanese state-run National News Agency (NNA). Elsewhere in Lebanon, NNA reported that five people were killed - including a local mayor - in an Israeli strike in the eastern Bekaa Valley region. Several others were wounded in what the NNA said was a strike on a residential apartment. Israel said it is hitting targets in Lebanon linked to the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. The latest Israeli strikes come after the IDF said more than 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon. A drone also targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in the northern coastal city of Caesarea on Saturday morning. The prime minister was not home at the time. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel escalated in October 2023 - when the Lebanese militant group fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. US President Joe Biden has said there is a chance of ""working towards a ceasefire” in Lebanon, where Israel is fighting Hezbollah militants, but it will be ""harder in Gaza”. The war in Gaza began after Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 left around 1,200 people dead, with 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas in response, and since then at least 42,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Beirut rocked by fresh Israeli air strikes,Beirut rocked by fresh Israeli air strikes,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevyrj883ppo,articles/article_2874.txt,results/article_2874.txt.json

Hadid, who is half Palestinian, said:  ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign. ""The advertising campaign for the retro trainers - the SL72s - referenced the 1972 Munich Olympics, which saw 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer killed in the attack by a Palestinian group called Black September. Adidas subsequently apologised and said it would ""revise"" its campaign, confirming to AFP that Hadid had been removed from it. Hadid, 27, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinians and earlier this year donated money to support relief efforts for the war in Gaza. ""I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind,"" Hadid said in a statement shared on an Instagram story on Monday evening. ""In advance of the campaign release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972. "" She continued: ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign. Had I been made aware, from the bottom of my heart, I would never have participated. ""My team should have known, Adidas should have known and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up. ""The campaign released earlier this month saw Hadid holding a floral bouquet for the relaunch of the trainer which originally debuted in 1972,  the same year as the Munich Olympics. Hadid continued: ""While everyone's intentions were to make something positive, and bring people together through art, the collective lack of understanding from all parties undermined the process. ""I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism. That will never waver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent. ""Connecting the liberation of the Palestinian people to an attack so tragic, is something that hurts my heart. ""Palestine is not synonymous with terrorism and this campaign unintentionally highlighted an event that does not represent who we are. ""Hadid described herself as a ""proud Palestinian woman"". ""I will forever stand by my people of Palestine while continuing to advocate for a world free of antisemitism,"" she continued. ""Antisemitism has no place in the liberation of the Palestinian people. ""I will always stand for peace over violence, any day. Hate has no place here, and I will forever advocate for not only my people, but every person worldwide. ""A previous statement from Adidas Originals shared on Instagram said connections to the 1972 attack were ""not meant"". The German company apologised ""for any upset or distress caused to communities around the world"". ""We made an unintentional mistake,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""revising the campaign"". When the ad was launched, it attracted criticism towards Hadid from some quarters, including on social media. But other users defended the model and called for a boycott of Adidas following the move to pull the campaign. The conflict in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.

Officials have not determined whether the documents were released due to a hack or a leak, Mr Kirby said. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed the publication of the documents over the weekend. They are said to contain the movements of Israeli military assets in preparation for a response to Iran's 1 October missile attack. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said the country was prepared to counter any Israeli attack.  The documents, marked top secret, were shareable within the Five Eyes intelligence alliance of the US, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported. There is no ""indication"" that additional documents will ""[find] their way into the public domain"", Mr Kirby said on Monday. He added that President Biden ""will be actively monitoring"" the investigation to uncover how the documents were released, and he intends to hear measures that will be taken ""to prevent it happening again"". What leaked US assessment of Israeli plans to strike Iran showsFor weeks Israel has been deciding how and when to respond to Iran's latest missile attack. Israel's defence minister has warned it will be “deadly, precise and surprising”. The two documents reportedly appear to be attributed to the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency (NSA), and were published on an Iranian-aligned Telegram account on Friday. Johnson, the highest-ranking member of Congress, told CNN on Sunday that ""the leak is very concerning"". ""There's some serious allegations being made, there's an investigation underway, and I'll get a briefing on that in a couple of hours,"" the Louisiana Republican lawmaker said. The Pentagon confirmed in a statement that it was aware of reports about the documents, but did not comment further. The US agencies involved, as well as the Israeli government, have not publicly commented. CNN and Axios first reported the alleged leak, which appears to confirm once again that the US spies on its close ally Israel. One document makes a reference to Israel’s nuclear capabilities - which neither the US nor Israel have officially acknowledged - apparently ruling out the use of such an option in any planned strike. One former American intelligence official told the BBC that the unauthorised release was probably an attempt to expose the scale of the planned retaliation, possibly to disrupt it. The US is investigating whether the information was intentionally leaked by a US agent, or whether it was stolen, possibly through hacking, officials told the Associated Press. The two documents appear to be based on satellite information obtained from 15-16 October. The first is titled: ""Israel: Air Force Continues Preparations for Strike on Iran and Conducts a Second Large-Force Employment Exercise,"" according to Reuters news agency. It describes ballistic and air-to-surface missile handling. The second is titled: ""Israel: Defense Forces Continue Key Munitions Preparations and Covert UAV Activity Almost Certainly for a Strike on Iran"". It discusses Israeli drone movements. On Friday, Biden said he had a ""good understanding"" of what Israel was planning. ""Do you have a good understanding of what Israel is going to do right now in response to Iran. . . and when they will actually respond?"" a reporter asked him. ""Yes, and yes,"" Biden replied.

Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden are thought to have discussed Israel's response to Iran's missile attack last week amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The White House said US Vice-President Kamala Harris also joined the 30-minute call on Wednesday. Not long after the call wrapped up, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said its retaliatory attack against Iran would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"". ""They will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,"" Gallant said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described Biden and Netanyahu's conversation as ""direct and very productive"". She told reporters that discussions on the Iran attack continued and said that as long as Beirut's main airport remained open, the US would continue to make flights available for Americans still in Lebanon. Elsewhere in the Middle East region, fighting has continued between Hezbollah and Israel, with four people killed in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese village near the southern city of Sidon. In the small Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, a couple out walking their dog were killed by Hezbollah rockets fired from Lebanon. They are the first Israeli civilians to die since the cross-border conflict dramatically escalated 12 days ago. Rockets have also struck the Israeli port city of Haifa, injuring at least five people. Israel said it has carried out more than 1,100 air strikes since its ground invasion began in southern Lebanon on 30 September. In an update shared on Wednesday evening, the Israeli Air Force said it had used fighter jets, helicopters and remotely manned aircraft to attack Hezbollah's sites - and has also attacked 300 targets in northern Gaza as part of the fighting in Jabalia. Previously, Netanyahu has vowed Iran will ""pay the price"" for the Iranian barrage - which Tehran said was in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon and high-profile assassinations of Hezbollah leaders, including the late Hassan Nasrallah. The US has defended Israel's right to retaliate, but has also appeared to be trying to limit its response to Iran. Lebanon abandoned by international community - ex PMAnalysis: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider warAnalysis: What will it take to end the conflict? Lebanon’s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Almost 180,000 people are in approved centres for the displaced. In addition, more than 400,000 people have fled into war-torn Syria, including more than 200,000 Syrian refugees - a situation that the head of the UN’s refugee agency described as one of “tragic absurdity”. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident. . . in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza.

Tensions are high between Iran and Israel after the Iranian attack on Tuesday, which Israel said was mostly repelled by its missile defence system. Iran said the barrage was a response to the killings of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan. Its attack also came after Israel announced a ground assault into Lebanon, in an effort to dismantle what it called Iran-backed Hezbollah's “terrorist infrastructure” in border villages. The US has repeatedly called for de-escalation and has also led long-running negotiations on a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza but so far without success. Biden's comment to reporters on Wednesday came during a trip to tour hurricane damage in North Carolina with Vice-President Kamala Harris. ""Would you support an attack on Iran's nuclear sites by Israel?"" Biden was asked by a reporter. ""The answer is no,"" he responded. He added that the US ""will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do"". He also said that he had consulted with the leaders of other G7 countries and they all agree that Israel ""has the right to respond, but they should respond proportionally"". US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, at a briefing, added: “It’s clear that this was an unprecedented escalation by Iran. ""Israel has the right to respond to it. We’re having discussions about what that response will be”. So far, the White House has given no public indication of how it believes Israel should respond to Iran's attack. In a video message on Tuesday, Biden said that at his direction, US military forces in the region had helped shoot down the missiles fired from Iran. He said the Iranian attack had been ""defeated and ineffective"", calling it ""a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected.

2880,2024-08-20 02:41:19.095000+00:00,/news/articles/cvge9k0r1llo,"Thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest near the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on its opening day, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. But several demonstrators were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence around the Chicago venue. The turnout appeared to be well below the tens of thousands that organisers had hoped for and short of the 15,000 they claimed turned out. Later in the evening, President Joe Biden acknowledged that the protesters ""out on the street have a point"" in his primetime convention farewell speech. ""A lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides,"" he said, adding that a US-brokered ceasefire - which has so far proved elusive - was necessary. Protests in Chicago have highlighted divisions among Democrats over one of the most contentious issues on the left of American politics, US support for Israel’s war in Gaza. At one point during Monday's protest, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators knocked down a fence around the convention security perimeter and streamed through. Chicago Police said the protesters did not breach an inner security fence and that the situation was quickly contained. At least four people were detained. Many of the Gaza war demonstrators said they saw little difference between Mr Biden and his Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is formally accepting the Democratic White House nomination this week after the president dropped out of the race last month and endorsed her. “The Democratic Party may present a new face, but its support for Israeli repression remains unchanged,” said Omar Younes, a co-founder of Jisoor, a Palestinian youth organisation in Chicago. Another protester, Tallis George Munro, said he would definitely vote for Ms Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, but did not want to give them a “free pass” on their support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr Munro, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he was more worried about what he described as a ""bigger threat"" – the policies of Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""We are close to white Christian nationalism with Trump,"" he said. ""That is the biggest problem in this country now. ""Other protesters told the BBC they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, or they would not vote at all. The rally-goers also heard from independent presidential candidate Cornel West, a philosophy professor and left-wing activist. ""This is not about some Machiavellian politics or some utilitarian calculation about an election,"" he told the crowd. ""This is about morality. "" After months of legal wrangling over the route, protesters followed a 1.1 mile (1.8km) path around the DNC site, chanting slogans including ""No justice, no peace, US out of the Middle East"" and ""Kamala Harris is a cop, all this violence has to stop"" – a reference to the vice-president's career as a prosecutor and California attorney general. The demonstrators also chanted ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". This refers to the land between the River Jordan, bordering the occupied West Bank and Israel in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Anti-semitism monitors say it calls for the destruction of Israel but pro-Palestinian groups deny the slogan is hateful. Earlier in the day, a small contingent of pro-Israeli counter-protesters briefly rallied on the edge of Union Park, where the pro-Palestinian march began and ended. The march drew people from neighbouring states and further afield. Karyna Lemus attended as a member of the Colorado Springs People’s Coalition. She said she’s been involved in the Palestinian rights movement for decades. “I hope they hear us inside,” she said of the DNC delegates.

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.

2881,2024-11-22 02:58:46.119000+00:00,/news/articles/c704y7gwr95o,"US President Joe Biden has called an International Criminal Court war crimes arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister “outrageous”. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu's now sacked defence minister Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas commander, Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was killed in July. Judges said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe the three men bore ""criminal responsibility"" for crimes during the war between Israel and Hamas. Europe and the US were split in their response to the warrant, with several European countries saying they respect ICC decisions. The British government indicated that Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK.  Biden said in a statement, external that ""whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security. ""Both Israel and Hamas reject the allegations made by the ICC. In a statement on Thursday, Netanyahu said: ""The antisemitic decision of the international court in The Hague is a modern Dreyfus trial, and it will end the same way. ""He was referring to a high-profile case of antisemitism in France just over a century ago. ""The court in The Hague accuses us of a deliberate policy of starvation,"" the Israeli PM said. ""This when we have supplied Gaza with 700,000 tons of food to feed the people of Gaza. We issue millions of text messages, phone calls, leaflets to the citizens of Gaza to get them out of harm's way - while the Hamas terrorists do everything in their power to keep them in harm’s way, including shooting them, using them as human shields. ""Netanyahu said Israel would ""not recognise the validity"" of the ICC's decision. Just this week, the UN warned that Palestinians were ""facing diminishing conditions for survival"" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because virtually no aid had been delivered in 40 days. Gallant said the ICC placed ""the state of Israel and the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimises the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds”. Ehud Olmert, a former Israeli prime minister, told the BBC that while he was critical of Netanyahu's handling of the conflict with Hamas, he did not agree with the ICC's decision. ""Israel has not committed genocide or war crimes that deserve these charges against the prime minister and the minister of defence,"" Olmert told Radio 4's World Tonight programme. Hamas made no mention of the Deif warrant but said the move against Netanyahu and Gallant constituted an ""important historical precedent, and a correction to a long path of historical injustice against our people"". Palestinians in Gaza expressed hope Israeli leaders would now be brought to justice. Israel denies the allegation that its forces are committing genocide in Gaza, which is the subject of a separate case before the International Court of Justice. The impact of the warrants announced by the ICC, external will depend on whether the court's 124 member states - which do not include Israel or its ally, the US - decide to enforce them or not. A spokesperson for the UK Prime Minister did not comment specifically on the case, but said that the UK would always “fulfil the obligations under the act and indeed our legal obligations”. This refers to the International Criminal Court Act 2001, which states that if the court issues a warrant for arrest, a Secretary of State “shall transmit the request. . . to an appropriate judicial officer"". If the officer was satisfied the warrant was issued by the ICC, they ""shall endorse the warrant for execution in the United Kingdom"". Officials from the EU and across Europe have all made statements standing by the Court. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ""the decision of the court has to be respected and implemented"". The Dutch foreign minister said ""we will act on the arrest warrants"" and Italy said it would support the Court, which should ""play a legal role and not a political role"". The German chancellor's spokesman said Berlin had ""unique relations with a great responsibility for Israel"" and further action would only be taken when a stay by Netanyahu and Gallant was ""foreseeable"". Two of Israel's closest allies in the EU rejected the Court's decision. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would invite Netanyahu to visit and ""guarantee him that if he comes, the ICC's ruling will have no effect in Hungary"". Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the court had made ""an unfortunate decision"" in equating ""the elected representatives of a democratic state with the leaders of an Islamist terrorist organisation”. South Africa, which has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice accusing it of genocide, welcomed the decision, and urged ""all state parties to act in accordance with their obligations in the Rome Statute"". South Africa failed to honour an ICC arrest warrant against the Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in June 2015. The ICC prosecutor's case against Netanyahu, Gallant and Deif stems from 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign to eliminate Hamas, during which at least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. For Deif,, external an ICC pre-trial chamber found reasonable grounds to believe he was ""responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence"". It also said there were reasonable grounds to believe the crimes against humanity were ""part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel"". For Netanyahu and Gallant,, external who was replaced as defence minister earlier this month, the chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that they ""each bear criminal responsibility for the following crimes as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts"". It also found reasonable grounds to believe that ""each bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population"".",Biden says ICC war crimes arrest warrant 'outrageous',Biden says ICC war crimes arrest warrant 'outrageous',"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c704y7gwr95o,articles/article_2881.txt,results/article_2881.txt.json

Iran said the barrage was a response to the killings of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan. Mr Biden told reporters that he was not expecting Israel to launch its retaliation on Thursday.

""A US official told Reuters news agency the US believes Israel is “still determining what exactly they will do. ”Mr Biden earlier said the US did not support strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, as touted by some in Israel, including former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett. Bennett argued striking Iran's nuclear facilities could ""help change the face of the Middle East"" and “fatally cripple this terrorist regime”. Reports in Israeli media citing local officials suggest Israel plans to first strike Iran’s oil facilities. If Iran then hits back, Israel will target its nuclear facilities. Speaking on Wednesday, Iran's chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV that it would hit infrastructure across Israel if it retaliates.

2883,2024-09-24 18:47:14.400000+00:00,/news/articles/cr4xnq2zqlgo,"US President Joe Biden has spent nearly a year vowing his determination to prevent the war in Gaza engulfing the wider Middle East. On Tuesday, he repeated that resolve in his last ever United Nations speech as president, as he addressed the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. “A diplomatic solution is still possible. In fact, remains the only path to lasting security,” Biden said. “Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,” he added. But the Israel-Lebanon crisis is now on the brink. And Biden’s calls for restraint from the podium of the UN, like his pleas for Israel and Hamas to finally reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal, are being heard in the hall but not in the region. On Monday, Israel unleashed hundreds of airstrikes on Lebanon, inflicting the deadliest day on the country since the end of its bloody, sectarian civil war more than three decades ago. Israel’s bombardment killed more than 500 people, according to Lebanese health officials. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed armed group that dominates the country – reeling and damaged from Israel’s wave of exploding pager attacks last week - launched hundreds of rockets into northern Israel, smashing homes and setting streets ablaze. Once again the US is trying to restrain Israel, the key regional ally it arms, and urging its adversaries against escalating too, all the while seeking a diplomatic outcome that the sides themselves lack either the ability or will to agree. Live: Latest news on Israel and HezbollahExplained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Watch: Hezbollah rockets hit residential areas in IsraelAnalysis: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy Israel says it’s acting to disarm the Lebanese militia so Israeli residents can return to their homes in the north. Hezbollah says it’s been striking Israel for the past 11 months to deter and degrade Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Months of shuttle diplomacy by the US envoy Amos Hochstein - building on already established UN Security Resolutions on Israel and Hezbollah - have come to nothing. Instead, in another split screen moment as Biden was urging calm at the podium at the UN, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video on X vowing: ""We will continue to hit Hezbollah. He who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his garage - he will not have a home. ""The White House supports what it calls Israel’s right to hit Hezbollah. But the often dysfunctional political relationship with the Israeli leadership has again become apparent over recent weeks, amid serious concerns in the administration that the exploding pager attacks and subsequent Israeli airstrikes could lead to all out war. No call between Biden and Netanyahu was announced despite the crisis of the last week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently made his tenth trip to the region since the 7 October attacks but for the first time did not visit Israel. Critics both within and outside the administration have repeatedly blamed an inability of the White House to wield influence over Netanyahu on a failure to condition US weapons supply. The administration categorically rejects this, saying it is committed to Israel’s defence. President Biden always believed the key to solving the crisis on the Israel-Lebanon border, involving 11 months of cross border fire and tens of thousands of people displaced on either side, was instead clinching the ceasefire deal in Gaza. But this is badly stalled with few signs either side is willing to reach it. Blinken recently pinned this on a lack of “political will” by both Israel and Hamas. The White House denies that it is pursuing a diplomatic effort doomed to defeat – and that President Biden, with four months left in office, has given up hope of achieving a breakthrough. “No, he absolutely hasn’t given up,” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of Biden’s attempts to reach a deal that would end the war in Gaza. “There have been difficulties and setbacks. We’ve had challenges getting the [Israeli] prime minister across the line. We’ve had challenges getting Hamas’s leader Sinwar across the line. But we’re determined to keep at it,” Mr Sullivan told CNN. “The president this week in New York will be huddling with other leaders to try to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza and really critically, to try and avert an all-out war in the Middle East. ”Behind the scenes here in New York, a stream of diplomacy is taking place. According to a senior state department official, the US is presenting allies with potential plans to resolve the crisis between Israel and Hezbollah. “We’ve got some concrete ideas we’re going to be discussing with allies and partners this week to try to figure out the way forward on this,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pressed on what the “concrete ideas” were, the official would not be drawn, noting instead that while the US does not speak directly to Hezbollah, some of its allies gathered in New York do and these partners “might have a more refined sense of Hezbollah thinking so we can stress test our ideas. ”But the official also renewed US opposition to any Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. And they rejected Israeli officials’ reported belief that ramping up the conflict with Hezbollah could force them into cutting a diplomatic deal that would stabilise the situation on either side of the Israel-Lebanon border – a strategy referred to as “de-escalation by escalation”. “I can't recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de escalation and led to profound stabilisation of the situation,” said the official.",Biden struggles to contain conflict as Israel and Hezbollah on the brink,Biden struggles to contain conflict as Israel and Hezbollah on the brink,"israel,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4xnq2zqlgo,articles/article_2883.txt,results/article_2883.txt.json

In a call on Wednesday, which was also joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr Biden is said to have stated the importance of removing “any remaining obstacles” blocking an agreement with Hamas. He also reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to help defend Israel against what the White House called ""all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis"". It came after the US secretary of state wrapped up a diplomatic tour of the Middle East, pushing for a deal that could end the war. The office of Mr Netanyahu reiterated on Wednesday that Israel planned to keep troops in a strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt - known as the Philadelphi Corridor - in the event of any such deal. “Israel will insist on the achievement of all of its objectives for the war, as they have been defined by the security cabinet, including that Gaza never again constitutes a security threat to Israel. This requires securing the southern border,” a statement said. The issue has become a key sticking point - with Hamas so far insisting on a total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Egypt also opposes the presence of Israeli troops along its border with Gaza. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel had agreed to a “US bridging proposal”, after a three-hour meeting with Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Mr Blinken would not confirm to the BBC whether the US proposal stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Philadelphi corridor, but Mr Netanyahu’s repeated public insistence on the plan appears to have irritated Washington. A US official accused the prime minister of making “maximalist statements” that were “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. A new round of ceasefire talks is set to take place in Cairo this weekend, with US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari representatives in attendance. Hamas has so far not said they will attend, but it is believed they are continuing to receive updates on the negotiations from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. A member of the Hamas political bureau told the BBC on Monday that the group had “agreed a deal [through mediators] on 2 July” and therefore “don't need a new round of negotiations or to discuss the new demands of Benjamin Netanyahu”. “We have shown maximum flexibility and positivity,” Basem Naim said. He claimed that Mr Netanyahu was “not interested in reaching a ceasefire, only in flaring up the region. . . and serving his own personal political interests"". In Gaza on Wednesday, at least 50 Palestinians were killed by Israeli air strikes, Hamas-run health authorities said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit around 30 targets across the territory, including tunnels, launch sites and an observation post. The targets included the UN-run Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which the IDF said was used by “Hamas operatives” as a “hideout”. The strike killed at least four people and wounded 15, the Hamas-run Civil Defence service said. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, said that children were killed in the strike and some were “burnt to death"". ""Gaza is no place for children anymore. They are the first casualty of this merciless war,"" he said, adding that “a ceasefire is beyond overdue"". Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,223 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement also exchanged fire on Wednesday, with Israel saying it hit a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the Bekaa Valley overnight. The Lebanese health ministry said one person was killed and 30 others injured. In response, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it targeted Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights with a rocket barrage.

He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: ""Whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know - but I’m not counting on that. ”Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,"" he said. ""And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that. ""Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November. Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: “I don’t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel’s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s actions, as connected to the American election. ""Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel’s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November. Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close.

While the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close. ""Hamas is not there with a deal. There’s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,” the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to  reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation. ""The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,"" he said. ""If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.

2886,2024-08-05 20:03:06.745000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2yylgze4ro,"Warning: This article contains details which some readers may find upsetting Israel’s leading human rights organisation says conditions inside Israeli prisons holding Palestinian detainees amount to torture. B’tselem’s report entitled “Welcome to Hell”, external, contains testimony from 55 recently released Palestinian detainees, whose graphic testimony points to a dramatic worsening of conditions inside prisons since the start of the Gaza war 10 months ago. It's the latest in a series of reports, including one last week by the UN, which contain shocking allegations of abuse directed against Palestinian prisoners. B’tselem says the testimony their researchers have gathered is remarkably consistent. “All of them again and again, told us the same thing,” says Yuli Novak, B’tselem’s executive director. “Ongoing abuse, daily violence, physical violence and mental violence, humiliation, sleep deprivation, people are starved. ”Ms Novak’s conclusion is stark. “The Israeli prison system as a whole, in regard to Palestinians, turned into a network of torture camps. ” Since the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the number of Palestinian detainees has doubled to around 10,000. Israel’s prisons - some run by the army, others by the country’s prison service - have become overwhelmed. Jails are overflowing, with a dozen or more inmates sometimes sharing cells designed to accommodate no more than six. B’tselem’s report describes overcrowded, filthy cells, where some inmates are forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes without mattresses or blankets. Some prisoners were captured in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel’s invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank. Many were later released without charge. Firas Hassan was already in jail in October, held under “administrative detention”, a measure by which suspects – though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge. Israel says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law. Firas says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October. “Life totally changed,” he told me when we met in Tuqu’, a West Bank village south of Bethlehem. “I call what happened a tsunami. ”Mr Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel and much of the West. He makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was “active”. Familiar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October. “We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,” he said. “We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us. ”Mr Hassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg). A video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure. “I spent 13 years in prison in the past,” he told B’tselem researchers later that month, “and never experienced anything like that. ” But it’s not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons. Israeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them. Mr Khourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas – a charge quickly dismissed. But his brief experience of prison – his first – nearly broke him. “They just lost their mind,” he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo. “There was no law. There was no order inside. ”Mr Khourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates. “They were hitting them badly for no reason,” he told us. “They were screaming, the guys, ‘we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us. ’”Speaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal. “It wasn’t the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterwards everything was different. ”During a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda’s network of caves in Afghanistan), Mr Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell. According to Mr Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterwards. According to last week’s UN report, “announcements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody of the IPS between 7 October and 15 May”. Israel’s military advocate, meanwhile, said on 26 May that it was investigating the deaths of 35 Gaza detainees in army custody. Several months after Mr Khourieh’s release – again, without charge – the lawyer is still struggling to make sense of what he witnessed at Megiddo. “I’m an Israeli…I’m a lawyer,” he told us. “I’ve seen the world outside the prison. Now I’m inside. I see another world. ”His faith in citizenship and the rule of law, he says, has been shattered. “It was all crushed after this experience. ”We put claims of the widespread mistreatment of Palestinian detainees to the authorities involved. The army said it “rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees”. “Concrete complaints regarding misconduct or unsatisfactory conditions of detention,” the army told us, “are forwarded to relevant bodies in the IDF, and are dealt with accordingly. ”The prison service said it “was not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred”. Since 7 October, Israel has refused to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Palestinian detainees, as international law requires. No explanation has been given for this refusal, but the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently expressed its frustration over the ICRC’s failure to gain access to Israeli and other hostages being held in Gaza. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) has accused the government of “consciously defying international law”. Last week, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners ignited a furious public row, as far right demonstrators – including members of Israel’s parliament – violently tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a prisoner from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military base. Some of those protesting were followers of Israel’s hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, the man in overall charge of the prison service. Mr Ben Gvir has frequently boasted that under his watch, conditions for Palestinian detainees have deteriorated sharply. “I’m proud that during my time we changed all the conditions,” he told members of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, during a rowdy session in July. For B’Tselem, Mr Ben Gvir bears a heavy responsibility for the abuses now being reported. “These systems were put in the hands of the most right wing, most racist minister that Israel ever had,” Yuli Novak told us. For her, Israel’s treatment of prisoners, in the wake of the traumatic events of 7 October, is a dangerous indicator of the nation’s moral decline. “The trauma and anxiety walks with us each and every day,” she says. “But to let this thing turn us into something that it not human, that doesn’t see people, I think is tragic. ”","Blindfolded, bound and beaten: Palestinians tell of Israeli jail abuse","Blindfolded, bound and beaten: Palestinians tell of Israeli jail abuse","palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2yylgze4ro,articles/article_2886.txt,results/article_2886.txt.json
2887,2024-08-29 16:12:03.860000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2nyy8y48qo,"A blogger who attracted a following on Instagram and TikTok by documenting daily life in Gaza has been killed in a strike. Mohammad 'Medo' Halimy, 20, was hit by shrapnel from a nearby blast caused by an Israeli missile in Khan Younis on Monday, according to two youth organisations he had previously worked with. The Tamer Institute for Community Education told the BBC that Halimy was in an area near the beach where displaced people have sheltered when he was fatally struck. The IDF told the BBC it could not confirm a strike took place in Khan Younis on Monday, but said it was continuing to ""counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians"" in Gaza. Halimy built up a social media audience after his family were forced to flee their home when Israel began its military operation in Gaza in the wake of the 7 October attacks. More than 250,000 people followed him on Instagram and TikTok after he began posting videos detailing his life as one of Gaza's displaced citizens in Rafah and Khan Younis. Halimy's videos ranged from simple cooking recipes he had created with limited supplies and appliances, to walkthrough videos of how he made his content. In an interview last year, he said every clip he posted to social media cost him about $3 - a large sum in Gaza. He posted his final video on Monday, hours before he was killed, in which he showed the tent he was living in and detailed what he had done that day. Both Palestinian organisations which confirmed his death to the BBC said the fatal strike happened in a nearby street and Halimy was injured by flying debris. He died the following day. Spark, a Gaza-based charity with which Halimy had worked in the summer of 2023, confirmed his death to the BBC and praised his ""ability to add beauty and splendour to a place wherever it is” in a post online. ""Muhammad, your kind spirit will remain with us, and we believe you deserve a better world,"" it added. ""May God have mercy on you, my beloved,"" his sister Rahaf wrote in a post on Instagram announcing his death. ""May God accept you as a martyr. "" Earlier this year, Halimy told NBC News, external he hoped his content would help ""to show the world what our life really looks like"". “I’m showing that us Palestinians are very resilient,” he told the US broadcaster. ""We're going to survive and live no matter what happens, in whatever circumstances. We can't be defeated. We're very strong people, and we're going to live no matter what. ”Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 104 hostages still being held, including 34 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Indirect talks have continued in Cairo in recent days, but so far there has been no sign of a breakthrough over key sticking points. They include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s demand that Israel keep troops along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas and Egypt have rejected.

2888,2024-10-24 16:04:19.599000+00:00,/news/articles/ce891r9pd48o,"From the outside, it is hard to comprehend the depth of suffering experienced by civilians in Gaza. On Monday 21 October, a video emerged from Jabalia that gave an unusually detailed insight into the pressure and the horror imposed on civilians by Israel’s current offensive in northern Gaza. Watching it, you feel almost like an eyewitness. Every day, like many journalists who are forced to report the war from outside Gaza because Israel will not let us in, I watch many videos that emerge online, harrowing scenes of wounded, dying and bereaved people in hospitals, of men in the rubble rescuing survivors and digging out bodies, and civilians forced to move by the Israelis, walking through thick sand where roads used to be, past the unrecognisable ruins. Bowen: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider warUS warns Israel over Gaza aidNowhere is safe in Gaza, says doctor working there They are all horrible to see, and so was the one that came from the attack in Jabalia on Monday morning. But for me it was unusual because it showed the pain, grief, chaos, panic and hopelessness in the seconds and minutes immediately after an attack. The moment is so extreme that taking out a phone to film it is the last thing most people do. Over many years as a reporter in wars, I have seen and experienced the same disbelief and shock. It takes time for the brain to catch up with the utterly changed reality that your eyes are seeing. The Jabalia Boys Elementary school was attacked just after 09:00 in the morning, on 21 October. It was no longer a place of learning but had been turned into a shelter for displaced civilians, like many schools in Gaza run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. All the ones still standing, that is. In the video, a paramedic called Nevine al Dawawi, increasingly panic-stricken, runs between dead and dying civilians, using her phone to document what is happening (when I reported this first, on the day of the strike, she was misidentified as Nabila. )We managed to track down Nevine in Gaza City. She was able to give us her own account of what happened on Monday morning. She answered questions, and much more composed now, she played back the video. In it, she is agitated and scared, running between civilians lying in their own blood, next to dead bodies. This story contains some distressing details from this point “Calm down,” she screams at a badly hurt woman sitting in a pool of blood. “I swear I don’t have anything to stop the bleeding. ”She runs down a passage pockmarked by shrapnel. On a stairwell she sees more casualties, turns away in horror, picks up a bag and says ""let’s go, so no-one else gets killed"". A man’s voice on the video says, “stay with us Nevine. ” Grabbing the bag, which is full of wound dressings, she goes back to the stairwell that is running with blood. A child’s voice says, please help, my sister is dying, please help me. A woman says my children are gone. Nevine asked how she knew. “Look at them,” the woman says. One is very still, the other has a severe head wound and is either dead or dying. Nevine hands over dressings, even though it is too late. They are all she has, and she is the only paramedic there. Nevine told us that the woman on the stairs whose children were killed was Lina Ibrahim Abu Namos. Journalists working for the BBC found her in Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia where she is being treated for shrapnel injuries. Two of Lina’s seven children were killed, her eldest daughter and her only son. Her husband wasn’t with them when the attack happened, as he was already being treated for wounds sustained in an earlier attack. “I saw my daughter dying, with my own eyes. She was dying in front of me. I couldn't stop it, and she was my eldest, my whole life, honestly, my entire life. When your eldest dies in front of you…”“I couldn’t save her, and I was also wounded. I couldn’t handle myself, I found myself falling on the ground. I started crawling towards her. ” Nevine, the paramedic, explained that they had been ""besieged"" at the school for 16 or 17 days. Above them was the buzz of quadcopters, small drones used extensively by the IDF. It has a range of them, for surveillance and espionage, to issue orders through loudspeakers, for dropping bombs or firing at Palestinians they want to kill. “We were living in so much fear. When the school was hit, we had people killed and injured. There was nothing there to eat or drink. The water tanker that was usually sent to us was bombed by the Israelis. It was like that for days. Three days ago, a quadcopter descended on the school at nine in the morning, giving us an ultimatum to get out by 10. The quadcopter loudspeaker said we had to evacuate the school because we were in a dangerous fighting zone. ”“We didn’t have time to pack our stuff. It gave us just one hour. After just 10 minutes, Israeli airplanes bombed the school. It was a big massacre with over 30 wounded and more than 10 killed. ”In the video, the wounded and dead on the bloody stairs are not the only casualties. Nevine leaves the stairwell, and runs to a man probably in his sixties, who is leaning over a pile of bags with his head in his hands.  She looks to see if somehow, he has survived a severe neck wound and screams when she sees that he has not. “Help him, he’s dead – it’s Uncle Abu Mohammed. ” Three days later I sent questions for a Palestinian freelance journalist to ask her at al Ahli hospital in Gaza City. One was about Abu Mohammed. “He was our neighbour. His two sons were also killed… one had half his head gone. ”She talked our reporter through the video as she played it back on her phone. “The video showed girls torn to pieces. It also shows men with their intestines protruding from stomach wounds… A 10-year-old boy had his bowels bulging outside his stomach. His mum was killed, injured in the heart. ”“Some women who were taking cover were also injured and others killed. A cleaner at the school was shredded into pieces. A 12-year-old girl had a leg blown off. So did a woman displaced from Beit Hanoun, a town in Gaza’s north. She was aged between 35 and 40. ”The day before the attack on the school, as Israel’s offensive intensified, Tor Wennesland - the senior UN diplomat in Jerusalem - issued a strong statement. “The nightmare in Gaza is intensifying. Horrifying scenes are unfolding in the northern Strip amidst conflict, relentless Israeli strikes and an ever-worsening humanitarian crisis. ”“Nowhere is safe in Gaza. I condemn the continuing attacks on civilians. This war must end, the hostages held by Hamas must be freed, the displacement of Palestinians must cease, and civilians must be protected wherever they are. Humanitarian aid must be delivered unimpeded. ”Israel insists that it acts in self-defence, and claims its forces respect the laws of war. Almost every day for the last year in Gaza, and more recently in Lebanon it says that civilians get killed because armed groups use them as human shields. We put that to the paramedic, Nevine al Dawawi. The IDF claimed Hamas was using civilians as human shields, is that true?“No, Hamas was not using civilians as human shields. They were protecting us and standing with us. ” For many in Israel, her statement that Hamas were in the area will be taken as a justification for the horrors that the IDF brought down on the civilians just after 9 in the morning on Monday 21 October. But war crimes lawyers will ask whether the attack was justified. The laws of war say that civilians must be protected, and that casualties inflicted on them should be in proportion to the military threat faced by an attacking force. If senior Hamas commanders were there, or a big concentration of fighters preparing to fight, perhaps the attack could be justified by the Israel Defense Forces’ own lawyers. But if Hamas, whose structure as a fighting force has been dismantled in a year of relentless Israeli attacks, had only a few local men with guns in the area, then the attack would breach the law. In the unlikely event that the Palestinians in the video ever had a day in court, their lawyers could say that the military threat to the IDF at that moment did not justify wounding 30 civilians, inflicting life changing injuries, and killing more than 10 others, including many children. I am forced to use conditional tenses because I am writing this in Jerusalem, not after interviewing eyewitnesses at the scene of the attack in Jabalia in Gaza. Reporters will always struggle to get to get to the best possible version of the truth they can find when they are stopped from getting to the place where the story happened. Israel allowed reporters into their border communities along the border with Gaza in the days after the Hamas attacks last year. I was in Kfar Azza kibbutz when they were still recovering the bodies of dead Israelis, as soldiers checked buildings with bursts of gunfire. They wanted us to see where Hamas had killed around 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and dragged more than 250 into captivity in Gaza. The evidence is piling up that Israel has done things in Gaza that it does not want journalists to see, which is why they will not let us cross into the territory, except on rare and highly controlled visits with the army. I have been in only once, in the first month of the war, when Israeli firepower had already turned the areas of northern Gaza that I saw into a wasteland. As a result, journalists rely on videos and statements that emerge from Palestinians inside Gaza, including some very brave journalists, and from international diplomats, medics and aid workers who are allowed into Gaza, and witnesses like Nevine with smartphones. In the hospital, Lina Ibrahim Abu Namos was haunted by her loss of her eldest daughter, her only son, and everything they called home. “I had seven children, and now I only have five left…  What can I say? I don’t even know. By God, they have broken our hearts. We are exhausted, emotionally drained. We’ve lost everything. ”“What crime have the children committed? What have they done? What have we done to deserve this?”“What have we done to the Israelis? I swear, they’ve destroyed our children. ”""I’m so scared. I don’t eat or drink. Nothing. All I need is for my children to stay around me, because we are scared and we’ve been displaced from one place to another. What is left for my daughters and for me? There’s no home, nowhere safe, nothing. I’m just one of many people with nowhere to go, no safety. I'm exhausted. ”",Bowen: Gaza nurse who filmed moments after Israeli strike describes chaos and grief,Bowen: Gaza nurse who filmed moments after Israeli strike describes chaos and grief,"israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce891r9pd48o,articles/article_2888.txt,results/article_2888.txt.json
2889,2024-07-29 13:15:27.192000+00:00,/news/articles/c6p2j85k8dro,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that Hezbollah will pay ""a heavy price"" for an attack that killed 12 children at a football pitch in Majdal Shams on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. The costs that Mr Netanyahu, his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Israel’s military chiefs decide to inflict on Hezbollah will determine whether the war either side of the Israel-Lebanon border stays limited and relatively controlled or explodes into something much worse. The border war started the day after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year, when Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel to support the Palestinians. Since then, it has been fought within a grisly set of unspoken understandings. Israel and Hezbollah have mostly aimed at military targets, though both have also killed civilians. As a result, the war, though highly dangerous, has stayed limited. Even so, tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have left their homes. Busy communities have become ghost towns. The fear from the outset has been that a big attack on either side’s civilians would cause uncontrolled escalation and in turn, cause a much worse war, as both Israel and Hezbollah bring their full force to bear.  Action against Hezbollah in the largely depopulated areas of south Lebanon might avoid escalation. Killing Lebanese civilians in Beirut or destroying infrastructure like bridges or power stations would not. Hezbollah claims, unconvincingly, that it did not carry out the attack in Majdal Shams. Even so, it is hard to see why it would target Druze children at a football match. Hezbollah has mostly stuck to the tacit rules of the conflict, trying to kill soldiers, not civilians since it started the border war on 8 October. It might have been aiming for the extensive Israeli early warning stations on military positions on Mount Hermon. Hezbollah is a much more formidable enemy of Israel than Hamas. It is more powerful than the fragile Lebanese state and operates without consulting it. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah is close to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Hezbollah fighters are disciplined and well trained, and Iran has supplied them with a formidable arsenal of missiles that can hit Israel’s cities. Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill in their last big war in 2006. Its men have extensive combat experience after fighting for years in Syria in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Israel’s leadership know all that. They also know that despite their vast firepower they have not yet subdued Hamas in Gaza, and the reservists their army relies on are feeling considerable strain. Israel is also under heavy pressure from its allies, including the US - without which it cannot sustain its war effort - not to take action that would escalate the war into an all-out fight. The Americans and the French have tried to negotiate a way of de-escalating the Israel-Hezbollah border war. The absence of a ceasefire in Gaza blights their chances of success. The border between Israel and Lebanon remains the mostly likely place for the wider Middle East war to intensify. Even if the crisis caused by the killing of young football players and spectators in Majdal Shams passes without a much worse conflagration, the ""rules"" of the border war are tattered, imperfect, unstable and continue to carry the risk that a single bloody incident will touch off another catastrophic war.",Bowen: Golan attack leaves border war's unspoken rules in tatters,Bowen: Golan attack leaves border war's unspoken rules in tatters,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p2j85k8dro,articles/article_2889.txt,results/article_2889.txt.json
2890,2024-10-26 15:19:54.404000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2742rynqgo,"Israel’s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel’s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime. Iran’s official media in the hours before and after Israel’s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel’s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America’s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. ""I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,” he said. ""I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond. ""Iran’s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey’s NTV network that ""any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered. ”Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: ""Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force. "" It was, he said, ""highly misleading and baseless"" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran’s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence ""as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter"". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression. Israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called ""axis of resistance"" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel’s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran’s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran’s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden’s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden’s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel’s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to ""take the win"" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden’s plan seemed to be working. But since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran’s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah’s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel’s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza’s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It’s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel’s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation. It is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don’t respond. That is how wars spin out of control. The question now is whether Iran is prepared to give Israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. President Biden backed Israel’s decision to retaliate after 1 October. But once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling Israel publicly not to bomb Iran’s most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. He augmented Israel’s defences by deploying the THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, and prime minister Netanyahu agreed to take his advice. The American elections on 5 November are part of both Israel and Iran’s calculations about what happens next. If Donald Trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than  Biden about answering Iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities. Once again, the Middle East is waiting. Israel’s decision not to hit Iran’s most valuable assets might, perhaps, give Tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. At the UN General Assembly last month, the Iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations. All this should matter greatly to the world outside the Middle East. Iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. But its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. Its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. Developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.",Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak,Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2742rynqgo,articles/article_2890.txt,results/article_2890.txt.json
2891,2024-10-02 08:21:06.697000+00:00,/news/articles/c4g5wdezxe7o,"When Iran attacked Israel in April, it seemed like it was making a point – but Iran effectively gave notice of the attack in terms of how it carried it out, and everything was pretty much shot out of the air by Israeli and American defences. This time around it’s different. The Iranians looked like they wanted to do some serious damage and were making a much more aggressive point. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps put out an announcement saying that they were retaliating to the killings of senior leaders in Hamas and Hezbollah, and warned that if Israel retaliated, in turn they would strike back. Last time around, Joe Biden said to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu – “Take the win”, don’t carry out a big response - and they didn’t. This time around in Israel the mood is very different. FOLLOW LIVE: Israel and Hezbollah fighting on the ground in Lebanon after Israeli invasionLook at the tweet from former prime minister Naftali Bennett last night, using very strong language, saying: “This is the greatest opportunity in 50 years to change the face of the Middle East. ” He was arguing that Israel should go after Iran’s nuclear facilities, in order to “fatally cripple this terrorist regime”. Now he’s not prime minister (although he is widely tipped to be a future one, so he was making a point to show he is tough) but it does reflect a certain mood in the country. I would not rule out attacks by Israel on anything at the moment – nuclear sites, petrochemical facilities, anything that could cause damage to the Iranian economy. The scenario always was that Iran had a forward defence in the shape of Hezbollah in Lebanon, with a massive arsenal of sophisticated weapons, to be used, in theory, if Iran and its nuclear facilities were attacked. But in the last couple of weeks, Israel has decapitated the Hezbollah organisation, destroyed half of its weapons, according to American and Israeli authorities; and invaded Lebanon. Explained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?BBC Verify: Analysing footage of Israeli strikes on BeirutWhat are Israel’s Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow missile defences?The deterrent Iran had, you could argue, is not just gone – it’s smashed into a thousand pieces. So I think the Israelis are feeling more free to act. And Joe Biden is moving another carrier battle group to the Mediterranean, signalling to the Iranians that if you hit Israel, you hit the US too. This is why people were talking about the fear of the war spreading: the instability, the turbulence that comes from everything that’s been happening – now we are seeing it play out and it leaves very little room for diplomacy at this moment.","Bowen: Iran wanted to do real damage, and Israel's response may not be as restrained as last time","Bowen: Iran wanted to do real damage, and Israel's response may not be as restrained as last time","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g5wdezxe7o,articles/article_2891.txt,results/article_2891.txt.json
2892,2024-09-23 15:38:44.422000+00:00,/news/articles/c2kdg7jwvz7o,"Monday was the bloodiest day in Lebanon since Hezbollah’s 2006 war with Israel. Israel launched a massive series of air strikes this morning that have so far killed 492 people according to the Lebanese government and the Israelis are warning of more attacks to come. The war is escalating fast, a process that is being driven by the scale of Israel’s air offensive. They are warning civilians to leave the areas they’re targeting. The next, they’ve said, will be the Bekaa Valley in the north-east of Lebanon which is a Hezbollah stronghold. Live updates: Israel strikes dozens more sites in southern Lebanon'We just had to flee': Fear and tension in LebanonCold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflictDeadliest day in years for Lebanon as Israel steps up strikes on HezbollahWhat is Hezbollah in Lebanon? Even before the current escalation, well over 100,000 Lebanese had to leave their homes because of Israeli strikes, with no immediate expectation of being able to return. We are seeing yet another very large escalation by the Israelis. Perhaps their calculation is that they believe Hezbollah is in such a weakened position right now that this is their opportunity to really inflict some damage on it, and to change the strategic picture in the hills and towns on either side of the border between Israel and Lebanon. While the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict has been going on for decades, the current war between them started the day after the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year. Hezbollah started a limited but continuous campaign of rocket fire over the border, trying to tie down Israeli troops and damage Israeli property and people. Around 60,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate to the centre of the country. In the last few days, returning them to their homes has been added to Israel’s list of war aims. The US and UK, and other allies – and critics – of Israel believe that the only hope of cooling this dangerous crisis is to get a ceasefire in Gaza. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has said attacks on Israel will go on until a Gaza ceasefire happens. But it seems pretty clear at this point that neither the leader of Hamas nor the leader of Israel is prepared to go for the deal the US has put on the table. The war itself has overwhelming support from Israelis, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains unpopular with significant parts of Israel’s electorate, despite an improvement in his poll ratings. Many Israelis also think Netanyahu is an appalling leader who tells lies and has abandoned the hostages in Gaza. So he is a very controversial character, but bolstered in the parliament by the right wingers who support him, he is politically secure. His decision to go on the offensive is risky. While Hezbollah is wounded, it has plenty of capacity to hit back.

2893,2024-09-24 19:56:47.558000+00:00,/news/articles/c93pg1qpxxzo,"Israel’s leaders are jubilant about the progress of the offensive against Hezbollah that started with the detonation of weaponised pagers and radios and moved on to intense and deadly airstrikes. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant did not hold back his praise after Monday’s air strikes. “Today was a masterpiece… This was the worst week Hezbollah has had since its establishment, and the results speak for themselves. ”Gallant said airstrikes destroyed thousands of rockets that could have killed Israeli citizens. In the process Lebanon says Israel killed more than 550 of its citizens, including 50 children.  That is almost half Lebanon’s dead in a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israel believes that a ferocious offensive will coerce Hezbollah into doing what it wants, inflicting so much pain that its leader Hassan Nasrallah and his allies and backers in Iran decide that the price of resistance is too high. Israel’s politicians and generals need a victory. After almost a year of war Gaza has become a quagmire. Hamas fighters still emerge out of tunnels and ruins to kill and wound Israeli soldiers and are still holding Israeli hostages. Hamas caught Israel by surprise last October. The Israelis did not see Hamas as a significant threat, with devastating consequences. Lebanon is different. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Mossad spy agency have been planning the next war against Hezbollah since the last war ended in a stalemate in 2006. Israel’s leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believes the current offensive is making big progress towards his declared objective of tipping the balance of power away from Hezbollah. He wants to stop Hezbollah firing rockets over the border into Israel. At the same time, the Israeli military says the plan is to force Hezbollah back from the border and to destroy military facilities that threaten Israel. The last week in Lebanon brings back echoes of the last year of war in Gaza. Israel issued warnings to civilians, as it did in Gaza, to move out of areas about to be attacked. It blames Hezbollah, as it blames Hamas, for using civilians as human shields. Some critics as well as enemies of Israel said the warnings were too vague and did not give enough time for families to evacuate. The laws of war demand that civilians be protected, and forbid indiscriminate, disproportionate use of force. Some of Hezbollah's attacks on Israel have hit civilian areas, breaking laws designed to protect civilians. They have also targeted the Israeli military. Israel and key Western allies, including the US and UK, classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Israel insists it has a moral army that respects the rules. But much of the world has condemned its conduct in Gaza. The ignition of a wider border war will deepen the gap at the centre of a highly polarised argument.  Live: Latest news on Israel and HezbollahExplained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Watch: Hezbollah rockets hit residential areas in Israel Take the pager attack. Israel says it was aimed at Hezbollah operatives who had been issued with the pagers. But Israel could not know where they would be when the bombs inside the pagers were triggered, which was why civilians and children in homes, shops and other public places were wounded and killed. That, some leading lawyers say, proves that Israel was using deadly force without distinguishing between combatants and civilians; a violation of the rules of war. The fight between Israel and Hezbollah started in the 1980s. But this border war began the day after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, when Hassan Nasrallah ordered his men to begin a limited, but almost daily barrage over the border to support Hamas. It tied up Israeli troops and forced around 60,000 people in border towns to leave their homes. A few voices in the Israeli media have compared the impact of the air strikes on Hezbollah's capacity to wage war to Operation Focus, Israel’s surprise attack on Egypt in June 1967. It was a famous raid that destroyed the Egyptian air force when its aircraft were lined up on the ground. Over the next six days Israel defeated Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The victory created the shape of the current conflict as Israel captured the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It is not a good comparison. Lebanon, and war with Hezbollah, is different. Israel has inflicted heavy blows. But so far it has not stopped Hezbollah's capacity or will to fire into Israel. Israel’s earlier wars with Hezbollah were grinding, attritional and never produced a decisive victory for either side. This one might go the same way, however satisfying the last week of offensive action has been for Israel, its intelligence services and its military. Israel’s offensive rests on an assumption - a gamble - that a point will come when Hezbollah will crumple, retreat from the border and stop firing into Israel. Most observers of Hezbollah believe it will not stop. Fighting Israel is the main reason why Hezbollah exists. That means Israel, just as reluctant to admit defeat, would have to escalate the war further. If Hezbollah continued to make northern Israel too dangerous for Israeli civilians to return home, Israel would have to decide whether to launch a ground offensive, probably to capture a strip of land to act as a buffer zone. Israel has invaded Lebanon before. In 1982 its forces swept up to Beirut to try to stop Palestinian raids into Israel. They were forced into an ignominious retreat in the face of fury at home and abroad, after Israeli troops held the perimeter as their Lebanese Christian allies massacred Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. By the 1990s Israel still occupied a broad band of Lebanese land along the border. Today’s Israeli generals were then young officers, who fought in endless skirmishes and firefights against Hezbollah, which was growing stronger as it fought to drive Israel out. Ehud Barak, then Israel’s prime minister and a former chief of staff of the IDF, withdrew from the so-called ""security zone"" in 2000. He decided that it did not make Israel any safer and was costing Israel the lives of too many soldiers. In 2006 an ill-judged raid by Hezbollah across the tense and highly militarised border killed and captured Israeli soldiers. After the war ended Hassan Nasrallah said he would not have allowed the raid had he realised what Israel would do in return. Ehud Olmert, by then Israel’s prime minister, went to war. At first Israel hoped air power would stop rocket attacks into Israel. When it did not, ground troops and tanks once again rolled back over the border. The war was a disaster for Lebanese civilians. But on the last day of the war, Hezbollah was still launching salvoes of rockets into Israel. Israel’s commanders know that entering Lebanon under fire would be much more formidable military challenge than fighting Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah has also been making plans since the end of the 2006 war, and would be fighting on home ground, in south Lebanon which has plenty of rugged, hilly terrain that suits guerrilla tactics. Israel has not been able to destroy all the tunnels Hamas dug through sand in Gaza. In the borderlands of south Lebanon, Hezbollah has spent the last 18 years preparing tunnels and positions in solid rock. It has a formidable arsenal, supplied by Iran. Unlike Hamas in Gaza, it can be resupplied by land through Syria. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington DC, estimates that Hezbollah has around 30,000 active fighters and up to 20,000 reserves, mostly trained as mobile small units of light infantry. Many of its men have combat experience fighting in support of the Assad regime in Syria. Most estimates say that Hezbollah has something between 120,000 and 200,000 missiles and rockets, ranging from unguided weapons to longer-range weapons that could hit Israel’s cities. Israel may be gambling that Hezbollah will not use all of them, fearful that the Israeli air force will do to Lebanon what it did to Gaza, turning entire towns to rubble and killing thousands of civilians. Iran might not want Hezbollah to use weapons it would like to reserve as insurance against an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. That’s another gamble. Hezbollah might decide to use more of its arsenal before Israel destroys it. With the war continuing in Gaza, and rising levels of violence on the occupied West Bank, Israel would also have to contemplate a third front if it invaded Lebanon. Its soldiers are motivated, well trained and equipped, but the reserve units that provide much of Israel’s fighting power are already feeling the strain after a year of war. Israel’s allies, led by the United States, did not want Israel to escalate the war with Hezbollah and do not want it to invade Lebanon. They insist that only diplomacy can make the border safe enough for civilians to return to their homes on either side of it. An American envoy has worked out an agreement, partly based on UN Security resolution 1701 that ended the 2006 war. But diplomats have their hands tied without a ceasefire in Gaza. Hasan Nasrallah has said Hezbollah will stop attacking Israel only when the Gaza war stops. At the moment neither Hamas nor the Israelis are prepared to make the necessary concessions that would produce a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and a swap of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. As Israeli air strikes continue to pound Lebanon, civilians who were already struggling to provide for their families in a broken economy face terrible pain and uncertainty. Fear crosses front lines. Israelis know that Hezbollah could do them much worse damage than they have in the last year. Israel believes the time has come to be aggressive and audacious, to blast Hezbollah away from its borders. But it faces an obdurate, well-armed and angry enemy. This is the most dangerous crisis in the long year of war since Hamas attacked Israel and at the moment nothing is stopping it spiralling towards something much worse.

2894,2024-07-31 19:04:05.187000+00:00,/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,"Israel has inflicted two devastating blows on its enemies. It has not confirmed that it killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but it is hard to see who else would have wanted him dead more than the Israelis. As for the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Israel says he was killed in Beirut in an “intelligence-based elimination”. For Israel, everyone senior in Hamas is a legitimate target after the attacks of 7 October 2023, which inflicted the worst single day of bloodshed on Israel since independence in 1948. Fuad Shukr, Israel says, was killed because as a veteran Hezbollah commander he was responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12 children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah has confirmed he was killed in the raid on Beirut. It denies carrying out the attack in the Golan. Once again, the Middle East is full of speculation that the all-out war feared since 7 October is imminent. The deadly irony is no side wants that war, but increasingly they are prepared to risk it. The Israelis have been under pressure from their American allies to calibrate their response to Hezbollah, inflicting a blow that will hurt the group without provoking a devastating retaliation and igniting a wider and deeper war. But two assassinations amount to a major gamble. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, might still decide that an attack on their stronghold in southern Beirut warrants a matching attack on Tel Aviv. Israel might also have calculated that Iran would not go to war over an assassinated Palestinian leader, even though his death in their capital, under their protection, is a humiliation. Killing Haniyeh, just after he had met the new Iranian president, is a dramatic display of Israel’s reach. The Islamic Republic thought it re-established deterrence when it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in April - that claim has now been exposed as hollow. April’s barrage was also retaliation, for the Israeli air strike that killed two Iranian generals in Iran’s embassy in Damascus. More retaliation looks certain from Iran, its ally Hezbollah or one of its proxies. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have made it clear that they blame the US equally for what has happened. In the Red Sea, the Houthis might redouble their attacks out of Yemen. There are limits to what Hamas can do, after months of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. But the Israelis are on high alert for attacks in the occupied West Bank or inside Israel itself. It is important to realise that the Middle East is already in a regional war, but also to recognise that it could get much worse. Even so, this round of killing and retaliation might not be the spark that ignites all-out war, though it is easy to construct scenarios based on the clear and dangerous risks and realities in the world’s most turbulent region. Pulling back from the brink, repeatedly, is not making war any less likely. It makes it harder to construct a diplomatic pathway away from the looming threat of all-out conflict. The only credible first step for lowering the deadly temperature in the Middle East is a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks the Americans have said that it was getting closer. That was always hard to imagine while the two sides’ definitions of an acceptable ceasefire were so far apart. For Hamas, a ceasefire meant an Israeli withdrawal and the end of hostilities. For Israel, it meant a pause that allowed for the release of some or all of the surviving hostages, and the right to resume the war afterwards. Now a ceasefire in Gaza looks as far away as ever, although the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said again that it remains America’s diplomatic priority. Ismail Haniyeh was a leading figure on the Hamas side in the ceasefire talks. With his colleagues, he communicated with the US and Israel via the head of the Egyptian secret service and the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohamed bin Jassim al Thani. The prime minister posted his response to the assassination of Haniyeh on X, writing: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask how mediation can succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side. ”The assassination fits more closely into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conception of “total victory” over Hamas than into the American idea that a ceasefire is vital to avoid an even deeper regional catastrophe. It will also strengthen the belief held by Mr Netanyahu’s critics inside and outside Israel that he wants to prolong the war, to avoid the moment when he faces a reckoning of the mistakes he made that allowed Hamas the space to attack with such devastating consequences on 7 October. The Americans and French have also worked hard to find a diplomatic way to stop the border war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the vital first step would be a ceasefire in Gaza, and the prospect one was close has taken another hammer blow.",Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,articles/article_2894.txt,results/article_2894.txt.json
2895,2024-10-17 20:54:13.729000+00:00,/news/articles/cm24q3204y3o,"Killing Yahya Sinwar is Israel's biggest victory so far in the war against Hamas in Gaza. His death is a serious blow for Hamas, the organisation he turned into a fighting force that inflicted the biggest defeat on the state of Israel in its history. He was not killed in a planned special forces operation, but in a chance encounter with Israeli forces in Rafah in southern Gaza. A photo taken at the scene shows Sinwar, dressed in combat gear, lying dead in the rubble of a building that was hit by a tank shell. Follow live updates on this storyWho was Yahya Sinwar?Explainer: How Israel killed Hamas leader Sinwar in a chance encounterWatch: Netanyahu says focus on hostages after Sinwar deathExplainer: What has happened to Hamas' most prominent leaders? Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, praised the soldiers and made clear that however big a victory, it was not the end of the war. ""Today we made clear once again what happens to those who harm us. Today we once again showed the world the victory of good over evil. ""But the war, my dear ones, is not over yet. It is difficult, and it is costing us dearly. """"Great challenges still lie ahead of us. We need endurance, unity, courage, and steadfastness. Together we will fight, and with God's help - together we will win. ""Netanyahu and the overwhelming proportion of Israelis who support the war in Gaza needed a victory. The prime minister has repeated his war aims many times - destroying Hamas as a military and political force and bringing the hostages home. Neither has been achieved, despite a year of war that has killed at least 42,000 Palestinians and left much of Gaza in ruins. But the remaining hostages are not free and Hamas is fighting and sometimes killing Israeli troops. Killing Sinwar was the victory Israel wanted. But until Netanyahu can claim that the other war aims have been accomplished, the war, as he says, will go on. Yahya Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip.  He was five years old when it was captured by Israel from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. His family were among more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by Israeli forces in the 1948 war in which Israel won its independence. His family came from the town now known as Ashkelon, which is close to the northern border of the Gaza Strip. In his 20s, he was convicted by Israel of killing four Palestinian informers. During 22 years in jail he learnt Hebrew, studied his enemy and believed that he worked out how to fight them. His time in jail also meant Israel had his dental records and a sample of his DNA, which meant that they could identify his body. Sinwar was released as one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were swapped in 2011 for a single Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit. On 7 October last year, in a meticulously planned series of attacks, Sinwar and his men inflicted Israel's worst-ever defeat - and a collective trauma that is still deeply felt. The killing of around 1,200 Israelis, the hostage-taking and the celebrations of their enemies recalled for many Israelis the Nazi holocaust. Sinwar's own experience in a prisoner swap must have convinced him of the value and power of taking hostages. In Tel Aviv families of the remaining 101 hostages in Gaza - Israel says half of them might already be dead - gathered in the square in which they have been gathering for a year, urging the Israeli government to launch a new negotiation to get their people home. Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker appealed to the prime minister. ""Netanyahu, don't bury the hostages. Go out now to the mediators and to the public and lay out a new Israeli initiative. """"For my Matan and the rest of the hostages in the tunnels, time has run out. You have the victory pictures. Now bring a deal!""""If Netanyahu doesn't use this moment and doesn't get up now to lay out a new Israeli initiative - even at the expense of ending the war - it means he has decided to abandon the hostages in an effort to prolong the war and fortify his rulership. ""We will not give up until everyone returns. "" Many Israelis believe that Netanyahu wants to prolong the war in Gaza to put off the day of reckoning for his share of the security failures that allowed Sinwar and his men to break into Israel, and to postpone perhaps indefinitely the resumption of his trial on serious corruption charges. He denies those accusations, insisting that only what he calls 'total victory' in Gaza over Hamas will restore Israeli security. Like other news organisations, Israel does not let the BBC cross into Gaza except on rare, supervised trips with the army. In the ruins of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Sinwar, Palestinians interviewed for the BBC by local trusted freelancers were defiant. They said the war would go on. ""This war is not dependent on Sinwar, Haniyeh, or Mishal, nor on any leader or official,"" said Dr Ramadan Faris. ""It's a war of extermination against the Palestinian people, as we all know and understand. The issue is much bigger than Sinwar or anyone else. ""Adnan Ashour said some people were saddened, and others were indifferent about Sinwar. ""They're not just after us. They want the entire Middle East. They're fighting in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. . . This is a war between us and the Jews since 1919, over 100 years. ""He was asked whether the death of Sinwar would affect Hamas. ""I hope not, God willing. Let me explain: Hamas is not just Sinwar. . . It's the cause of a people. ""The war goes on in Gaza. Twenty five Palestinians were killed in a raid on northern Gaza. Israel said it hit a Hamas command centre. Doctors at the local hospital said the scores of wounded that they treated were civilians. Parachute drops of aid resumed after the Americans said Israel had to allow in more food and relief supplies. Every leader of Hamas since the 1990s bar one has been killed by Israel, but there's always been a successor. As Israel celebrates killing Sinwar, Hamas still has its hostages and is still fighting.","Bowen: Sinwar's death is serious blow to Hamas, but not the end of the war","Bowen: Sinwar's death is serious blow to Hamas, but not the end of the war","israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm24q3204y3o,articles/article_2895.txt,results/article_2895.txt.json
2896,2024-09-18 10:33:39.030000+00:00,/news/articles/c30lpyl46z3o,"It has been the deadliest year in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since 1948, when Israel fought and won its war for independence – and this is one of the most dangerous moments since Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October last year. Attacking Hezbollah’s communications network has delivered a tactical victory to Israel - the sort of spectacular coup you would read about in a thriller. However there is a potentially serious strategic downside for Israel, because while this humiliates the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement, it doesn’t deter them. And it doesn’t get closer to Israel’s strategic aim of stopping Hezbollah’s attacks and allowing the more than 60,000 Israelis on the northern border who haven’t been in their houses for nearly a year to return home. LIVE: Latest updates on the Hezbollah pager explosionsWhat we know about the attack in LebanonWatch: Video appears to show explosion at supermarketWhat is Hezbollah in Lebanon and why is it fighting with Israel? The Israelis have used important, audacious weapons, which are clearly very effective in their terms. But reports in Al Monitor, a respected Middle East newsletter, say that they were not able to use them in the way they hoped. The original plan, it says, was for Israel to follow up with devastating attacks while Hezbollah was still reeling. The pager attack, the reports say, was to be the opening salvo in a big escalation - as part of an offensive or perhaps an invasion of southern Lebanon. But these same reports say that Hezbollah was getting suspicious – forcing Israel to trigger these attacks early. So the Israelis have shown they can get into Hezbollah’s communications and shown they can humiliate them, but these attacks do not take the region one inch further back from all out war. Instead they push it closer. Everything at the moment in terms of de-escalation in the Middle East depends on Gaza. While that war continues, whether it’s conflict with Lebanon, whether it’s attacks in the Red Sea from the Houthis, whether it’s tensions with Iraq; nothing is going to de-escalate. The US envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein has been working assiduously for months now - talking to the Lebanese, and indirectly to Hezbollah and to the Israelis, about trying to find a way to deescalate this diplomatically. And reportedly, the Israelis didn’t tell the US about what they were doing with this plan until last moments - so this won’t help his efforts either. American predictions that a ceasefire in Gaza is close have come up again against two seemingly immovable objects. One is the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, who wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip permanently, as well as a big release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. The other is Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has stuck to his insistence that Israel can and will win a total victory over Hamas. The consensus in Israel is that he benefits from prolonging the war, despite pressure from hostage families and their supporters for a deal to get their people home.  The prime minister’s ultranationalist allies in his coalition have also threatened to bring down the government if he makes a deal. Israel and its allies insist that taking the war to its old enemies in Lebanese Hezbollah is an entirely legitimate act of self-defence. But there is fury and alarm in Lebanon and the wider region that Israel’s attacks appear to have been launched with little concern for bystanders and family members who have been wounded and killed alongside Hezbollah fighters. CCTV footage showed a pager exploding in a crowded market as its owner shopped for food. Reports in Lebanon say a young girl was killed when her father’s pager exploded. Hezbollah will be reeling from the attacks, but it will rapidly compose itself as an organisation and will find other ways to communicate. Lebanon is a small country and messages can easily be carried by hand. Undoubtedly Hezbollah and its allies in Iran, whose ambassador to Beirut was wounded in the attack, will be licking their wounds at the moment. But once again the region has been pushed right to the brink of an all-out war. Sooner or later, if this continues,  they will fall over the cliff.","Bowen: Tactical triumph for Israel, but Hezbollah won't be deterred","Bowen: Tactical triumph for Israel, but Hezbollah won't be deterred",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c30lpyl46z3o,articles/article_2896.txt,results/article_2896.txt.json
2897,2024-10-16 19:50:49.771000+00:00,/news/articles/c3e9q4nylwjo,"The first aid in two weeks has gone into northern Gaza following a letter from the US that gave Israel 30 days to boost humanitarian access, or risk having some military assistance cut off. The letter is the Biden administration’s most detailed public criticism yet of the way Israel has blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza. It was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and was supposed to be private, until it was leaked to Israeli journalists, external. It is a blueprint for an entirely different approach by Israel to the aid operation in Gaza - expediting it, rather than imposing restrictions. The letter is a line-by-line examination of Israel’s obstruction of aid deliveries – and the way its forcible relocation of civilians has exposed 1.7 million Palestinians to serious risk of disease. It even challenges Israel’s long-standing attack on UNRWA, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees. The US is “very concerned” about proposed new laws that would “remove certain privileges and immunities”. An Israeli government minister wants to confiscate UNRWA’s headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem to use the land for a Jewish settlement. The US says it acknowledges Israeli concerns about UNRWA, but that restrictions on it would “devastate” the humanitarian effort in Gaza and the education and welfare of tens of thousands of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. The letter cannot have made easy reading for its two recipients, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, and Ron Dermer, its minister of strategic affairs, who is one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest advisers. That is not just because the letter details the “US government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza”. It also contains a reminder, that is also a threat, that US laws restrict arms transfers to countries that block the distribution of American aid. Gallant set the tone of Israel’s approach to humanitarian aid flows to Gaza two days after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. He announced a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip. No fuel or food would be allowed in, he said. “Everything is closed. . . We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. ”Pressure, not least by the Americans, forced Israel to moderate Gallant’s plan, but the aid coming in has never been consistent or adequate. In recent months, though, restrictions have been tightened, which seems to have prompted the letter. It is a sign of the exasperation and anger inside the Biden administration that Israel has not kept its promises to keep aid flowing into Gaza. The European Union’s chief diplomat and leading human rights groups have already accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. In May, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, accused Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant of starvation of civilians as part of his application for the court to issue arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Both men rejected the allegation. When Netanyahu spoke at the UN General Assembly in New York on 27 September, he dismissed accusations that Israel was starving Gazans as “an absurdity”. He presented a version of Israel’s role in the Gaza aid operation that is diametrically opposed to the one described in Blinken and Austin’s letter. For Netanyahu, the accusations were another sign of antisemitism at the UN and its institutions. Israel, he said, was beset by “lies and slanders”. “Good is portrayed as evil, and evil is portrayed as good. ”“We help bring in 700,000 tonnes of food into Gaza. That’s more than 3,000 calories a day for every man, woman, and child in Gaza. ” The hard facts in the US letter are a stark contrast to his emotive rhetoric. Some of them focus on restrictions Israel imposed in September, while Netanyahu made his claims in New York. “The amount of assistance entering Gaza in September was the lowest of any month during the past year” - in other words, since before Hamas’s 7 October attacks last yearThe US is particularly concerned by ""recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September”The Americans also criticise the way Israel slows the delivery of aid by imposing onerous rules, and make a number of specific demands: They want the removal of the restrictions on the use of closed lorries and containers, and to increase the number of vetted drivers to 400. UN agencies say that a shortage of drivers and lorries has made getting aid into Gaza much harderIsrael must tighten and speed up security and customs checks. Aid organisations say cumbersome rules are used to slow deliveries downThe Americans want aid to be funnelled through the port of Ashdod in an “expedited” route to the Gaza Strip. Ashdod is a modern Israeli container port a short drive north of Gaza. After Israel refused to let it be used, the US spent an estimated $230m (£174m) on a floating pier for aid deliveries into Gaza that broke up in bad weather before it could make a differenceIsrael should also remove restrictions on deliveries from JordanIsrael argues that Hamas steals aid and sells it at inflated prices. The Americans do not directly engage with that, except in a single sentence that acknowledges there has been “increased lawlessness and looting”. Front and centre in the letter is Israel’s squeeze on Gaza. Their criticism extends way beyond the mechanics of getting aid into Gaza. It demands an end to the isolation of northern Gaza, where ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu’s cabinet want to replace Palestinians with Jewish settlers. Concern about northern Gaza has increased since Israel started its current offensive there. The army’s actions have resembled parts of a plan put forward by a group of retired officers, led by Giora Eiland, a major-general who used to be Israel’s national security adviser. Eiland says he wanted a deal to get the hostages back and end the war early on. But as that didn’t happen, he believes more radical action is necessary. Israel has already separated northern Gaza from the south with a corridor along Wadi Gaza that bisects the territory. Eiland told me that his plan was to open evacuation routes for a week to 10 days so that as many of the 400,000 or so civilians left in the north leave. Then the territory would be sealed, all aid supplies cut, and everyone left inside would be considered a legitimate military target. A version of the plan appeared to be in place at Jabalia camp in the north, after it was sealed off by Israeli troops, tanks and drones. The Blinken-Austin letter insists that there can be “no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians from northern to southern Gaza”. Aid agencies should have “continuous access to northern Gaza” and should be able to enter it direct from Israel rather than taking the hazardous and often deadly route from the south. Orders to evacuate must be cancelled “when there is no operational need”. Israel has forced 1.7 million civilians, many of whom fled northern Gaza, into a narrow strip of land along the coast between al-Mawasi and the town of Deir al-Balah, where the letter says ""extreme overcrowding exposed the civilians to a high risk of contracting serious diseases"". The Americans want the pressure to be eased, for civilians to be allowed to move inland before the winter. BBC Verify has established that Israel has also bombed what it says are Hamas targets in an area it calls a humanitarian zone. The letter had immediate results. For the first time since the beginning of October, Israel has allowed in convoys of lorries carrying aid, though not yet on the scale requested by the US. Whether the letter can end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, particularly in the absence of ceasefire, is another matter. Israel has been given 30 days to remedy matters. The US presidential election happens within that time frame. Before polling day, the US would not restrict weapons shipments to Israel, especially given the fact that the Israelis are on the brink, potentially, of a much wider war with Iran. If Vice-President Kamala Harris wins, the Biden administration will be able to keep up the pressure on Israel until the inauguration in January. It is likely to be a different story if former President Donald Trump gets his second term. Based on Trump’s previous four years in office, Netanyahu is likely to feel he has much more freedom to do what he wants as he runs down the clock on Joe Biden’s time in the White House. Biden has been widely criticised, in his own Democratic Party and further afield, for not using the leverage that should come with America’s position as Israel’s most vital ally. Without US military and diplomatic support Israel would struggle to fight its wars. The letter looks like a serious attempt to impose pressure. In the last year of war, Netanyahu has often ignored US wishes. A turning point came at the UN General Assembly in late September, when the US, UK and other allies of Israel believed they had talked Israel into accepting a 21-day truce in Lebanon to make time for diplomacy. Instead, Netanyahu’s speech doubled down, rejecting a truce and escalating the regional war. From his hotel in New York, he ordered the assassination of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Some senior Western officials complain that the Biden administration has been “played” by Netanyahu. The letter is a belated attempt to redress the balance. Biden has been convinced he can best influence Israel by offering unconditional support. He advised Israel after 7 October not to be blinded by rage, as he said America was after the al-Qaeda’s 9/11 attacks. But his wishes have often been ignored by Netanyahu. Whether or not Israel listens to America’s demands on Gaza, as Biden enters his last lap as president, it is clear that his attempt to stop the spread of the Gaza war across the Middle East has failed. And as for the letter, it will be too little, too late for all those civilians in Gaza who have suffered, and for those who have died, as the result of months of restrictions in humanitarian aid imposed by Israel.",Bowen: US threat to cut Israel military aid is sign of anger at broken promises,Bowen: US threat to cut Israel military aid is sign of anger at broken promises,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e9q4nylwjo,articles/article_2897.txt,results/article_2897.txt.json
2898,2024-09-27 22:44:24.146000+00:00,/news/articles/ckgn5xkp3rko,"It is time to stop talking about the Middle East being on the brink of a much more serious war. After the devastating Israeli attack on Lebanon – which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah – it feels as if they’re tumbling over it. It was a huge series of blasts, according to people who were in Beirut. A friend of mine in the city said it was the most powerful she had heard in any of Lebanon’s wars. As rescue workers searched among the rubble, Hezbollah remained silent on the fate of their leader - before confirming his death on Saturday afternoon. FOLLOW LIVE: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah killed It will reinforce Israel's belief that this is their greatest triumph yet against their great enemy. They have mobilised more soldiers, and seem to want to pick up the pace. They may even be thinking about a ground incursion into Lebanon. It is a massively escalatory action. Over the last eleven months there has been an ongoing tit-for-tat between both sides, though with more pressure from the Israelis. But now they have decided they are going to push. They will be delighted with what they have done because – unlike the war against Hamas, which they did not expect – they have been planning this war since 2006. They are now putting those plans into effect. There are now huge challenges for Hezbollah. Their rockets landed again in Israeli territory on Saturday morning, targeting areas further south, so they are pushing back, but this is an uncertain period. That uncertainty is part of the danger. The predictability of the war of attrition that went on for months and months meant people knew where they were - they absolutely do not now. Earlier on Friday there had been hopes, admittedly faint ones, that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at least prepared to discuss a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. It came from the US and France and was backed by Israel’s most significant Western allies. But in a typically defiant and at times aggressive speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu did not talk about diplomacy. Israel, he said, had no choice but to fight savage enemies who sought its annihilation. Hezbollah would be defeated – and there would be total victory over Hamas in Gaza, which would ensure the return of Israeli hostages. Far from being lambs led to the slaughter – a phrase sometimes used in Israel to refer to the Nazi Holocaust – Israel, he said, was winning. Explained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Watch: Hezbollah rockets hit residential areas in IsraelAnalysis: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy The huge attack in Beirut that occurred as he finished his speech was an even more emphatic sign that a truce in Lebanon was not on Israel’s agenda. It seemed more than feasible that the attack was timed to follow up Mr Netanyahu’s threats that Israel could, and would, hit its enemies, wherever they were. The Pentagon, the US defence department, said it had no advance warning from Israel about the raid. A photo released by the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem showed him at a bank of communications equipment in what looked like his hotel in New York City. The image’s caption said it showed the moment that he authorised the raid. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the policy he has worked on for months. He said there was still room for negotiation. That assertion is looking hollow. The Americans have very few levers to use against any side. They cannot, by law, talk to Hezbollah and Hamas as they are classified as foreign terrorist organisations. With the US elections only weeks away, they are even less likely to put pressure on Israel than they have been in the last year. Powerful voices in the Israeli government and military wanted to attack Hezbollah in the days after the Hamas attacks last October. They argued that they could deal their enemies in Lebanon a decisive blow. The Americans persuaded them not to do it, arguing that the trouble it might set off across the region offset any potential security benefit for Israel. But in the course of the last year Netanyahu has made a habit of defying President Joe Biden’s wishes about the way Israel is fighting. Despite providing Israel with the aircraft and bombs used in the raid on Beirut, President Biden and team were spectators. His policy for the last year, as a lifelong supporter of Israel, was to try to influence Netanyahu by showing solidarity and support, delivering weapons and diplomatic protection. Biden believed that he could persuade Netanyahu not just to change the way Israel fights – the president has said repeatedly that it is imposing too much suffering and killing too many Palestinian civilians – but to accept an American plan for the day after that rested on creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu rejected the idea out of hand and has ignored Joe Biden’s advice. After the attack on Beirut, Blinken repeated his view that a combination of deterrence and diplomacy had staved off a wider war in the Middle East. But as events spiral out of US control, he is not sounding convincing. Big decisions lie ahead. First of all, Hezbollah is going to have to decide how to use its remaining arsenal. Do they try to mount a much heavier attack on Israel? If they don’t use their remaining rockets and missiles in storage, they might decide Israel will get around to destroying even more of them. The Israelis also face highly consequential decisions. They have already talked about a ground operation against Lebanon, and while they haven’t yet mobilised all the reserves they might need, their military said on Saturday that they were “ready for a wider escalation”. Some in Lebanon believe that in a ground war Hezbollah could negate some of Israel’s military strengths. Western diplomats, among them Israel’s staunchest allies, were hoping to calm matters, urging Israel to accept a diplomatic solution. They will now be looking at events with dismay and also a sense of powerlessness.",Bowen: West left powerless as Israel claims its biggest victory yet against Hezbollah,Bowen: West left powerless as Israel claims its biggest victory yet against Hezbollah,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgn5xkp3rko,articles/article_2898.txt,results/article_2898.txt.json
2899,2024-10-06 17:46:57.114000+00:00,/news/articles/c781vgy3918o,"Millions of people in the Middle East dream of safe, quiet lives without drama and violent death. The last year of war, as bad as any in the region in modern times, has shown yet again that dreams of peace cannot come true while deep political, strategic and religious fault lines remain unbridged. Once again, war is reshaping the politics of the Middle East. The Hamas offensive came out of well over a century of unresolved conflict. After Hamas burst through the thinly defended border, it inflicted the worst day the Israelis had suffered. Around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, phoned President Joe Biden and told him that “We’ve never seen such savagery in the history of the state”; not “since the Holocaust. ” Israel saw the attacks by Hamas as a threat to its existence. Since then, Israel has inflicted many terrible days on the Palestinians in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 people, mostly civilians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Much of Gaza is in ruins. Palestinians accuse Israel of genocide. The war has spread. Twelve months after Hamas went on the offensive the Middle East is on the edge of an even worse war; wider, deeper, even more destructive. A year of killing has stripped away layers of assumptions and illusions. One is Benjamin Netanyahu’s belief that he could manage the Palestinian issue without making concessions to their demands for self-determination. With that went the wishful thinking that had comforted Israel’s worried Western allies. Leaders in the US and UK, and others, had convinced themselves that Netanyahu, despite opposing a Palestinian state alongside Israel all his political life, could somehow be persuaded to accept one to end the war. Netanyahu’s refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology. It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan. President Biden’s “grand bargain” proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence. The Saudis would be rewarded with a security pact with the US. The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle. Netanyahu said in February that statehood would be “huge reward” for Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of the ultra-nationalist extremists in his cabinet, said it would be an “existential threat” to Israel. Latest coverage as Israel strikes Gaza and BeirutIsraeli kibbutz struggles to heal, one year after 7 OctoberGaza Strip in maps: How life in the territory has been upendedJournalists from across the BBC reflect on the year-long warNew accounts reveal how one military base was overrun The Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, presumed to be alive, somewhere in Gaza had his own illusions. A year ago, he must have hoped that the rest of Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance” would join, with full force, into a war to cripple Israel. He was wrong. Sinwar kept his plans to attack Israel on 7 October so secret that he took his enemy by surprise. He also surprised some on his own side. Diplomatic sources told the BBC that Sinwar might not even have shared his plans with his own organisation’s exiled political leadership in Qatar. They had notoriously lax security protocols, talking on open lines that could be easily overheard, one source said. Far from going on the offensive, Iran made it clear it did not want a wider war, as Israel invaded Gaza and President Biden ordered American carrier strike groups to move closer to protect Israel. Instead, Hassan Nasrallah, and his friend and ally, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, restricted themselves to rocketing Israel’s northern border, which they said would continue until a ceasefire in Gaza. The targets were mostly military, but Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people away from the border. In Lebanon, perhaps twice as many had to flee over the months as Israel hit back. Israel made clear it would not tolerate an indefinite war of attrition with Hezbollah. Even so, the conventional wisdom was that Israel would be deterred by Hezbollah’s formidable fighting record in previous wars and its arsenal of missiles, provided by Iran. In September, Israel went on the offensive. No one outside the senior ranks of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Mossad spy agency believed so much damage could be inflicted so quickly on Iran’s most powerful ally. Israel remotely exploded booby-trapped pagers and radios, destroying Hezbollah’s communications and killing leaders. It launched one of the most intense bombing campaigns in modern warfare. On its first day Israel killed about 600 Lebanese people, including many civilians. The offensive has blown a big hole in Iran’s belief that its network of allies cemented its strategy to deter and intimidate Israel. The key moment came on 27 September, with the huge air strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah and many of his top lieutenants. Nasrallah was a vital part of Iran’s “axis of resistance”, its informal alliance and defence network of allies and proxies. Israel broke out of the border war by escalating to a bigger one. If the strategic intention was to force Hezbollah to cease fire and pull back from the border, it failed. The offensive, and invasion of south Lebanon, has not deterred Iran. Iran seems to have concluded that its open reluctance to risk a wider war was encouraging Israel to push harder. Hitting back was risky, and guaranteed an Israeli response, but for the supreme leader and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, it had become the least bad option. On Tuesday 1 October, Iran attacked Israel with ballistic missiles. ___ Kibbutz Kfar Aza is very close to the wire that was supposed to protect Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip. The kibbutz was a small community, with modest homes on an open-plan campus of lawns and neat gardens. Kfar Aza was one of Hamas’s first targets on 7 October. Sixty-two people from the kibbutz were killed by Hamas. Of the 19 hostages taken from there into Gaza, two were killed by Israeli troops after they escaped from captivity. Five hostages from Kfar Aza are still in Gaza. The Israeli army took journalists into Kfar Aza on 10 October last year, when it was still a battle zone. We saw Israeli combat troops dug into the fields around the kibbutz and could hear gunfire as they cleared buildings where they suspected Hamas fighters might be sheltering. Israeli civilians killed by Hamas were being carried out in body bags from the ruins of their homes. Hamas fighters killed by Israeli soldiers as they fought their way into the kibbutz still lay on the neat lawns, turning black as they decomposed in the strong Mediterranean sun. A year later the dead are buried but very little has changed. The living have not returned to live in their homes. Ruined houses have been preserved as they were when I saw them on 10 October last year, except the names and photos of the people who lived and were killed inside them are displayed on big posters and memorials. Zohar Shpak, a resident who survived the attack with his family, showed us round the homes of neighbours who were not as lucky. One of the houses had a large photo on its wall of the young couple who lived there, both killed by Hamas on 7 October. The ground around the houses has been dug over. Zohar said the young man’s father had spent weeks sifting earth to try to find his son’s head. He had been buried without it. The stories of the dead of 7 October, and the hostages, are well known in Israel. Local media still talk about their country’s losses, adding new information to old pain. Zohar said it was too early to think about how they might rebuild their lives. “We are still inside the trauma. We are not in post-trauma. Like people said, we're still here. We are still in the war. We wanted the war will be ended, but we want it will be ended with a victory, but not an army victory. Not a war victory. “My victory is that I could live here, with my son and daughter, with my grandchildren and living peacefully. I believe in peace. ”Zohar and many other Kfar Aza residents identified with the left wing of Israeli politics, meaning that they believed Israel’s only chance of peace was allowing the Palestinians their independence. Israelis like Zohar and his neighbours are convinced that Netanyahu is a disastrous prime minister who bears a heavy responsibility for leaving them vulnerable and open to attack on 7 October. But Zohar does not trust the Palestinians, people he used to ferry to hospitals in Israel in better times when they were allowed out of Gaza for medical treatment. “I don't believe those people who are living over there. But I want the peace. I want to go to Gaza's beach. But I don't trust them. No, I don't trust any one of them. ” Hamas leaders do not accept that the attacks on Israel were a mistake that brought the wrath of Israel, armed and supported by the United States down on to the heads of their people. Blame the occupation, they say, and its lust for destruction and death. In Qatar, an hour or so before Iran attacked Israel on 1 October, I interviewed Khalil al-Hayya, the most senior Hamas leader outside Gaza, second only in their organisation to Yahya Sinwar. He denied his men had targeted civilians – despite overwhelming evidence – and justified the attacks by saying it was necessary to put the plight of the Palestinians on the world’s political agenda. “It was necessary to raise an alarm in the world to tell them that here there is a people who have a cause and have demands that must be met. It was a blow to Israel, the Zionist enemy. ” Israel felt the blow, and on 7 October, as the IDF was rushing troops to the Gaza border, Benjamin Netanyahu made a speech promising a “mighty vengeance”. He set out war aims of eliminating Hamas as a military and political force and bringing the hostages home. The prime minister continues to insist that “total victory” is possible, and that force will in the end free the Israelis held by Hamas for a year. His political opponents, including relatives of the hostages, accuse him of blocking a ceasefire and a hostage deal to appease ultra-nationalists in his government. He is accused of putting his own political survival before the lives of Israelis. Netanyahu has many political enemies in Israel, even though the offensive in Lebanon has helped repair his poll numbers. He remains controversial but for most Israelis the war in Gaza is not. Since 7 October, most Israelis have hardened their hearts to the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Two days into the war, Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said he had ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed… We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. ”Since then, under international pressure, Israel has been forced to loosen its blockade. At the United Nations at the end of September, Netanyahu insisted Gazans have all the food they need. The evidence shows clearly that is not true. Days before his speech, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration, external just demanding an end to “appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”. ""More than 2 million Palestinians are without protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel – the basic necessities to survive. Families have been forcibly displaced, time and time again, from one unsafe place to the next, with no way out. "" BBC Verify has analysed the condition of Gaza after a year of war. The Hamas-run health ministry says nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed so far. Analysis of satellite imagery by US academics Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek suggests 58.7% of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. But there is another human cost - displacement - with civilians repeatedly instructed to move by the IDF. The effects of the movement of people can be seen from space. Satellite images show how tents have amassed and dispersed in central Rafah. It's a pattern that has been repeated across the strip. These waves of displacement began on 13 October, when the IDF told residents of the northern half of the strip to move south for their own ""safety"". BBC Verify has identified more than 130 social media posts like these shared by the IDF, detailing which areas were designated combat zones, routes to take out and where temporary pauses in fighting would take place. In total, these often-overlapping posts amounted to about 60 evacuation orders covering more than 80% of the Gaza strip. On many of the notices, BBC Verify has found key details to be unreadable and drawn boundaries inconsistent with the text. The IDF has designated a coastal area – al-Mawasi - in southern Gaza as a humanitarian zone. It still gets bombed. BBC Verify has analysed footage of 18 air strikes within the zone’s borders. ___ Satellite pictures show a huge bottleneck of people on Salah al-Din Street, after Israel ordered the effective depopulation of northern Gaza. Somewhere in the crowds moving down Salah al-Din, Gaza’s main north-south route, was Insaf Hassan Ali, her husband and two children, a boy of 11 and a girl of seven. So far, they have all survived, unlike many members of their extended family. Israel does not allow journalists into Gaza to report freely. We assume that is because Israel does not want us to see what it has done there. We commissioned a trusted Palestinian freelancer inside Gaza to interview Insaf Ali and her son. She spoke about the terrible fear they felt as they walked south, with perhaps one million others, on the orders of the Israeli army. Death was everywhere, she says. “We were walking on Salah al-Din Street. A car in front of us was hit. We saw it, and it was burning… On the left, people were killed, and on the right, even the animals—donkeys were thrown around, they were bombed. “We said, ‘That’s it, we’re done. ’ We said, ‘now the rocket that is coming will be for us’. ” Insaf and her family had a comfortable middle-class life before the war. Since then, they have been displaced 15 times on the orders of Israel. Like millions of others, they are destitute, often hungry, living in a tent at al-Mawasi, a desolate area of sand dunes. Snakes, scorpions and venomous giant worms invade the tents and have to be swept out. As well as the risk of death in an air strike, they face hunger, disease and the faecal dust generated when millions of people do not have access to proper sanitation. Insaf wept for her old life, and the people they have lost. “Our lives were beautiful, and suddenly we had nothing—no clothes, no food, no essentials for life.  Constantly being displaced is incredibly hard on my children's health. They’ve had malnutrition and they have been infected with diseases, including amoebic dysentery and hepatitis. ”Insaf said that the beginning of months of Israeli bombing felt like the “horrors of judgement day”. “Any mother would feel the same, anyone who owns something precious and is afraid it might slip from their hands at any moment. Each time we moved to a house, it would be bombed, and someone in our family would be killed. ” The only chance of making even small improvements in the lives of Insaf and her family and well over two million others in Gaza is to agree a ceasefire. If the killing stops, diplomats might have a window to stop the slide into a much wider catastrophe. More disasters await in the future, if the war drags on and a new generation of Israelis and Palestinians cannot shake the hatred and horror many currently feel about the actions of the other side. Insaf’s 11-year-old son, Anas Awad, has been deeply affected by everything he has seen. “There’s no future for Gaza’s children. The friends I used to play with have been martyred. We used to run around together. May God have mercy on them. The mosque where I used to memorise the Quran has been bombed. My school has been bombed. So has the playground… everything has gone. I want peace. I wish I could return with my friends and play again. I wish we had a house, not a tent. ”“I don’t have friends anymore. Our whole life has turned to sand. When I go out to the prayer area, I feel anxious, and hesitant. I don’t feel right. ”His mother was listening. “It has been the hardest year of my life. We saw sights we should not have seen – scattered bodies, the desperation of a grown man holding a bottle of water to drink for his children. Of course, our homes are no longer homes; they are just piles of sand, but we hope for the day when we can return. ’ UN humanitarian agencies have condemned both Israel and Hamas: “The parties’ conduct over the last year makes a mockery of their claim to adhere to international humanitarian law and the minimum standards of humanity that it demands. ”  Both sides deny accusations they have broken the laws of war.  Hamas claims it ordered its men not to kill Israeli civilians. Israel says it warns Palestinian civilians to get out of harm’s way but Hamas uses them as human shields. Israel has been referred to the International Court of Justice, accused by South Africa of genocide. The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court has applied for arrest warrants on a range of war crimes charges for Yahya Sinwar of Hamas, and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. For Israelis the Hamas attacks on 7 October were a painful reminder of centuries of pogroms against Jews in Europe that culminated in the genocide carried out by Nazi Germany. In the first month of the war, the Israeli writer and former politician Avraham Burg explained the profound psychological impact on his country. “We, the Jews,” he told me, “we believe that the state of Israel is the first and best immune system and protective system versus Jewish history. No more pogroms, no more Holocaust, no more mass murderers. And all of a sudden, all of it is back. ”Ghosts of the past tormented Palestinians as well. Raja Shehadeh, the celebrated Palestinian writer and human rights campaigner believes that Israel wanted to make another Nakba – another catastrophe: in his latest book What Does Israel Fear From Palestine? he writes “as the war progressed I could see that they meant every word and did not care about civilians, including children. In their eyes, as well as the eyes of most Israelis, all Gazans were guilty”. No one can doubt Israel’s determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the United States. It is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that Palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an Israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence. After generations of conflict Israelis and Palestinians are used to confronting each other. But they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. When a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace. But that is a more distant future. The rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the White House, are uncertain and full of danger. For months after Hamas attacked Israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. Slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after Israel’s devastating attacks on Hezbollah and Lebanon. It is too late to say the Middle East is on the brink. Israel is facing off against Iran.  The warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge. As I write Israel has still not retaliated for Iran’s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. It has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. President Biden and his administration, Israel’s constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer Iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster. The proximity of the US elections, along with Joe Biden’s steadfast support for Israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the US will somehow finesse a way out. The signals from Israel indicate that Netanyahu, Gallant, the generals of the IDF and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. October 7th was a disaster for them. All the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. They had not planned for a war with Hamas. But planning for the war with Hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for Israel. Hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover. So far Israel’s victories are tactical. To get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. Hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. Taking on Israeli infantry and tanks now that south Lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of Israel’s advantages in air power and intelligence. If Iran answers Israel’s retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. In Iraq, Iran’s client militias could attack American interests. Two Israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from Iraq. Saudi Arabia is also looking on nervously. Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman has made clear his view of the future. He would contemplate recognising Israel, but only if the Palestinians get a state in return and Saudi Arabia gets a security pact with the United States. Joe Biden’s role, simultaneously trying to restrain Israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the Americans to getting involved in a wider war with Iran. They don’t want that to happen, but Biden has pledged that he will come to Israel’s aid if it becomes necessary. Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and the damage done to Iran’s strategy and its “axis of resistance” is fostering a new set of illusions among some in Israel and the United States. The dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle East by force, imposing order and neutering Israel’s enemies. Joe Biden – and his successor – should be wary of that. The last time that restructuring the Middle East by force was contemplated seriously was after al-Qaeda’s 9/11 attacks on America, when US President George W Bush and Tony Blair, the UK’s prime minister, were getting ready to invade Iraq in 2003. The invasion of Iraq did not purge the Middle East of violent extremism. It made matters worse. The priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. This year of war started in Gaza. Perhaps it can end there too.

Due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the UK Foreign Office earlier this week urged Britons to leave the Middle East country as quickly as possible. Mahasen al-Dada, who moved to Lebanon from Manchester in 2023, said her husband could not leave because he had to care for his disabled father. She was able to return to the UK on Wednesday with her children on a government-chartered flight from Beirut to Birmingham. Mrs al-Dada, a psychology and criminology graduate, told the BBC her emotions were ""all over the place"" after the couple decided she would leave. She said they made the decision for the safety and future of their children who were no longer able to go to school because of the worsening security situation. ""I've been crying for two days,"" she said. ""The children were crying and asking me questions I couldn't even answer.

It comes after Hezbollah launched rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"" as fighting continues. Mrs al-Dada said she was notified that a flight was available on Monday but had to wait until the following day for seats to be confirmed. ""We're doing well now my kids are feeling a little bit better. They're less stressed now,"" she said. ""My mum was so happy we're back. My dad hasn't been sleeping. He was up watching the news and ringing to check we're ok. ""She said she hopes her husband may be able to join the family in the UK soon. She said he applied for a visa on Wednesday and a note has been placed on his file to show he has a family in the UK. Mrs al-Dada said he was initially hesitant to leave his parents and siblings behind, but seeing how upset their children were changed his mind. ""He got really emotional and I think it changed his mind,"" she said. ""He said he just wants to visit, even if it means he'll be coming here and going back.

2901,2024-08-22 11:02:31.374000+00:00,/news/articles/cq827855x5vo,"The brother of a British-Israeli man killed by Hamas has accused the SNP of double standards in its stance on Israel. Bernard Cowan, originally from Glasgow, was killed by Hamas gunmen in his home on a kibbutz in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack. The 57-year-old left his family in Scotland when he was just 19 to move to Israel. Then first minister Humza Yousaf was widely praised after he embraced Mr Cowan's grieving mother during a visit to Giffnock Newton Mearns Synagogue in East Renfrewshire a few days after his death.  Mr Cowan's brother, Colin Cowan, said he now believed Mr Yousaf had merely used the meeting with his mother as a photo opportunity and questioned how sincere he has been in his comments at the time. He also said he had been angered by criticism of External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson, who apologised after meeting an Israeli diplomat earlier this month. Mr Cowan said Scottish Jews wanted First Minister John Swinney to acknowledge the “legitimate fears” of the community and to meet them. An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism, and the first minister said he would be grateful for the opportunity to meet Mr Cowan and his family. Mr Robertson was heavily criticised by several senior members of his own party - including former SNP ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - after he met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK Daniela Grudsky on 8 August. Mr Robertson subsequently said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He said the Scottish government would not accept further invitations to meet Israeli diplomats until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace and humanitarian assistance, and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"". The SNP also withdrew the party whip from MSP John Mason over social media posts in which he questioned whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. That equates to about 1.7% of the 2.3 million population of the territory, with satellite image analysis suggesting nearly 60% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. Mr Cowan said he believed Israel was being ""targeted"" as the Scottish government had met with representatives from other countries with ""terrible civil rights"" such as Turkey. ""Israel is the only Jewish state in the world,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""The definition of antisemitism is prejudice against Jewish people. ""So if the Scottish government aren’t willing to talk to Israel, is that not being prejudiced against Jewish people?""Why is it that Israel is being targeted when every other Western country is quite happy to talk to Israel? If you want a balanced, impartial view, you should meet with both sides. "" Speaking at the service on 12 October at the Giffnock Newton Mearns Synogogue at which he met Mr Cowan's mother, Mr Yousaf said he stood in solidarity with Scotland’s Jewish community. He added: ""I want you to know that this first minister, who is proudly Muslim, shares the pain of our Jewish communities. ""Your heartbreak is my heartbreak. Your loss is my loss. Your tears are my tears. ""Mr Yousaf has been a vocal critic of the Israeli military action in Gaza, which says has gone ""way beyond a legitimate response"" and has been ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"". Mr Cowan said he now believed Mr Yousaf had used the service at the synogogue as a ""photo opportunity"" and questioned how genuine he had been. “At the time, it seemed quite genuine,"" he said. ""But some of what he said recently, it doesn't seem so genuine anymore. It seems a bit biased, what he did at the time. ” Mr Yousaf said his thoughts were with all of the families impacted by the 7 October attack, as well as families in Gaza ""who have been devastated by Israel’s horrendous actions"". He said: “When I participated in the service of solidarity at Giffnock Shul in October last year, it was at a time of extreme personal grief as my in-laws continued to be trapped in a warzone in Gaza, not knowing whether they would live or die day-by-day. ""My commitment to the Jewish community then, and now, is to be an ally in the face of antisemitism, and I am proud of my lifelong campaigning against hatred in all of its forms, and believe that Islamaphobia and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin. ""But he said that criticism of the actions of the government of Israel was not antisemitism. “While I support diplomacy, even with countries we fundamentally disagree with, there must be limits,"" he said. ""That is why I support the Scottish government ensuring there are not normal diplomatic relationships with the government of Israel until they comply with their international obligations and cease killing civilians with impunity. ” Mr Cowan said he had noticed a spike in antisemitism since the escalation between Israel and Gaza following the 7 October attacks. ""I’ve never felt so unsafe in Scotland as I have in the last year,"" he said. ""Walking down the street, would I be targeted if they knew I was Jewish? It’s definitely an unsafe feeling at the moment. ""There have been numerous incidents of buildings being attacked, people being attacked since 7 October. The Palestinian support that we see, the protests on a weekly basis, makes us feel unsafe. ""He told BBC Scotland that his relatives living in Israel had been displaced amid the ongoing violence. ""They’re not living in their home, they’re living somewhere else,"" he said. ""They are distraught. They’ve lost a father, husband, grandfather, we’ve lost a brother, my mum’s lost a son. It’s hard. ""It’s not easy when someone so young is taken. We’re still reeling from it. ”An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism. They said: ""Following last year’s horrific attacks by Hamas, SNP policy has been consistent and clear that hostages must be released, an immediate ceasefire must be put in place and that a viable Palestine state must be recognised within a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live alongside each other in peace. ”",Brother of Hamas victim accuses SNP of double standards on Israel,Brother of Hamas victim accuses SNP of double standards on Israel,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq827855x5vo,articles/article_2901.txt,results/article_2901.txt.json

It follows a post, external Mr Lewis wrote on X, in which he claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called “rising Islamophobia” in the UK. The co-director of the Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) group has described the comment as ""incendiary"" and ""inflammatory"". Mr Lewis declined to comment. A Labour spokesperson said: “All complaints are treated seriously and thoroughly assessed in line with our rules and procedures. ”In the post on Saturday, Mr Lewis, who is the MP for Norwich South, shared a link to a report , externalin the Guardian newspaper. The article said dozens of people had been reported dead following an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza. Alongside the link, Mr Lewis wrote: “The link between the daily inhumanity being (sic) metted out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. “The inhumanity being shown to one is giving ‘permission’ for the other. These actions diminish us all. ” Alex Hearn is the co-director of LAAS, external, which was started by Labour members to combat what they saw as the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party. He said he had written to the Labour Party, calling for Mr Lewis to be suspended. “I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have. “In my opinion this is conspiracy fantasy. It’s extremely irresponsible that a Labour official should be pouring fuel on the fire in this way. ” Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. The unrest followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Mr Hearn said: “I think his [Mr Lewis’s] comments are dangerous because it’s a fantasy that blames racism against Muslims on Jews thousands of miles away in a different country. “When communities are attacking each other it’s awful. What our officials should be doing is calming things down. Mr Lewis took part in an anti-racism protest in Norwich on Saturday, in which up to 400 people gathered in the city centre. The demonstration was organised as part of a national day of protest by Norwich Stand Up to Racism and Protest with PrideMr Lewis addressed the crowd, three days after attending another counter-protest near a hotel housing asylum seekers on the outskirts of Norwich. A spokesperson for the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, was questioned by the BBC about Mr Lewis's comments. They said it was ""explicitly clear that violence has no place in UK society"". When asked if Mr Lewis's comments were antisemitic, they said it was not their role to get into individual discipline. They added: ""The UK’s position is that we must have more aid into Gaza.

2903,2024-08-03 17:43:56.379000+00:00,/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,"Several countries have urged their nationals to leave Lebanon, as fears grow of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Iran has vowed “severe” retaliation against Israel, which it blames for the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented. His assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response. Diplomatic efforts by the US and other Western countries continue to try to de-escalate tensions across the region. A growing number of flights have been cancelled or suspended at the country’s only commercial airport in Beirut. The US, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Fears of an escalation of hostilities that could engulf Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its attacks on Israel, a day after the deadly Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in support for Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the violence has been contained to border areas, with both sides indicating not being interested in a wider conflict. Hezbollah, however, has vowed to respond to Shukr’s assassination, which happened in Dahiyeh, the group’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs. It came after 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Israel said Shukr was behind it. Meanwhile there has been continuing firing between the two sides. Hezbollah said it launched drones at a military barracks in Ayelet HaShahar, northern Israel, in the early hours of Monday morning. The Israeli military said two soldiers were wounded. It came a day after Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at the nearby town of Beit Hillel. There were no reports of casualties from that attack. Israel’s air force responded by striking targets in southern Lebanon. A Hezbollah fighter and a paramedic were killed in a strike on the town of Mays al-Jabal, less than a mile from the border with Israel. In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The attacker, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, was later “neutralised”, police said. Also on Sunday, officials from the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza said an Israeli air strike had hit a tent inside a hospital, killing at least five people. The officials said 19 Palestinians had been killed across the day.  In a statement on Saturday, the US embassy in Beirut said those who chose to stay in Lebanon should “prepare contingency plans” and be prepared to “shelter in place for an extended period of time”. The Pentagon has said it is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, a strategy similar to the one adopted in April, when Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria. It blamed Israel for that strike. Many fear Iran’s retaliation on this occasion could take a similar form. The UK says it is sending extra military personnel, consular staff and border force officials to help with any evacuations. It has urged UK citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights are running. Two British military ships are already in the region and the Royal Air Force has put transport helicopters on standby. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the regional situation “could deteriorate rapidly”. In a phone call with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Friday, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran would ""undoubtedly use its inherent and legitimate right"" to ""punish"" Israel. On Friday, an announcer on Iran's state TV warned ""the world would witness extraordinary scenes"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead. . . We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Tensions escalated after a rocket strike on a football pitch in the occupied Golan Heights killed 12 children and teenagers. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, Shukr, who was a close adviser to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh's assassination dealt a blow to the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, the main hope to defuse tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow,Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,articles/article_2903.txt,results/article_2903.txt.json
2904,2024-09-26 21:39:32.981000+00:00,/news/articles/cz04depp2nro,"After the US, the EU and 10 other counties called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the White House went into spin mode trying to build momentum for its proposal. On a late night Zoom briefing so packed with reporters that some had to be turned away, senior Biden administration officials described the announcement as a “breakthrough”. What they meant was they saw getting an agreement from key European countries and Arab states, led by Washington, as a big diplomatic achievement during the current explosive escalationBut this was world powers calling for a ceasefire - not a ceasefire itself. Explained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Watch: What satellite data shows about rocket damage in LebanonAnalysis: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemyWatch: Deserted streets in Israel's border towns The statement urges both Israel and Hezbollah to stop fighting now, using a 21-day truce, “to provide space” for further mediated talks. It then urges a diplomatic settlement consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 -  adopted to end the last Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, which was never properly implemented. It also calls for agreement on the stalled Gaza ceasefire deal. Beyond the three-week truce, it packages up a series of already elusive regional objectives. Some have remained out of reach for diplomats for nearly two decades already. To issue the agreed upon text, the Americans had the advantage of world leaders gathered in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. But what the “breakthrough” did not mean - as it has become abundantly clear on the ground - was that Israel and Hezbollah had reached an agreement. Here, it seemed like US officials were trying to present the position of the two sides as more advanced than it really was - likely an attempt to build public momentum behind the plan and to pressure both sides. Asked whether Israel and Hezbollah were onboard, one of the senior officials said: “I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment based on the [ceasefire] call, based on our discussion - and they are familiar with the text… We'll let them speak to their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours. ”Pressed again on whether this meant Israel and Hezbollah had signed on - especially given the fact that the US does not have direct contact with Hezbollah - the official clarified that the US had talked intensively about the text with Israeli officials and with Lebanon's government (meaning its officials would have contact with Hezbollah). “Our expectation is when the government of Lebanon and when the government of Israel both accept this, this will carry and to be implemented as a ceasefire on both sides,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That sounded pretty promising. But after the late-night call, the diplomats woke to news of more Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, including in Beirut, and more Hezbollah rocket fire into Israel. This week has seen Lebanon’s bloodiest day since its civil war; Israeli airstrikes killed more than 600 people including 50 children, according to Lebanese health officials. So how significant is the diplomacy, and can it actually lead to a ceasefire?The early signs don’t bode well. The office of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, as he boarded a flight to New York for his UN speech on Friday, issued a defiant statement saying he hadn’t agreed to anything yet. It added that he ordered Israeli military to continue fighting with “full force”. Lebanon’s prime minister Najib Mikati dismissed reports that he signed on to the proposed ceasefire, saying they were “entirely untrue”. Instead, the joint statement creates a baseline position for the international community to try to exert pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to pull back and stop. More work will be done in New York before the week is up. And it likely will  continue afterwards. It is significant that the Americans, leading the charge along with the French, have used the words “immediate ceasefire”. After 7 October, the US for months actively blocked resolutions from the UN Security Council calling for such a ceasefire in Gaza, until President Biden unexpectedly used the word and the US position shifted. Since then, intensive diplomacy led by Washington has failed to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, with the US currently blaming a lack of “political will” by Hamas and Israel. Meanwhile, the US has continued to arm Israel. That doesn’t inspire confidence that Washington and its allies can now strong-arm Israel and Hezbollah into a quick truce, especially given the fighting on the ground, the intensity of Israel’s air strikes and last week’s explosive pager attacks on Hezbollah, which has continued to fire into Israel. On the other hand, the difference between this and the Gaza ceasefire is that the Israel-Lebanon agreement doesn’t involve hostage negotiations, which contributed to the deadlock over a Gaza deal. But the objectives for each side are still very significant. Israel wants to be able to return 60,000 displaced residents from the north and maintain security there free from Lebanon's daily rocket fire. Hezbollah seeks to stop Israeli strikes on Lebanon where more than 90,000 people also are displaced from the south. The Shia militant group will aim to maintain its dominance in the country and its presence in the south while trying to ensure the bloody events of the last week don’t invoke more internal resentment of the group amid Lebanon’s fractious sectarian divisions. Finding agreement between these two sides has already evaded Amos Hochstein, Washington’s envoy on the Israel-Lebanon crisis, for months. And here is where the US-led desire to get an immediate truce gets complicated. My understanding of the negotiations to reach the joint statement is that Washington pushed to make sure it linked the 21-day ceasefire to creating the negotiating time for a longer-term settlement. Namely, that the two sides negotiate to implement Resolution 1701, which implements multiple conditions on Israel and Hezbollah. These include the group’s retreat from a strip of Lebanon south of the Litani River and, in the long term, Hezbollah’s disarmament. Ever since 2006, each side has long accused the other of breaking the terms of 1701. All of this means that an objective, which has already evaded diplomats for nearly two decades, is now being wrapped into the short-term plan for calm between these two sides. As the missiles continue to fall, the current diplomacy is asking a lot.",Can diplomacy bring Middle East ceasefire? Early signs don't bode well ,Can diplomacy bring Middle East ceasefire?

On Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza. Before starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. The MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a ""difficult situation"". Now the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns. The MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance. At Sunday’s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin. Witness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness. In an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said “While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson’s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere. ""“We recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week. ”Mr Gillham has accepted the MSO’s apology. “I hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,” he said in a statement. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. At least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom. The decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling,” later adding that “art is often powerful because it’s political”. Arts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO’s apology, “Not before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent. ”The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage.

Some of those killed were displaced people sheltering at the schools, rescuers said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, saying it had targeted Hamas ""command and control centres"" within two schools in Gaza City. The strikes were the third time in a week schools in Gaza have been hit by Israeli strikes.  The IDF said: ""The schools were used by Hamas's al-Furqan Battalion as a hiding place for its terrorist operatives and as command centres used to plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel. ""Footage on social media purported to show bodies inside one of the schools as rescuers evacuated casualties, including children. Palestinian media said at least 30 people were killed in the strikes. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defence, said most of the dead were women and children. He added that more people were believed to be buried under the rubble. The attack on the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools came on the day of an attack on a camp for displaced people in a hospital in central Gaza, which reportedly killed at least five people. On Saturday, officials said an air strike on Hamama School in Gaza City had killed at least 17 people. Days earlier, a strike on Dalal al-Mughrabi School killed 15, according to officials.

2908,2024-11-28 19:57:34.183000+00:00,/news/articles/c5yg1pq1x57o,"Israel says its forces fired artillery and carried out airstrikes against targets in southern Lebanon, on the second day of a ceasefire brokered after more than a year of war between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah. The Israeli army said it had fired at suspects after spotting activity at a Hezbollah weapons facility, and vehicles arriving in several areas that breached the terms of the ceasefire deal. Lebanon accused Israel of violating the agreement “multiple times” and said it was monitoring the situation. Despite fraying around the edges, so far the ceasefire appears to be largely holding, and the Israeli military road leading to the northern tip of the Lebanese border was sleepier than it has been for months. Through the open gates of bases, soldiers were carrying out routine maintenance, stick figures on the lines of tanks, etched against the late afternoon sky. One captain, who crossed out of Lebanon this morning, told me he and his team were happy to be out of the fighting and going back to their lives – but that they all hoped they had done enough. “If not, we all understand that we’ll find ourselves back here soon enough,” he said. “Personally, I think there’s still work to be done. It’s clear that Hezbollah is still strong enough to threaten Israel. ” Israel’s leaders are signalling their confidence to the public – lifting daily restrictions in some areas, and removing blast walls and makeshift shelters from border roads. Prime Minister Netanyahu has also vowed an ""intensive war"" if Hezbollah violates the ceasefire. There is vocal support from Washington for using this truce as a springboard to a wider regional ceasefire.  And Hamas has reportedly signalled its willingness to talk about a deal along similar lines. But there are many voices here in the north who say the ceasefire with Hezbollah is a mistake, even a “surrender”. One of them is Michael Kabesa, mayor for the northern community of Hatzor Haglilit. “It’s more a surrender agreement than a ceasefire,” he told me. “We didn’t finish the job, we stopped at 70% – so they will grow, restore their abilities, and we will meet again in another 20 years. ”The focus on this side of the border is when and how residents might begin to return to communities that were evacuated at the start of the war, almost 14 months ago. “We need a very safe parameter,” Mayor Kabesa told me. “We need to see the army on the border on a big scale, so it will give us confidence. ”Israeli forces are due to gradually hand over control of southern areas of Lebanon over the next two months, to the Lebanese army, with Unifil support, and oversight from the American military and the French. “The Americans and the French are a really nice addition,” said Mr Kabesa, “but we know that no power, no international force, can enforce the situation.  We need to take care of ourselves – this is the biggest lesson after 7 October. ”The 7 October attacks on Israel last year – carried out by the Palestinian armed group Hamas, a Hezbollah ally in Gaza – have transformed social and political life here. Mayor Kabesa was among the first Israeli soldiers who helped to clear the ravaged kibbutzim around the Gaza border in the early days after the attack. What he saw after the Hamas invasion, he said, has changed his assessment of security in the north. But there are some in these northern communities who have refused to evacuate during almost 14 months of war, staying on in abandoned towns that were regularly hit by Hezbollah rockets and missiles. Chris Coyle, originally from Edinburgh, is one of only four residents left in his apartment complex in Kiryat Shmona. All the windows in his block – and those of the buildings 200m around it – are boarded up, after being blown out when a missile landed in the road outside several months ago. Rockets and missiles landed here several times a day – sometimes several times an hour. Before Israel sent ground forces into Lebanon to push back Hezbollah positions, Chris had four seconds to get to the safe room – it wasn’t enough, so he used to just lie on the kitchen floor, using the fridge door as a shield. “We need a ceasefire,” he told me. “If it holds for a month, we can have some hope. ”For the past year, Kiryat Shmona has been a ghostly empty place, scarred by rockets, where lone soldiers buy off-duty supplies from the few shops still open.

The 32-year-old firefighter and paramedic with the Lebanese Civil Defense Force (CDF) only got a few hours' sleep last night. It is now the middle of the afternoon and he still hasn’t had breakfast. Since the escalation of the war between Israel and the Shia Muslim Hezbollah, the men and women of the CDF see little rest, and brace themselves for a mass casualty incident every day. This article contains graphic descriptionsIt is starkly different from the last war with Israel in 2006, Samir says. “We didn't have those kind of air strikes. Recently, a fire station was hit, and a church in the south, and our humanitarian colleagues have been killed. ” CDF workers say civilians, including women and children, are increasingly among the dead and injured when they attend a call out. The war between Israel and Hezbollah is spreading deeper and wider across Lebanon. An intense bombing campaign has broadened far beyond the country’s southern border villages and the capital Beirut, to towns in the fertile Bekaa and the historic city of Baalbek, principally Shia areas, where Hezbollah was founded. The port cities of Sidon and Tyre have also seen an increase in attacks. Israel says it is only targeting Hezbollah fighters, weapons and infrastructure. Since its campaign against the militant group escalated, Israel estimates it has destroyed two-thirds of Hezbollah’s rocket and missile stockpile. But Hezbollah is still firing rockets daily towards Israel. The BBC spent two weeks with Civil Defense Force crews in the Bekaa Valley, which stretches eastwards to the border with Syria. Permission from Hezbollah was required to visit the scene of Israeli attacks. In that time, the number and frequency of strikes in the area dramatically increased. On 28 October, there were more than 100 Israeli strikes, and in the past week alone 160 people were killed in the Bekaa, according to official figures. The Lebanese government does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures. Samir and his men arrive in the Shia village of El Karak to find chaos and destruction - the air is thick with smoke and dust. Earlier at their station in the nearby city of Zahle, they had heard a powerful explosion - and from their balcony seen a plume of smoke in the distance. They jumped into their fire trucks and ambulances and headed straight there. A woman in chador sits on the pavement begging to be let into the smoking ruins of an apartment block, but men reason with her to stay put. It is too dangerous, a second Israeli air strike could be coming. The first body they find is of a man, blown across the ground by the explosion. There are survivors underneath the pancaked floors of the apartments and Samir goes deep in the rubble. He is not wearing plastic protective gloves as fire is still blazing inside, so when he finds a child, he can feel shattered bones beneath his fingertips. As he carefully retrieves the child, he realises it is only half a body. “The first victim I found was a child. I don't know if it's a girl or a boy,” he tells me afterwards. “Sorry to explain that. But it's from the stomach and up - from stomach and down there is nothing. ”In the past, the CDF crew have received phone calls telling them to evacuate a site they are attending. They assume they are from the Israelis. No such call comes on this day, so for an hour Samir and others dig deeper into the ruin. Eventually they find a 10-year-old girl alive. She tells the rescuers that her eight-month-old brother, Mohammed, was next to her. “After that, we started hearing the screaming of a small child,” Samir says. Through a small crevice in the rubble they spot the trapped boy, trying to move his legs, his babygrow and a single blue sock visible to the rescue crew. They painstakingly remove the debris around him and he is gently cradled in Samir’s hands and brought to safety. Mohammed is now being treated in Iraq for the head injury he suffered, his family says. The CDF works across Lebanon’s sectarian divide. It does not discriminate, says Samir, who is Christian and is the head of operations at the station in Zahle - a predominantly Christian town, dominated by a statue of the Virgin Mary, which rises 54m above a hilltop. “We don't ask the sex of the victim. We don't ask if he's black, white. We don't ask if he's Christian or Muslim. We are humanitarians,” Samir says. The UN estimates that every day in October at least one child was killed and 10 were injured in Israeli attacks. Those losses, combined with those of their colleagues killed in strikes, are taking their toll on Samir and his men. Almost 24 hours after they left the El Karak site, a second Israeli attack brought down the rest of the apartment building. In the early evenings, Hezbollah still fires rockets from nearby hillsides, targeting Israel. One salvo of at least six projectiles causes a brush fire near Zahle. In the town of Khodor, the Hezbollah flag is planted on the ruins of one of the many buildings that have been flattened by Israeli bombs. Children’s toys have been arranged at its base. A large red Shia flag flaps in the wind nearby - it is almost the only sound in the largely abandoned town. With a bandaged head, Jawad Hamzeh takes me through the rubble of his home. His three daughters died in the attack, including 24-year-old Nada who was pregnant. He holds up another daughter’s law books, she was studying to be a lawyer. There were no militants here, he says. “Where are the missiles, do you see them?” he asks. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began attacking Israel on 8 October 2023 in solidarity with its ally Hamas, which had carried out a devastating attack on Israel the day before. Months of cross-border exchanges followed, and then, in late September this year, Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nassrallah, and followed that with a ground invasion. Hezbollah is committed to Israel’s destruction, but it is more than a militant group. It is the most powerful political force in Lebanon and a social movement which serves as a bulwark for Lebanon’s long-discriminated Shia communities against other sects in the country. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced by the year-long war. By attacking Hezbollah on multiple fronts, Israel hopes to degrade the group and let its people return home. Despite US-led ceasefire talks, neither side appears willing to back down. On 30 October, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order in the Bekaa city of Baalbek, which the UN described as the “largest forced movement Lebanon has experienced in a single day” since the start of the conflict. As many as 150,000 people were given only hours to flee another Israeli assault. There, not far from the magnificent Roman ruins with its towering temple of Bacchus, I met Hussein Nassereldine, 42, whose home had been destroyed in an Israeli strike the night before. “No terrorist or bad person lived here,” he says. “All who lived here were decent people. ” He says it was home to families who had fled Beirut in 1982 during the country’s civil war, including his own. “We were born here and lived here, and we will stay and won’t leave here,” he says. As I leave, men with pickaxes and shovels are making slow progress in the rubble and Hussein prepares to erect a tent on what was left of his home. Outside the city, at the Dar Al Amal hospital, the injured are recovering from Baalbek’s deadliest day. Of the 63 people killed, two thirds of those were women and children according to the local governor. Israel says it struck 110 Hezbollah-linked targets. In a bare room, filled only with screams, three-year-old Selin’s tiny hand reaches out for comfort. But there is no-one there. She has burns to her face, a fractured leg and wounds to her groin and side. Her mother, father, two sisters and brother were all killed in the Israeli air strike that left her broken and alone. Across the corridor of the intensive care unit, two-year-old Kayan Smeha has a fractured skull. His mother, Najat, 24, kisses him gently on his cheek and cradles him to quieten him. “He is still panicking,” she tells me. “And he is probably re-running the scene as I am doing. I can handle it, but he is small, he can’t. ”Tears roll down her cheek, but she is defiant. “I’m crying because I am afraid for my baby. But if they think they can break us they are mistaken. If I had to, I will sacrifice my son and my husband, my father, my mother, my sister,” Najat says. “Death of loved ones is hard but not harder than getting humiliated. And we will hold on to our faith and to our traditions till death. ”  At the small CDF station in the village of Ferzoul, between orchards and vineyards, the Sun comes up after a cold night. The seasonal temperature is dropping here and most of Lebanon’s shelters for the displaced are full. Samir arrives and I ask him how he copes with what he has seen. “Some of the pictures are stuck in our head,” he says, adding that they will never go away. He leans heavily on his faith. “When you manage to keep one [person] alive, that will give you the strength to keep going,” he says. “And this is a power that’s given from God and we're going to still do our job. Even if we were directly targeted, we say here in Lebanon, God will keep us safe and we have faith in God and he will keep us safe. ”",Chaos and destruction as Israel strikes deep in Lebanon’s valley,Chaos and destruction as Israel strikes deep in Lebanon’s valley,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c36p55j598lo,articles/article_2909.txt,results/article_2909.txt.json

Safe Haven for Donkeys was set up in Haywards Heath in 2000 with the aim of helping working donkeys in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The charity is funding a mobile first aid team to treat donkeys and horses needing veterinary intervention amid the Israel-Gaza conflict. Chief executive Andy Foxcroft said donkeys had become the main mode of transport in Gaza for humans. With fuel scarce and many vehicles damaged, donkeys and horses are used to transport people and items like water and medicine. However, the animals suffer from malnourishment, dehydration and wounds, the charity said. Mr Foxcroft said the charity were working tirelessly to help the animals. “Our shipment of food and medicines are desperately needed in Gaza,” he said. “The donkeys will only be able to support their owners and the community if they are fed and cared for. ”Since April, the team has treated approximately 800 donkeys and horses. The doctor leading the team, Dr Saif, said a donkey was used to help transport a pregnant woman to hospital. “There was no way for an ambulance or car to take her from home to the hospital, due to the danger involved, so we had to use a donkey. “She had twins in the hospital, and it was a donkey that saved her and her babies’ lives. ” Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.

2913,2024-09-23 17:28:30.184000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y8mlp9jyvo,"It seems hard to believe that it’s less than a week since Hezbollah’s communication devices started exploding all across Lebanon. The days since have represented a series of catastrophic setbacks for the formidable, Iranian-backed Shia militia. With its networks disrupted, its fighting men mutilated, its leadership assassinated and its military infrastructure under constant bombardment, Hezbollah is facing its worst crisis in four decades. Now Israel’s defence minister says the campaign is “deepening”. But it’s a high-risk strategy, in which Hezbollah’s ability to respond cannot be ignored. With alerts constantly sounding across northern Israel, Yoav Gallant has told Israelis to “show composure, discipline and full obedience to the directives of Home Front Command”. We found all on display in equal measure when we visited the small community of Givat Avni,  a short distance west of Tiberias. David Yitzhak showed us where a 120mm rocket tore through the roof of his family home at lunchtime on Monday. With sirens blaring, David bundled his wife and six-year-old daughter into the house’s safe room, seconds before the explosion. “It’s a metre from life to death,” David said, indicating the short distance between the safe room and the hole in his daughter’s bedroom. He said he feels no animosity towards the people of Lebanon, but says Hezbollah started the war for no reason. “So now we are giving back. And it will be OK. ” Live updates: Israel strikes dozens more sites in southern Lebanon'We just had to flee': Fear and tension in LebanonBowen: Israel believes it has weakened Hezbollah but escalation riskyDeadliest day in years for Lebanon as Israel steps up strikes on Hezbollah But Givat Avni is 20 miles (30km) from the Lebanese border, far from the evacuation zone established by the authorities almost a year ago. An hour later, as we arrived at nearby Kibbutz Lavi, home for the past year to families evacuated from further north, sirens sounded once more. Rockets appeared in the sky overhead and as we were ushered into an underground shelter full of children and their artwork, we heard a series of deep resonant booms. An hour later, more alerts, another safe room and more distant explosions. Hezbollah had been firing rockets further into Israel, even before the latest escalation. But now an even larger swathe of northern Israel is in the firing line. All of this is adding a sense of urgency to the government’s actions. Speaking after a meeting with defence chiefs, the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was changing the balance of power in the north. “We are facing complex days,” he warned. “We do not wait for a threat,” he said. “We anticipate it. Anywhere, in any arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles. ”Having seized the initiative, Israel’s military seems determined to keep Hezbollah on the back foot, in the hope of realising the government’s aim of returning civilians to homes evacuated along the northern border. On Monday morning, it stepped up another gear, telling Lebanese villagers to leave places where they believe Hezbollah is concealing its bigger weapons. Military officials showed journalists a video of an air strike in which Israel says it destroyed a modified Russian cruise missile, hidden inside a house. In another “illustration”, we were shown a skeletal 3D mock-up of a village in southern Lebanon, full of concealed weapons and equipment. The mock-up, and the instructions to civilians to leave, all carried echoes of Israel’s efforts to explain its actions in Gaza. But military officials insist that, unlike Gaza, the warnings do not mean that the army is poised to move in on the ground in southern Lebanon. “We are currently focusing on Israel’s aerial campaign only,” a senior official said on Monday. It seems that for now, Israel will see what it can achieve from the air. A former commander, speaking on Israel’s Channel 12, said that so far, the air force had shown only a fraction of its capabilities. But there’s only so much Israel can achieve from the air, even if, as seems possible, jets are about to lay waste to entire villages. At some point, a ground invasion – however limited – seems unavoidable. But would it be wise?“That’s exactly what Hezbollah wants,” Dr Jacques Neria, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Security and Foreign Affairs, told i24 News. “The residents of southern Lebanon are Hezbollah soldiers,” he said. “And therefore we will have to fight against a mass that we do not know, under unfamiliar conditions. ”In his defiant speech last week, Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah dared Israel to attempt to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, something the head of Israel’s Northern Command is said to be pushing for. Such an effort, he said, would have “dire consequences” for Israel. At the moment, there’s no sign of a diplomatic off-ramp. US-led efforts to defuse the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have run into the sand, along with negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages. Cold military logic – strike and counter-strike – appears to have taken over. This is not a battle of equals. Israel knows it can beat Hezbollah. There’s a complete asymmetry in the level of destruction and suffering that each side can inflict on the other. But where the conflict is heading, and how much worse it will get before it ends, is anyone’s guess.",Cold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflict,Cold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflict,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8mlp9jyvo,articles/article_2913.txt,results/article_2913.txt.json
2914,2024-09-05 11:55:16.710000+00:00,/news/articles/ckg5en18qvxo,"Colombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered an investigation into the purchase of Pegasus spy software by the country's police force. President Petro said the spyware was bought - in cash - from an Israeli surveillance firm during the government of his predecessor, Iván Duque. He added that the software, which can be installed remotely on mobile phones to access people's microphones and cameras, may have been used to spy on political rivals, including himself. The president's remarks were the first official confirmation that Colombia was among the countries which bought the phone malware.  Pegasus software infects iPhones and Android devices to enable operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. Mr Petro revealed the news in a televised address to the nation, saying that he had learned of the purchase through a confidential document. The president said that Colombia's police intelligence directorate (Dipol) had made two payments of $5.5m (£4.2m) each to Israeli surveillance firm NSO, which had developed the spyware. NSO has said in the past that its software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. But Mr Petro queried how $11m in cash could have left the country without any trace of it being recorded in the published budget - and why. ""It is a laundering of assets made from our own state to disrupt the communications of whom?"" he asked. Pegasus spyware hit the headlines in 2021 when a list of 50,000 phone numbers of suspected victims of hacking was leaked to major media outlets. Among those believed to have been targeted were activists, journalists and politicians from around the world.  President Petro urged the attorney-general's office to investigate the purchase and what police may have used the spyware for. He also demanded that the head of Colombia's police force hand over all relevant documents related to Pegasus. It is not the first time the Colombian security forces have been accused of illegally intercepting communication. Wiretapping scandals have rocked the country repeatedly over the past two decades, leading to the closure of its intelligence agency, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS), in 2011.

2915,2024-08-15 00:24:21.838000+00:00,/news/articles/cy8431ejnk5o,"Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned from her position, four months after the institution was rocked by campus protests over the war in Gaza. Dr Shafik's resignation comes only a year after she took the position at the private Ivy League university in New York City, and just a few weeks before the autumn semester is due to begin. Dr Shafik is now the third president of an Ivy League university to resign over her handling of Gaza war protests. In April, Dr Shafik authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building. The episode marked the first time that mass arrests had been made on Columbia's campus since Vietnam War protests more than five decades ago. The move inflamed other protests at dozens of colleges across the United States and Canada. In an email to students and faculty on Wednesday, Dr Shafik wrote that she has overseen a ""period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community"". ""This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community. ""Katrina Armstrong, chief executive officer of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, will serve as the interim president. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead,” Dr Shafik wrote in her letter. “I have tried to navigate a path that upholds academic principles and treats everyone with fairness and compassion,” she continued. “It has been distressing - for the community, for me as president and on a personal level - to find myself, colleagues, and students the subject of threats and abuse. ”In a statement, the university's board of trustees co-chairs said: ""Minouche has contributed so much to the Columbia community in an extraordinarily challenging time. """"While we are disappointed to see her leave us, we understand and respect her decision. ""Students' anger over how Israel is fighting its war against Hamas has raised fraught questions for university leaders, who are already struggling with combustive campus debates around what is happening in the Middle East. US college campuses have been a flashpoint for Gaza war protests since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, and Israel's subsequent incursion into the Gaza Strip. The leaders of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology all testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The presidents of Harvard and UPenn ultimately resigned amid backlash over their handling of campus protests and congressional testimony, including their refusal to say that calling for the deaths of Jews could violate university policy. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fierce critic of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on US campuses, welcomed the news on X, formerly Twitter. ""I stood in President Shafik’s office in April and told her to resign, and while it is long overdue, we welcome today’s news,"" he said. ""Jewish students at Columbia beginning this school year should breathe a sigh of relief. ""In April, Dr Shafik defended her institution's efforts to tackle antisemitism to Congress, saying that there had been a rise in such hatred on campus and the college was working to protect students. Dr Shafik is a highly-respected Egyptian-born economist who formerly worked for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. She also previously served as president of the London School of Economics. Dr Shafik, who received a damehood in 2015, was previously considered to be on the shortlist for the Bank of England governor, the BBC reported in 2019. Her letter adds that she has been asked by the UK Foreign Secretary to lead a “review of the government’s approach to international development and how to improve capability”. The decision, she wrote, “enables me to return to the House of Lords and to reengage with the important legislative agenda put forth by the new UK government”. Her resignation comes after three Columbia University deans also resigned last week, after text messages showed the group used ""antisemitic tropes"", according to a statement by Dr Shafik, while discussing Jewish students. The text exchanges were originally published by the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce in early July. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, the chairwoman of the congressional committee, praised the decision by the three administrators to resign. “About time. Actions have consequences,” she said in a statement last Thursday, adding that the decision should have been made “months ago”. “Instead, the University continues to send mixed signals,"" she continued, adding that the administration is allowing a dean who has not resigned to ""slide under the radar with no real consequences”. Universities around the US are preparing for the academic year to begin in the next several weeks, as the conflict in Gaza continues. On Tuesday, a judge in California ruled that UCLA - which saw violent protests break out on campus in May - must prevent protesters from blocking Jewish students from campus facilities. Judge Mark Scarsi ruled that protesters had “established checkpoints and required passers-by to wear a specific wristband to cross them”, and blocking “people who supported the existence of the state of Israel”. “Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” Judge Scarsi wrote in the order. “This fact is so unimaginable and so abhorrent to our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom that it bears repeating. ”The university has blamed outside agitators for the checkpoints and said it objected to the ruling. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war. At least 39,897 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.",Columbia University president resigns after Gaza protests turmoil,Columbia University president resigns after Gaza protests turmoil,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy8431ejnk5o,articles/article_2915.txt,results/article_2915.txt.json
2916,2024-09-03 22:45:05.850000+00:00,/news/articles/cvg3dnn7zlyo,"Columbia University students began the school year with fresh protests and increased security just outside their famous New York City campus. Last term, the Ivy League college saw some of the largest and tensest campus demonstrations in the US as students protested against Israel's military operation in Gaza. On Tuesday, the first day of term, all eyes were on the demonstrators who gathered at the school gates to see whether they would reflect the scale of the earlier protests. Police said there were at least two arrests on Tuesday, but characterised the gatherings as ""peaceful"".  Pro-Palestinian protesters - many of their faces covered in traditional keffiyeh scarves - could be heard several blocks from the site of the demonstration on Tuesday morning. They chanted ""Free Palestine"" as they banged on drums and marched in circles outside Columbia University's famous iron gates. On the other side of metal barricades, students and staff watched the demonstration as they queued up to have their identification thoroughly checked before they could enter campus. Inside, the biggest disruption occurred around noon on Tuesday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The Alma Mater statue outside Low Memorial Library was doused with red paint - allegedly by protesters. The area was reportedly blocked off, as a crew worked to clean the statue. Columbia’s previous academic year concluded with the New York Police Department raiding a pro-Palestinian encampment that had taken over the campus quad. Student protesters then briefly occupied an academic building that police ultimately cleared, leading to more than 100 arrests. The school cancelled its main graduation and the student body left for the summer under a cloud of deep unease. Last month Minouche Shafik  - who served as Columbia's president during the encampment and permitted the police raid - resigned. On Tuesday, the pro-Palestinian protesters asked the returning students to remember why they had demonstrated during the last academic year.  “We ask that you put aside your excitement for a new school year and remember the Palestinians who died by our very dollars,” read a flier that the protesters distributed. Multiple protesters declined the BBC’s interview requests on Tuesday, and participants were generally unwilling to speak to the press. By mid-afternoon, the pro-Palestinian demonstration concluded - though protesters chanted: ""We'll be back. ""Most students on Tuesday appeared unfazed by the demonstrators. Several excitedly greeted each other, hugging after a summer apart. Two students manoeuvred a flatscreen television through protesters and metal security barriers. Stephanie Lee, a 28-year-old graduate student studying business, said she expected there to be protests, but she felt ""OK"" on her first day on campus. “Security is pretty good,"" she added. Rachel Black, a freshman from North Carolina, said that she saw the protests as a welcome part of her overall experience at Columbia University. “I’m interested in becoming more educated,” she said. “I’m hoping to learn what the conflict [is] about. ” Columbia University spokesperson Samantha Slater did not acknowledge the protests in a statement provided to BBC News. ""As we begin the new semester, we are focused on our mission of teaching, creating, and advancing knowledge and ensuring a safe, respectful campus environment for our community. "" Multiple protests and counter-protests have been staged at Columbia University since Hamas’s attack in Israel on 7 October, 2023. The attack left about 1,200 people dead, while 251 people were taken hostage. About 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began a retaliatory military campaign that has drawn international criticism. On Sunday, Israel announced it had recovered the bodies of six of the hostages who were taken to Gaza. Among them was 23-year-old Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose parents waged a public campaign calling for his release. David Lederer, a 22-year-old junior at Columbia University, held a small-counter protest along with a fellow Jewish student outside the university gates on Tuesday.

Jonathan Freedland, Hadley Freeman and David Aaronovitch announced they were quitting their columns over what Freedland described as a ""great disgrace"" at the London-based newspaper. It comes after the JC said it conducted a ""thorough investigation"" into one of its freelance journalists, Elon Perry, ""after allegations were made about aspects of his record"". It said it was ""not satisfied"" with some of the claims made by the writer, and therefore had deleted his articles and ended its association with him. Jonathan Freedland - who described the stories as fabricated - said the JC had shown only the ""thinnest form of contrition"". Hadley Freeman said recent events made it impossible for her to stay, while Aaronovitch said he, too, had left the paper. A statement from a spokesperson for David Baddiel said on Sunday the comedian also had ""no plans to write any more columns for"" for the Jewish Chronicle. JC editor Jake Wallis Simons said on Sunday that he understood, external ""why some columnists have decided to step back from the paper"". ""I am grateful for their contributions and hope that, in time, some of them will feel able to return,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""I take full responsibility for the mistakes that have been made and I will take equal responsibility for the task of making sure nothing like this can happen again. ""Wallis Simons said ""it’s every newspaper editor’s worst nightmare to be deceived by a journalist"". He added: ""Readers can be assured that stronger internal procedures are being implemented. ""Elon Perry told BBC News the JC ""made a huge mistake with its statement"". He said he could not reveal his source to JC editors and described a ""witch-hunt against me caused by jealousy"". Perry describes himself in an online biography, external as having worked as a lecturer and a journalist, as well as ""a commando in the Israeli army, taking part in numerous operations in pursuing terrorists in Gaza, the West Bank, and in Lebanon"". The JC said on Friday, external: ""While we understand he did serve in the Israel Defence Forces, we were not satisfied with some of his claims. We have therefore removed his stories from our website and ended any association with Mr Perry. ""It did not specify which claims it was referring to. In recent months, Perry has written a series of articles for the JC. The most contentious was a piece he wrote claiming a document showed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was planning to smuggle himself and some surviving Israeli hostages out of Gaza and to Iran, via the Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land on the Gaza-Egypt border. The article's claims appeared to be similar to talking points used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to justify the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) presence in the Philadelphi Corridor. The story was followed up by media in Israel, and later shared by Netanyahu's son. According to the Times of Israel, external, the IDF subsequently said it had no knowledge of such a document existing. Freedland - who has written for the JC since 1998 - said his attachment to the paper ""runs very deep"", beginning with his late father who also wrote for it. ""That bond partly explains why I've stuck with it even as it departed from the traditions that built its reputation as the world's oldest Jewish newspaper,"" he wrote on X, external. ""Too often, the JC reads like a partisan, ideological instrument, its judgements political rather than journalistic. ""He also warned that there was ""no real accountability"" because the newspaper is owned ""by a person or people who refuse to reveal themselves"". Freedland was referring to the ownership of the Jewish Chronicle following its purchase by a consortium led by Sir Robbie Gibb in 2020. Sir Robbie, who is a member of the governing board of the BBC, was listed as the sole “person with significant control” on the Companies House register until August this year when he resigned and ceased to be a director. Freedland concluded by saying that he was breaking his connection with the paper because he no longer recognised it. His post was shared by Aaronovitch, who wrote: ""I have done the same.

Two audience members at his Fluffy Fluffy Beavers show, who were believed to be Israeli, objected to a joke comparing an abusive wife complaining about being abused herself to ""like being married to Israel"". They were heckled by other audience members as they left the venue, with Mr Hunter alleged to have then made a joke about the Jewish Chronicle newspaper being behind a paywall, saying it was ""typical Jews"". Police Scotland told the BBC that it was investigating the incident. Pressure group Campaign Against Antisemitism were among those who criticised the comedian. Mr Hunter, who has previously been nominated for the Perrier award and has appeared on many British TV shows, posted on social media, external about the incident at Assembly’s George Square Studios venue. He wrote: ""There was an unfortunate incident in my new show Fluffy Fluffy Beavers. As a comedian I do push boundaries  in creating humour, it's part of my job. ""This inevitably creates divided opinions but I am staunchly anti-war and anti-bully. I regret any stress caused to the audience and venue staff members. ""Mr Hunter then re-posted messages of support, including one saying ""stop saying 'antisemitism' to shut down criticism of the actions of Netanyahu/Israel. "" The incident had first been reported by the Daily Telegraph, whose critic Dominic Cavendish was reviewing the show, external. Mr Cavendish called it the ""most unpleasant comedy gig I’ve ever attended"" and said that audience members had ""erupted"" with abuse towards the Israeli couple, calling them ""genocidal maniac"" and telling them they were not welcome at the gig.  Campaign Against Antisemitisim said on social media that the comments were ""extremely concerning"" and that comedians should ""have a responsibility to their audience"". A Police Scotland spokesperson said the force was ""reviewing the circumstances"" of the incident.  In February, the comedian Paul Currie unveiled a Palestine flag during his show and became embroiled in a row with an audience member, telling the man to leave immediately. The man later said he felt threatened leaving as other audience members shouted abuse at him. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli offensive came after Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, capturing 251 others as hostages.

2919,2024-08-09 16:00:04.379000+00:00,/news/articles/cnd0e5w7l96o,"Like every morning, there was tension. It crackled in the air like static. So much was happening lately that only a fool would walk into the hills and not be on their guard. The sun was already high, pulsing heat across the stillness of the land. There was the sound of the animals’ bells, men and boys whistling to call in the dogs. High on the hill opposite was the Jewish settlement of Rotem. Close by was an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) post. There to protect the settlers. Anybody looking down would see the gathering at Ahmad Daraghme’s home: the Palestinian shepherd; the Israeli activists who support him; the foreign journalists with their camera. Chatting to Ahmad was a 71-year-old Jewish man who regularly accompanies the shepherd into the hills, in spite of violence and harassment. A man who, I sense, is not going to back down from any fight he believes to be righteous. “When I am convinced that my positions are true, I am ready to fight for my beliefs. Call it stubborn? All right,” says Gil Alexander. He belongs to the Jordan Valley Activists, a group of Israelis committed to protecting Palestinians. They accompany shepherds to and from the grazing lands. Maybe the settlers would appear around al-Farisiyah this morning, maybe not. The harassment was more frequent since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping 251. Settler violence that had been going on for years in the West Bank was escalating sharply, aimed, the Palestinians believe, at driving them off the land. According to OCHA - the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs - there have been more than 1,000 attacks by settlers against Palestinians since October, external, with at least 1,390 people - including 660 children - displaced. Lethal violence has frequently accompanied the attacks. OCHA recorded 107 that led to Palestinian fatalities and injuries, 859 causing damage to Palestinian property.  Thousands of trees and saplings belonging to Palestinians have been destroyed. Farmers like Ahmad describe how access to water for families, crops and herds is regularly blocked or limited. International attention has been focused on Gaza, but the scale of settler violence prompted the US, the EU and Britain to impose sanctions on some settler leaders and, for the first time, against entire settler outposts. The activists in the Jordan Valley understand that the important thing is to stay calm. No matter how much provocation there is. Gil Alexander knows what the settlers are capable of, even when no resistance is offered. He has the scars to prove it. But this morning he is upbeat. “A day like this,” he says, “it makes me feel good. If we can prevent attacks that gives me satisfaction. ”  Gil has become a good friend of Ahmad Daraghme, who’s been harassed repeatedly. Ahmad accuses the Israeli army and police of taking the side of the settlers, a claim supported by numerous reports by Israeli and Palestinian human rights activists. Pointing to the hills, around him, down to the main road, Ahmad says: “The problem is…all this land is forbidden for us. This hill is forbidden, all of it is forbidden. This situation is a mess: it doesn’t matter if we have permission or we don't, they are always creating problems for us. ”We climbed up into the hills, over rocks and gullies, until a valley opened out below us. The land was auburn coloured, covered with dried stalks of recently cut corn, good fodder for hungry sheep. Ahmad was ahead of us on his donkey, leading the flock towards the grazing land, as his forefathers had done for generations. A mountain deer flickered through the heat haze and vanished. The picture was of a pastoral eden. In reality it is a bitter battleground. Last December Gil Alexander and another activist were with Ahmad when settlers attacked at night. They were badly beaten and pepper sprayed. In an incident elsewhere in the valley Gil collapsed to the ground trying to prevent a settler from scattering a Palestinian flock. He has experienced constant threats. The fact that he is a devout religious Jew infuriates the settlers, who believe the West Bank - the ancient lands of Judea and Samaria - belong to the Jewish people. Gil is the son of French Jews and emigrated to Israel when he was 20. His father fought in the French Resistance against the Nazis. “I feel like a representative of a humanitarian religious Judaism,” Gil says. ""There are few today in Israel. ""The Palestinians like Ahmad Daraghme have lived under occupation since Israel conquered the territory in the Six Day War of 1967. Since then over 160 settlements have been built in the Occupied Territories - including East Jerusalem - with around 700,000 Jewish residents. There are approximately three million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. For Gil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders. Any settlements in the West Bank should only exist with Palestinian consent.  ”We can love this land without being the owners, the sole owners of the land… In order that we are not constantly holding the local population by force, we should give away part of this land, in the hope that we will be able to get there freely later on. ” Gil says only this can avoid “the national religious conflict that has existed for 100 years, since Zionism existed, between the Palestinian population and the Jewish population”. Although Gil believes “nothing is impossible” such an idea seems far-fetched in the bitter politics of the present. Israel now has the most right-wing government in its history. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the support of pro-settler parties for the survival of his governing coalition. Recently Israel’s far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, spoke of ""mega-strategic"" moves to expand settlement activity with government funding. Three weeks ago the government declared nearly 3,000 acres in the Jordan Valley as ""state land"" - the largest such amount in three decades. It comes on top of a similar declaration of nearly 2,000 acres in the area in March. The top UN court - the International Court of Justice - has described the Israeli occupation as ""de-facto annexation"" and in breach of the Convention on the Eradication of Racial Discrimination which condemns “racial segregation and apartheid"". Ahmad Daraghme knows how it works on the ground. Speaking of his old grazing pastures, he says: “All these areas, all these places, we are not allowed to reach them. Some have been planted with olive trees. Some became reserved areas…They want us to leave this area. They want to be here. They don't want us to be here. ”The political momentum is with the settlers. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, recently voted by a majority of 68 to nine to reject a Palestinian state on the West Bank on the basis that it “would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilise the region”. Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that Israeli security control over the West Bank is essential for the country’s safety. To someone like Shai Rosengarten, people like the Jordanian Valley Activists are ""radicals"" who should stay out of the West Bank. He says “the settlements in Israel are very important, because we think that in Israel, we have to connect to our heritage”. Coincidentally, like Gil he is descended from Holocaust survivors. His grandfather arrived in Israel from Poland in the years after the war. Shai is a leading figure in the Zionist organisation Im Tirtzu which supports the settlements. Settler violence, he says, is only carried out by a minority. He claims that what he calls ""radical"" human rights activists are the problem. “We see them as radical. And we see their activity as interrupting military activity. So this is very bad for the area. ” I asked Shai if what he really meant was that it was bad for the settlers?“No, I actually mean that they are interrupting military activity. Of course, they're trying to harass settlers, but they're also trying to harass soldiers. And we have many examples of those kinds of activities coming in front of Israeli soldiers, and just, you know, put their camera in front of their face. ""And you know, this is very, very harming and this is very bad for the Israeli soldiers that need to concentrate on what is happening. ""Gil adamantly rejects such a characterisation and argues that he is defending true Jewish values. He is part of an Israeli minority who have little political influence at the moment. But standing in the shade of an Acacia tree, with Ahmad rounding up the sheep and goats to corral them for the night, Gil Alexander insisted there was hope for a peaceful end to a conflict that he believed had no military solution. “We have no choice… War, it’s obvious, will provide nothing. From war to war, we are weaker and weaker… Even our strength has limits. ”With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen.","Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank, together","Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank, together","palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnd0e5w7l96o,articles/article_2919.txt,results/article_2919.txt.json
2920,2024-10-09 16:55:49.168000+00:00,/news/articles/c98yklj023xo,"Two civilians have been killed and several others wounded after the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah fired at least 150 rockets into northern Israel. Paramedics said a man and a woman in their 40s were fatally wounded by shrapnel in the border town of Kiryat Shmona. They were a couple who had been out walking their dog along a wooded street. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli forces in Kiryat Shmona, which most residents have evacuated after a year of cross-border fighting. These were the first Israeli civilians killed by Hezbollah since the conflict escalated two weeks ago, when Israel launched an intense air campaign targeting the Iran-backed group before invading southern Lebanon. Netanyahu's appeal to Lebanese people falls on deaf ears in BeirutBBC Verify examines footage revealing scale of damage in LebanonAnalysis: Why has America failed to broker a ceasefire? The rocket or fragments that hit Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday also sparked several fires. We could smell the fires burning before we saw them. In one street, neighbours watched as three teams of firefighters tackled plumes of smoke from a house where a rocket had landed. Katy Krelshtein watched in disbelief from the other side of the road - the house next door belonged to her father. “I saw red,” she replied, when I asked for her reaction. “It’s gone beyond fear now - it’s just anger. ”Rockets have been a daily reality for a year now in Kiryat Shmona, and many people there said they wanted their military to do whatever it takes to make them stop. As we arrived and began filming, there were several more rocket alerts and interceptions. This close to the border, residents have just seconds to reach a shelter. We watched as one large barrage of more than 20 rockets, followed by what looked like a missile, were all intercepted in the sky overhead - part of what the Israeli military said were 90 projectiles launched from Lebanon in a single eight-minute window. Earlier on Wednesday, we were in another town to the west, where the border cuts straight down the hill overlooking it. Burned patches of forest mark where artillery and rockets have landed. In the deserted streets below, the sound of gunfire from across the hill echoed around empty houses. Shelley Barkan, one of very few who have stayed there, said there were sometimes eight or nine rocket alerts each day now. “I’ve got pieces of rockets in my garden,” she said. “Their aim is to murder us, to kill us, to send Israel to the sea, and our aim is to defend ourselves. ”She showed us the catering hall where she helps prepare food for the local soldiers. While we were there, we heard a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon over our heads towards Israeli towns further south. Minutes later, rockets landed in the coastal city of Haifa, wounding another five people, including a teenage boy. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. The military says the aim of its ground invasion, which began nine days ago, is to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure along the border that it says poses an imminent threat to Israeli communities. There were reports of intense battles between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters in several southern Lebanese areas on Wednesday. Hezbollah said its fighters had pushed back Israeli troops advancing towards the western village of Labbouneh, attacked others inside the eastern village of Maroun al-Ras, and shelled troops near Mays al-Jabal, which is near Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military, meanwhile, said its troops and aircraft had destroyed more than 100 Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon over the past day. The Lebanese health ministry said at least four people had been killed and 10 injured in an Israeli air strike on the village of Wardaniyeh, to the north-east of the coastal city of Sidon. The state-run National News Agency reported that the strike hit a hotel housing displaced families.",Couple killed by Hezbollah rocket fire in northern Israel,Couple killed by Hezbollah rocket fire in northern Israel,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98yklj023xo,articles/article_2920.txt,results/article_2920.txt.json
2921,2024-10-30 22:18:12.294000+00:00,/news/articles/c6247nwz73do,"An Israeli military official has told the BBC that it carried out a deadly strike on a five-storey residential building in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza on Tuesday in response to seeing a “spotter” on the roof with binoculars observing Israeli forces. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said more than 90 Palestinians, including 25 children, were killed or missing beneath the rubble of the building, which collapsed as a result of the strike. The military official said it was not a planned strike and troops did not know the building was being used as a shelter for displaced people. They also said there were discrepancies between the number of casualties reported and what the military had observed. The strike provoked a strong response from Israel's closest ally, the US, which described it as a “horrifying incident with a horrifying result” and demanded an explanation. On Wednesday, after the military official had spoken to reporters, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel was “not doing enough to get us the answers that we have requested”. ""They have said to us what they had said publicly, which is they're investigating the matter,"" he added. Israel does not allow the BBC and other international media into Gaza to report independently, making it difficult to verify facts on the ground, so we rely on information from video footage and witness testimonies. Videos posted on social media a few hours after the strike showed multiple bodies wrapped in blankets and people collecting body parts at the scene of the strike. Umm Malik Abu Nasr later told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme on Tuesday that the strike destroyed her family’s home and that she was among the survivors pulled from the rubble. “At around 00:30 or 01:00, the Awda family house next to us was bombed,” she said. “We rushed to help and host them but their daughter [died] in our home. ”“At 04:00 the multi-storey house of the Abu Nasr family collapsed on top of us. They [Israel forces] bombed the house, which was housing about 300 displaced people who had fled their homes. These people sought to take refuge in our houses. We hosted them because they were just civilians and had nothing to do with resistance [Palestinian armed groups]. ”“My husband and other young men are still under the rubble and have not been pulled out yet,” she added. “My husband’s cousin and her five children are still under the rubble. ”The director of the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital - which only has two doctors and limited nursing staff following an Israeli raid last week - said in a voice message recorded on Tuesday, external that it had received the bodies of more than 25 people killed in the strike and that another 77 were trapped under the rubble. About 45 injured, including children and women, had also been brought to the hospital either by horse-drawn carts or by people carrying them, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya added. The UN’s Middle East peace envoy, Tor Wennesland, said it was the latest in “a deadly series of recent mass casualty incidents, alongside a massive displacement campaign, in the north of Gaza that raises serious concerns about violations of humanitarian law”. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the Israeli military launched a ground offensive in Beit Lahia as well as neighbouring Jabalia and Beit Hanoun on 6 October, saying it was acting against regrouping Hamas fighters. More than 70,000 residents have fled to Gaza City, but the UN estimates that about 100,000 remain in dire conditions, with severe shortages of food, water and medical supplies. The offensive has also forced the closure of essential services, including medical facilities, firefighting, search and rescue, water wells and bakeries. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,160 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Deadly Israeli strike targeted 'spotter' on Beit Lahia building's roof, official says","Deadly Israeli strike targeted 'spotter' on Beit Lahia building's roof, official says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6247nwz73do,articles/article_2921.txt,results/article_2921.txt.json
2922,2024-09-18 14:36:06.330000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2kn10xxldo,"Lebanon’s health minister says the number of people killed when pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah exploded on Tuesday has risen to 12, including two children and four healthcare workers. Firas Abiad told a news conference that almost two-thirds of the 2,800 wounded people needed some form of surgery to their face, eyes or hands, and that many had suffered amputations. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, blamed Israel for the attack and warned that it would face a “severe reckoning”. While Israel declined to comment, media reports cited US and Lebanese sources as saying Israeli operatives had hidden small amounts of explosives inside recently imported pagers. The UN, US and UK have appealed for calm and restraint, amid fears of an all-out war. Israel’s leaders have said they are ready to step up military action to return tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country to their homes after 11 months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends. Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsettingHospitals across Lebanon were overwhelmed by casualties on Tuesday afternoon, after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah blew up almost simultaneously in shops, homes, and cars, and on streets. Tracy Chamoun, a Lebanese writer, politician and former ambassador to Jordan, told the BBC the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosions was “horrifying”. She had been travelling in a car along a flyover in Beirut’s southern suburbs - a stronghold of Hezbollah - when she suddenly saw people lying on a road below. “All hell broke loose as they started to scramble to take these people to hospital. The cars were just pushed aside as motorbikes and cars came through with people covered in blood,” she said. “One of the injured men who I saw had his eye blown out. Another one had half of his face ripped off. ”Hezbollah has provided no details about what happened, but it is known that the group has long relied on pagers for communications due to concerns among its leaders about mobile phones being hacked or tracked by Israeli security forces. Ms Chamoun said the pagers had “emitted a sound before being detonated to encourage people to take them out of their pockets or from their desks and lift them to their heads”. US and Lebanese sources told the New York Times, external and Reuters news agency, external that Israel planted small amounts of explosives inside at least 3,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah this year from a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Gold Apollo. ""The Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code. It's very hard to detect it through any means,"" one Lebanese security source told Reuters. Gold Apollo’s founder denied it had anything to do with the blasts and said it had signed an agreement with another company based in Budapest, BAC Consulting, to manufacturer the devices and use its name. The BBC has attempted to reach BAC. Axios meanwhile cited, external US officials as saying that Israel had decided to blow up the pagers “out of concern its secret operation might have been discovered”. ""It was a use it or lose it moment,"" one official was quoted as describing the timing. Lebanon’s health minister said an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy were among the dead, as well as several healthcare workers from Dahiyeh, in southern Beirut, who had been using pagers. Of the 2,800 people who were wounded, about 750 were in the south of Lebanon, 150 in the Bekaa Valley, and about 1,850 in the capital and its suburbs, he added. Mr Abiad said a large number of patients were in intensive care, some due to injuries affecting their ability to breathe. Others had injuries related to bleeding, including brain haemorrhages. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured by one of the blasts, but his family and Iranian officials said he was in a ""good and stable condition"". In an interview with the BBC, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital in Beirut said the past 24 hours there had been “a nightmare”. “Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes,"" Dr Elias Warrak said, adding that more than 60 to 70% of the patients ended up with at least one eye removed. “Some of the patients, we had to remove both eyes. It kills me. In my past 25 years in practice, I’ve never removed as many eyes as I did yesterday. ”Hezbollah has announced the deaths of 12 fighters since Tuesday afternoon, including the son of the Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar. However, it has not given details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem"" - a phrase it has been using to refer to fighters killed by Israel. The only death the group directly attributed to a pager explosion was an employee of the al-Rassoul Al-Aazam Hospital in southern Beirut. Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue operations ""in support of Gaza"" and ""defend Lebanon"". “This path is ongoing and separate from the severe reckoning that the criminal enemy must face for the massacre it committed on Tuesday against our people, our families, and our fighters in Lebanon,” it added. The UN Special Co-ordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned of “an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context”. She urged all parties to “refrain from any further action, or bellicose rhetoric, which could trigger a wider conflagration that nobody can afford”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that his country - Israel’s closest ally - had known about or been involved in the explosions. Negotiating a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas would be the best way to reduce regional tensions, he said at a news conference with his Egyptian counterpart in Cairo. “We remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza to see it spread to other fronts,” he added. Israel has yet to respond to any claims. However, the Israeli military quoted the head of its Northern Command, MG Ori Gordin, as saying forces were ""determined to change the security reality as soon as possible"" along the border with Lebanon.",Death toll from Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon rises to 12,Death toll from Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon rises to 12,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2kn10xxldo,articles/article_2922.txt,results/article_2922.txt.json

Uncommitted delegates - who oppose US support of Israel's war in Gaza - began a sit-in protest just outside of the arena doors on Wednesday night. But by 18:00 local time on Thursday - the deadline protesters had set to hear from Kamala Harris's campaign - activists said they had not received a response to their requests for a Palestinian to be allowed to take the stage. The sit-in protest on the final night of the convention came as thousands of demonstrators outside the perimeter continued to rally against the war in Gaza and White House policy. The demonstrations this week have been largely peaceful, except for a smaller, unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli consulate that led to 56 arrests. ""This has been a disastrous decision by the Democratic leadership to deny a bare-minimum ask that we requested weeks ago, prior to the convention,"" said Layla Elabed, a co-leader of the uncommitted national movement. The Harris campaign told the BBC that campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez had met leaders from the uncommitted movement in recent days. ""There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the war in Gaza and the need to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. You will continue to hear that message,"" a spokesperson said. Uncommitted delegates were selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year. President Joe Biden won an overwhelming share of primary voters, but pro-Palestinian activists urged people to vote ""uncommitted"" and similar options in a number of states. Enough Democratic voters did so to send 30 delegates to the convention in Chicago, out of a total of more than 2,400 delegates. Israel's war in Gaza has divided the Democratic Party, but has largely been avoided as a topic of discussion during the DNC this week. The uncommitted protesters said they had given the Harris campaign a list of several potential Palestinians who could speak at the conference. The activists said the Harris campaign sent aides and lawmakers to the sit-in protest outside the arena on Wednesday night to try to resolve the conflict, but they refused to offer a speaking slot. Uncommitted activists said they were told that the focus of the convention was on the vice-president, as she prepared to give a speech that would be the ""biggest of her life"". The delegates said they had been asking to have a Palestinian speaker address the crowd at the convention for two months. ""We're going to have to have a lot of difficult conversations with the vice-president and her team after this,"" said Abbas Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan. ""We're going to have to take stock of what happened. "" Despite the large protests outside the arena doors, the war in Gaza has been mentioned by only a handful of speakers throughout the four-day programme. Mr Alawieh said the goal of having a Palestinian speaker at the convention was about ""forcing"" the Democratic Party to ""create space for talking about Palestinian human rights"". Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, an outspoken critic of US support of Israel, told the BBC she was not surprised the topic has not been featured much during the convention. “Interestingly, foreign policy never really is a huge topic that’s talked about,” she said. “But I’ve always thought of foreign policy as domestic policy.

2925,2024-10-11 23:13:52.527000+00:00,/news/articles/czxlrlkk8k8o,"Three months after a 13-year-old girl left Gaza for medical treatment, she is in intensive care in a UAE hospital after complications from surgery. Lamis Abusalim has severe scoliosis that, if left untreated, could compress her lungs and eventually kill her. Before her surgery she spent most of the time on her back, because when she sat up, she struggled for air. But during an operation to correct her condition on 4 October, her heart stopped three times, her mother said. Doctors told the family the girl had suffered some brain damage. It is a devastating setback for Lamis and her family, who had spent months trying to escape the war in Gaza to get medical help. Their story was mentioned in BBC coverage of a wider evacuation in July. Lamis had been due to undergo treatment in Jerusalem last October following three unsuccessful operations in Gaza. But since the start of Israel’s military offensive following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, most of Gaza's residents have been unable to leave the territory. Eventually, Lamis and her mother were able to get on a list to evacuate with the help of international organisations. After the complicated surgery, the family is now seeking help to transfer Lamis to the UK or another country for further treatment, although it would be difficult to move her. ""All kids have the right to live in a safe place, in a good place, and seek treatment,"" said her mother, Shatha. ""The kids are not the ones who make the conflict. "" The months-long, multi-national effort to evacuate Lamis reveals how hard it is for Palestinians in Gaza to access medical care. Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 251 back to Gaza as hostages. The Israeli military offensive that followed has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The bombardments have closed hospitals, killed doctors, and overwhelmed remaining facilities with casualties. The Israeli military says it has attacked some hospitals because, it says, Hamas combatants have been using them as bases. Hamas denies this. Before the war, Lamis, a “beautiful child” and youngest of five, loved drawing and attending her special education school, her mother said. At six months old she was diagnosed with a genetic white matter disease. Dr Joshua Bonkowsky, a professor of paediatric neurology at University of Utah Health said it was a category of brain disease that leaves a third of children dead by the age of eight. He was not familiar with Lamis’ case. Barely any of the diseases are curable, but treatment is available for resulting conditions. In January, the health ministry in Gaza referred Lamis for treatment abroad for her scoliosis. The ministry recorded that she had respiratory compromise and difficulty swallowing food, and recommended surgery. Her family reached out to charity HEAL Palestine, which arranged treatment with a US hospital, while an Israeli NGO, Gisha, sought security clearance for evacuation. In June, Lamis received clearance a day before an evacuation via the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, but did not get on the list in time to leave, according to Gisha. Then, in late July, her mother received a call from the World Health Organization (WHO) that she and her daughter would be evacuating. After a last-minute delay - which led Shatha to take her daughter on a two-hour journey back home to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza - they received another call the next day saying the evacuation was back on. Shatha said goodbye to her husband without knowing when they would see each other again. “It was really difficult for me,” Shatha said. “I did not want to look back. ” Shatha boarded the bus to depart Gaza carrying only a handbag and Lamis on her back, as they had to leave the girl's wheelchair and bags packed with clothes. Lamis cried in pain on the bus ride to the border with Israel, where they took another bus before boarding a flight to the UAE. On a call in August, Shatha told the BBC she had ""finally achieved this dream"". Lamis is one of 229 patients to have left Gaza since May, according to WHO. Almost 4,900 patients - 35% of those who submitted requests - evacuated through the Rafah crossing into Egypt from November until May, when Israel launched a ground offensive and seized control of the Gazan side of the crossing. An estimated 12,000 patients still need evacuation. WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said people are “suffering needlessly“ and urged the “establishment of evacuation corridors via all possible routes”. Cogat, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, told the BBC Israel was “actively working on multiple fronts to establish a mechanism for evacuating patients with complex medical conditions, who require further treatment outside the Gaza Strip"". The agency said Israel was in “constant communication” with aid organisations, health authorities and countries, and reviewed evacuation requests, providing an “appropriate response, subject to security arrangements“. Since arriving in the UAE, the government has paid for Lamis' accommodation, pocket money and stay in hospital, where on Friday she remained in a critical condition. Her mother said that ""the most important thing is to get Lamis good treatment.

2926,2024-08-26 08:03:17.300000+00:00,/news/articles/c2kjzk75eplo,"The waters on parts of Gaza’s Mediterranean coastline have started turning brown as health experts warn of the spread of open sewage and diseases across the territory. Satellite images, analysed by BBC Arabic, show what appears to be a large discharge of sewage spill off the coast of Deir al-Balah. A local official told BBC Arabic displaced people in nearby camps are sending their sewage straight to sea. “It is because of the increase in the number of displaced people and many are connecting their own pipes to the rainwater drainage system,” said Abu Yazan Ismael Sarsour, head of the Deir al-Balah emergency committee. Wim Zwijnenburg, an environmental expert from the Pax for Peace organisation, confirmed that wastewater appeared to be heading into the sea from nearby crowded camps, after examining the satellite pictures. The sewage discharge in the images, captured on 2 August, covered an area of over 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles). Satellite images show the discharge first started appearing in June and that it grew steadily over the next two months. It is not clear if the coastal pollution is still growing as more recent satellite image are not available. Intensive Israeli bombardment has led to the collapse of Gaza’s waste water management infrastructure, a UN environmental report concluded in June. The Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, told BBC Arabic a dedicated humanitarian taskforce had taken action to improve the sewage system in Gaza. In recent months, Cogat co-ordinated the restoration of water wells and desalination facilities, as well as the extension of water pipes in Gaza, according to its statement. The BBC is not able to independently verify specific improvements to Gaza’s sewage infrastructure. Israel, alongside Egypt, does not allow independent journalists into Gaza except on controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Health experts, though, are sounding the alarm about the spread of waterborne diseases, after a 10-month-old baby was partially paralysed after contracting polio - the first registered case in Gaza for 25 years. UN and World Health Organization (WHO) officials also called for two one-week ceasefires so they can vaccinate 600,000 children in Gaza. But observers say the delivery of vaccines would probably hit the same barriers affecting the flow of other humanitarian aid, making distribution slow and extremely difficult.  The destruction of Gaza's health care system will also make any vaccination programme an enormous challenge. In a response to BBC Arabic, Cogat insisted there were no restrictions on medical aid. In a later social media statement, Cogat said “an additional 60,000 polio vaccines will be delivered to vaccinate over one million children” in the coming weeks. The charity Oxfam told BBC Arabic a quarter of Gaza's population had already become ill because of waterborne diseases. “We are seeing a catastrophic health crisis unfolding in front of our eyes,"" said Lama Abdul Samad, a water and sanitation expert at Oxfam. “Polio is a waterborne disease and it is directly linked to the sanitation situation. ”“The sanitation infrastructure has been damaged severely to the point that it is flooding the streets and the neighbourhoods, and people are basically living adjacent to puddles of sewage,"" she added. New photos and satellite images analysed by BBC Arabic illustrate how the problem of untreated sewage in Gaza has been getting steadily worse. The Sheikh Radwan Lagoon in northern Gaza, which was once a source of clean rainwater, appears to be overflowing with dirty water. The lagoon has clearly been contaminated by raw sewage, Ms Abdul Samad said after assessing the pictures. Several Palestinians living nearby have complained to BBC Arabic’s Gaza Lifeline emergency radio service of the overflowing waste water, stench and rodents coming out of the lagoon. “Raw sewage is running into our property because of the overflowing Sheikh Radwan Lagoon,” Ibrahim Ramzi said. Meanwhile, Ghada al-Haddad, an aid worker in central Gaza, sent BBC Arabic a video from a makeshift camp where sewage had built up into a pond next to displaced people. She described the smell as ""overpowering"" and ""unendurable”. Polio is just one part the heath crisis facing Gaza. Earlier this month, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, reported 40,000 cases of Hepatitis A – which can also be transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water - in Gaza since the start of the war compared to only 85 in the same period beforehand. Public health experts are also warning of a potential cholera epidemic. Aid agencies say doctors in Gaza are also struggling to treat a huge caseload of dysentery, pneumonia, and severe skin diseases because of the collapse of the health sector. “The reason behind the spread of these bacterial diseases is the complete lack of a sanitation system,” paediatric consultant Dr Ahmed al-Farra explained. He said the problems included the “mixing of clean ground water and sewage, the severe overpopulation, the extreme heat, the lack of ventilation, the overpopulated tents, [and] the oversharing of toilets”. The UN estimates the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been internally displaced since last autumn. Many people are living in shelters with just one toilet for 600 people, a World Health Organization official told reporters in July. On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented assault on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 40,200 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Diseases spread in Gaza as sewage contaminates camps and coast,Diseases spread in Gaza as sewage contaminates camps and coast,"palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2kjzk75eplo,articles/article_2926.txt,results/article_2926.txt.json

Families who had been forced to flee because of the war did not wait to see if the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah would hold. Just hours after it came into effect they were driving back home on the main road from Beirut. Some waved the yellow and green flag of Hezbollah, others carried posters with images of the group’s former leader Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli air strike two months ago. For many this was a moment of celebration. “What happened is very good. This is a victory for the resistance,” said Abu Ali, referring to the ceasefire that had been brokered by the US and France. “May God have mercy on our martyrs. The resistance is a source of honour and pride for us. Without its existence, there would be no homeland, no south, nothing. ”His plan was to return to the village Houla, right next to the border. But Israeli troops were still there, he said. “We don’t know whether our house is still standing or has been destroyed,” Ali said. “But we’ll go there. ” The 60-day ceasefire will see the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli military, and of Hezbollah fighters and weapons, from Lebanon’s south. The Lebanese army said it was already strengthening its presence there, as part of the deployment of an additional 5,000 soldiers under the deal. Both Israel and Hezbollah have said they are ready to respond to any violations. The ceasefire is the main hope to bring an end to over a year of conflict, that intensified in September with widespread Israeli air strikes, assassinations of top Hezbollah officials and a ground invasion. Israel’s stated goal was to move the group away from the border and stop the attacks on its northern communities. In Lebanon, more than one million people were displaced, mostly from Shia Muslim areas in the south, the eastern Bekka Valley and Dahieh in Beirut – which are essentially controlled by Hezbollah, the powerful militia and political party supported by Iran. They started to return despite warnings from Israeli and Lebanese authorities that it was not yet safe to do so. “It doesn’t matter if the house is still intact or not, the important thing is that we are returning, thanks to the blood of our martyr, Nasrallah,” said Fatma Balhas, who was travelling to the town of Seddiqine. Hezbollah-allied media also said this was a sign the group had been victorious in the war. Near Sidon, the first big city on the coast south of Beirut, cars drove on the opposite carriageway, as a traffic jam formed just outside a military checkpoint. Soldiers handed out leaflets telling people to not touch unexploded ordnance. “Don’t get close, don’t touch it, report it immediately”. As night fell on Wednesday the truce appeared to be holding, with UN chief Antonio Guterres describing it as the “first ray of hope for peace amid the darkness of the past months”. The war has devastated this country, and recovery will be long and difficult. And what will happen with Hezbollah is not clear. The group has been diminished, but it still enjoys significant support. For Lebanon, it means this crisis is not over.",Displaced Lebanese head for homes as fragile truce appears to hold,Displaced Lebanese head for homes as fragile truce appears to hold,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99rzd99mdxo,articles/article_2927.txt,results/article_2927.txt.json
2928,2024-11-02 02:26:52.354000+00:00,/news/articles/ckgv03x040xo,"Three serving US government attorneys have accused the Department of Justice of a ""glaring gap"" in upholding US laws in cases where Israeli military forces or civilians have allegedly killed American citizens. The lawyers, two of whom spoke anonymously to the BBC, raised concerns in a letter to US Attorney General Merrick Garland that there had been a ""potential violation of US law"". They cited cases of Americans who were allegedly killed in Israeli attacks in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon and called for the department to open investigations. The Department of Justice declined to comment when asked about the letter and other issues raised by its authors. Asked to comment on the cases cited in the letter, the Israeli embassy in Washington said: ""The State of Israel is committed to the rule of law. Every incident is thoroughly investigated by the IDF, and conclusions are drawn accordingly. ""The letter underscores a series of principles regarding US citizens killed abroad that Mr Garland, who leads the Department of Justice (DoJ), had publicly highlighted recently. America's top lawyer had emphasised the importance of applying US law when Americans are killed overseas and the need to expand US jurisdiction to prosecute alleged war crimes regardless of the nationality of those accused. The letter says: “We write to address the glaring gap in our enforcement of these principles in connection with potential violations of U. S. law by Israeli government forces, citizens, and others acting in concert with them. ”“Despite credible evidence of violations of U. S. law… the Department has taken no public steps to hold the perpetrators to account, even when the victims are U. S. citizens. “[T]he Department’s silence and apparent inaction is a stark omission,” it adds. The letter’s authors say that unlike the US Department of State, the justice department has no informal mechanism for serving officials to express dissent. It’s unclear how widely the views expressed in the letter are shared among the thousands of attorneys who work at the department. Their letter cites five US citizens killed in the occupied West Bank - Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, Tawfiq Abdel Jabbar, Mohammad Khdour, Omar Assad, and Shireen Abu Akleh. Their families have demanded accountability of Israeli forces or settlers alleged to be responsible for their deaths. It also cites the cases of American aid worker Jacob Flickinger, killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, and Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a US citizen killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon. Two of the attorneys who wrote the letter, both career federal prosecutors with the Department of Justice, spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. They signed the letter to Mr Garland “your colleagues”. One told the BBC that the apparent lack of action over the deaths of Americans suggested the justice department was acting as an “apparatus of politics” for its ally. The second described “disparate treatment” when it came to US citizens who had “connections to the Palestinians”. The attorney said: “This is a no brainer… Within the DoJ, everyone agrees that the killing of an American citizen is a non starter. You don't do that. And so the silence is deafening here. ” The attorneys’ letter notes that the US Department of Justice has brought charges charges against Hamas over the killings of American citizens. It also mentions that the department brought first-ever charges under the US war crimes statute against members of the Russian military in connection with the unlawful detainment of an American national. But it says the department has announced no investigations into the deaths of Americans allegedly caused by Israeli military forces or civilians. The attorneys demand the US ""apply the same rigor"" to all countries in these cases. Their letter is the latest in a growing series of public criticisms throughout the last year backed by hundreds of current and former US officials over policy on Israel and the war in Gaza. While the justice department would not comment on the letter, the US Department of State, when asked about such cases, has said that Israel carries out its own independent investigations and that they must be allowed to take their course. Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups routinely point out, however, that such investigations almost never lead to prosecutions or meaningful accountability. After intense public pressure, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry in the 2022 case of Shireen Abu Akleh - the Palestinian-American Al Jazeera correspondent shot dead by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. But this was never formally confirmed by the justice department, and US charges were never brought against anyone in the case.

Hundreds gathered in Dam Square on Sunday, calling for an end to the conflict in Gaza and expressing dissent towards the ban. Demonstrations were temporarily banned by the mayor after Israeli football fans were targeted in what she called ""hit-and-run"" attacks on Thursday night after a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam. The Israeli government has advised its citizens to ""categorically avoid"" Israeli sports and cultural events while abroad - specifically the football match between France and Israel in Paris on Thursday. Authorities say Thursday's attacks - which caused five people to be hospitalised - were motivated by antisemitism as the fans were sought out across the city. The violence - which was condemned by leaders in Europe, the US and in Israel -  has led to at least 62 arrests. The outcry was exacerbated by the attacks occurring on the eve of commemorations of the Nazi pogroms against German Jews that took place in November 1938. Three-quarters of Jewish people in the Netherlands were murdered during the Holocaust in World War Two. Amsterdam police said there had also been trouble the night before the match. Police chief Peter Holla said there had been incidents ""on both sides"", including Israeli supporters removing a Palestinian flag from a wall and setting it alight, and attacking a taxi. The city's Mayor Femke Halsema announced a ban on public assembly on Friday lasting at least until the end of the weekend, deeming the city a ""high-risk security area"". But protesters on Sunday argued they should be free to voice their disapproval of Israel's actions in Gaza and the actions of the Maccabi supporters. ""This protest has nothing to do with antisemitism,"" Alexander van Stokkum, one of the demonstrators, told the AFP news agency on Sunday. ""It is against Israeli hooligans who were destroying our city. ""Others told a Reuters journalist: ""We refuse to let the charge of antisemitism be weaponised to suppress Palestinian resistance. ""The news agency reported that more than 100 people were detained for attending the protest. Police in Amsterdam confirmed there had been arrests, but have yet to say how many. Following the protest ban, Dutch activist Frank van der Linde applied for an urgent permit so Sunday's demonstration could go ahead. On X, he said that he wanted to protest what he described as ""the genocide in Gaza"", adding: ""We will not let our right to demonstrate be taken away. ""Mr Van der Linde was overruled by Amsterdam's district court, which wrote on Sunday that ""the mayor has rightly determined that there is a ban on demonstrating in the city this weekend"". Dutch national newspaper De Telegraaf reports Mr Van der Linde was among those arrested. The Israeli embassy in the Netherlands earlier warned Israelis in Amsterdam to avoid Dam square, saying the event ""may flare up into significant violent incidents"". Israel's National Security Council has told its citizens to avoid public demonstrations ""of any kind"" and conceal ""anything that could identify you as Israeli/Jewish"", citing Thursday's attacks. ""Preparations to harm Israelis have been identified in several European cities, including Brussels (Belgium), major cities in the UK, Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Paris,"" it claimed.

Paramedics and Hamas-affiliated media said at least 66 were killed, including women and children, when several houses sheltering displaced people were hit near Kamal Adwan hospital in the town of Beit Lahia. One unverified video showed more than 20 bodies lined up in a street. Another 22 people were killed in a strike on a house in the northern Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas infrastructure in Beit Lahia and that it had taken steps to mitigate harm to civilians. It did not comment on the Gaza City incident. Deadly Israeli strikes were also reported elsewhere in Gaza on Thursday. Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of 24 people killed in Israeli military action there and in nearby Rafah. The Israeli military has recently intensified its ground offensive in parts of northern Gaza, saying it is stopping Hamas from regrouping there. The UN has said Beit Lahia, as well as the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, are under siege and that virtually no humanitarian aid has been delivered since early October. Photographs from the scene of the air strike in Beit Lahia on Thursday morning showed piles of rubble and twisted metal, about 55m (185ft) away from Kamal Adwan hospital. Its director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, said there were “dozens of dead or missing”. “Bodies arrive at the hospital in pieces,” he told AFP news agency. “But there are no ambulances, the health system is on its knees in northern Gaza. ""Dr Abu Safiya said the hospital was only able to provide first aid to most casualties brought there because Israeli forces were not allowing in enough medical supplies. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had “struck Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area of Beit Lahia” overnight and that members of Hamas had been operating there, including a number who took part in the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war. “Prior to the strikes, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance, warning the population in the area to evacuate the active combat zone, and additional intelligence information,” it added. “The incident is under review. ”Israel's ground offensive in northern Gaza has displaced up to 130,000 people over the past five weeks. The UN says 75,000 people remain under siege with dwindling supplies of water and food in Beit Lahia, Jabalia and Beit Hanoun. Last week, a report by Human Rights Watch said Israel had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by deliberately causing the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza. Israel said the report was ""completely false and detached from reality"". About 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza’s population - have fled their homes over the past year, and 79% of the territory is under Israeli-issued evacuation orders, according to the UN. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Nearly 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, the US blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the UN Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel. Fourteen of the 15 council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza ""must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released"". Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document ""abandoned"" the necessity for there to be ""a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages"". Wood said the proposed resolution would have sent a ""dangerous message"" to Hamas that ""there's no need to come back to the negotiating table"". In a separate development, US mediator Amos Hochstein has arrived in Israel from Lebanon. He has said that he sees a ""real opportunity"" to end the conflict in Lebanon after the Lebanese government and Hezbollah largely agreed to a US ceasefire proposal.",Dozens reportedly killed in Israeli strikes on northern Gaza,Dozens reportedly killed in Israeli strikes on northern Gaza,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg7zyr8p15o,articles/article_2930.txt,results/article_2930.txt.json

Hezbollah’s attack on an army base near Binyamina in northern Israel on Sunday, which killed four men and injured dozens more, was the most damaging drone strike on the country to date. It’s led to fresh questions about how well equipped Israel’s hugely expensive air defence system is to stop them. Visiting the damaged army base on Monday morning, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said “significant efforts” were being put into solutions that would prevent future drone attacks. Follow live updates on this storyAnalysing footage from the Gaza strikesWatch: ‘I say bye to my kids, in case we don’t wake up’ – two Gazans film a year under attack by IsraelAnalysis: Drone attack on Israel puts spotlight on Iron Dome's limitationsWhy is the US giving Israel a powerful Thaad anti-missile system? Some parts of the air defence system work well. Here in northern Israel we hear booms at regular intervals as the Iron Dome intercepts rockets that Hezbollah fires from southern Lebanon. Israel says it hits more than 90% of its targets. But the Iron Dome works because Hezbollah’s rockets are crude – and it’s possible to calculate where its rockets will go at take-off and then intercept them. Stopping drones is more complicated. And has in this war become a recurring problem. In July a drone fired by Yemen’s Houthis reached Tel Aviv. Earlier in October the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a drone launched from Iraq killed two soldiers in the Golan Heights. Just last week another drone hit a nursing home in central Israel. “Most, if not all, of the drones are manufactured by the Iranians and then supplied to the armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen,” Dr Yehoshua Kalisky, senior researcher of the Institute of National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told the BBC. Drones have a small radar signature and can fly at low altitudes which makes early detection difficult. They can even occasionally be confused for birds. “They’re also difficult to intercept with aircraft because the UAVs (drones) fly slowly,” Dr Kalisky explained. “They’re going about 200km/h (124mph) compared to 900km/h (559mph) of a jet plane. ” Israeli media reports suggest that on Sunday two Hezbollah drones, most likely Ziyad 107s, crossed from Lebanese air space above the Mediterranean. One was shot down and the other disappeared  – presumed crashed – so no warning siren was triggered. It then went on to hit the canteen of an army base. But Sarit Zehani from the Alma Research Institute - which specialises in security on the northern border - does not think it was luck that the drones got through. “It was planned,” she said. “They’ve been trying to do this for a long time. ”Ms Zehani lives 9km from the Lebanese border in western Galilee and saw Sunday’s events unfold from her balcony. She said there was rocket fire and alerts all across the border area as the drones were launched, “overwhelming” the air defence system and helping the drones to get through. The Alma Research Institute has counted 559 incidents of drones crossing the northern border for surveillance or attack missions since the war began a year ago. Excluding Sunday’s attack on Binyamina, it says there have been 11 casualties from drone attacks. In addition to the Iron Dome, systems such as David's Sling, Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 are designed to destroy ballistic missiles. And they will soon be bolstered by the arrival of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) battery from the United States which will be operated by nearly 100 US military personnel. More permanent solutions to take down drones are currently being developed. “High powered lasers are being worked on and the other technology is using microwave cannons to burn the drone electronics,” Dr Kalisky said.

Now I feel happiness and freedom,” he says, grinning afterwards. Rizeq is one of the first of thousands of wounded Palestinians who should receive new prosthetic limbs from Jordanian doctors using state-of-the-art British technology. Warning: This report contains graphic details of injuriesDisplaced to Rafah, he was wounded by Israeli tank fire as he left Friday prayers in June. With his leg amputated, the blacksmith could no longer work and was feeling desperate. “I lost my whole life: my job and my hope,” Rizeq says. “There was no one to take care of my wife and baby. I even needed help to use the toilet. ”The human cost of Israel’s destructive year-long war in Gaza is measured not just in lives lost but in lives changed forever. After analysing emergency medical data, the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 94,000 people are injured. More than 24,000 people – one in every 100 Gazans – have a life-changing injury. These include serious burns, trauma to the head and spine and limb amputations. At the same time, it has become virtually impossible to leave Gaza for medical treatment and only 16 out of 36 hospitals are functional. Rehabilitation services are heavily disrupted. The WHO says just 12% of equipment needed for injured people - such as wheelchairs and crutches - is available. The Jordanian programme uses innovative prosthetics from two British firms, Koalaa and Amparo. They have easy-to-fit sockets and a new direct moulding technique for lower limbs, which avoid months of waiting and multiple fittings. “This is a new type of prosthesis. Its main feature is fast manufacture. It means it will be ready for the patient within only one to two hours,” explains Jordanian army doctor, Lt Abdullah Al-Hemaida, who has deftly fitted Rizeq with his replacement leg. His medical team has already helped dozens of amputees. Each prosthetic limb costs about $1,400 (£1,100), with funding from the Jordanian state and a national charity. Every fitting is registered digitally allowing for remote monitoring and follow-up procedures. If it is safe enough, the plan is for two Jordanian mobile units to move around.  There is a huge need for prosthetics across all of Gaza among all age groups. At the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza, sisters Hanan and Misk al-Doubri are so small that they fit in one wheelchair. Last month, they lost their mother and their legs in an Israeli air strike on their home in Deir al-Balah. Misk, who is 18 months old, had just learned to walk. Now she struggles to stand on her one good foot. But Hanan, who is three, has much more severe injuries; she was blasted out of her family’s first-floor apartment. “We try to distract her, but she always returns to asking about her mum,” her aunt, Sheifa says. “Then she asks, ‘Where are my legs?’ I don’t know what to tell her. ”I asked the Israeli military why the al-Doubris were targeted but received no response. Locals believe the girls’ father, a policeman, who remains in intensive care, may have been targeted. Israel has attacked many people who worked for the security forces in Hamas-governed Gaza. With Israeli drones overhead, 15-year-old Diya al-Adini surveys the destruction by his home in Deir al-Balah. Around his neck he always wears his prized possession, bought with months of savings: a digital camera. However, he can no longer use it unaided: he has no arms. In August, Diya was playing a computer game in a coffee shop when Israel bombed it. “The speed of the rocket made it hard for me to react. After it hit, I lost consciousness for a few seconds,” Diya recalls. “When I came to, everything was white. It felt like I was watching a movie. I tried to get up, but I couldn't move at all; I didn't have any hands to help me. ”Diya used to love swimming and walking his dogs, he did errands on his bicycle and photographed landscapes. Now he relies on his older sister, Aya, to take photos for him. But he is determined to be positive. “I am trying to plan a good future so that after I get prosthetics, I can work hard and excel to become a famous photographer,” he says. “I need my limbs to return to my photography, and to everything I loved. ” Making his way on the uneven path to the tent camp that he now calls home, Rizeq Tafish has been given crutches to help him adjust to his new prosthetic leg. “I want to forget the period when I was without my legs and start again. I still consider myself to be whole and complete,” he tells a local journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. “I could go back to my job or get a different one now that I have my new limb. Just getting my leg back is also giving me back my smile that I want to share with everyone. ”But there are tears of joy as well as smiles when he reaches his family. Rizeq’s mother is overcome as he walks forward without any help to embrace her and his wife praises God as he stands holding their little boy. Rizeq is just one among many in Gaza learning to cope with a new serious disability but he has taken a step towards getting back his life.",Easy-fit prosthetics offer hope to thousands of Gaza amputees,Easy-fit prosthetics offer hope to thousands of Gaza amputees,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c624zz6m1kvo,articles/article_2932.txt,results/article_2932.txt.json
2933,2024-10-02 21:12:40.701000+00:00,/news/articles/czxgkrv9j7no,"Israel’s military says eight of its soldiers have been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, its first losses since the start of the ground invasion against the armed group Hezbollah. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it had destroyed Israeli tanks during the fighting and insisted it had enough men and ammunition to push back the forces. Earlier, the Israeli military announced that more infantry and armoured troops had joined the operation seeking to dismantle what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanese border villages. Meanwhile, at least five people died and eight were wounded in an Israeli military air strike in the Bachoura area in central Beirut, Lebanese officials said.  The multi-storey building targeted housed a Hezbollah-affiliated health centre and is just metres away from Lebanon's parliament and United Nations Regional Headquarters. This is the first Israeli strike so close to the centre of Beirut, with other attacks overnight hitting the southern suburb of Dahieh. Earlier on Wednesday evening, Lebanon's health ministry said 46 people had been killed and 85 wounded in Israeli strikes on the country in the last 24 hours, without differentiating between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah has been weakened after two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks that have killed more than 1,200 people across Lebanon and displaced around 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. On the second full day of their ground invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that soldiers backed by aircraft had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Most were commandos from the elite Egoz and Golani Reconnaissance units. Six were reportedly ambushed by Hezbollah fighters and another two were killed by mortar fire. Hezbollah said dozens of its fighters had fired ani-tank missiles at Israeli commandos, killing and wounding dozens of them, during clashes early on Wednesday in one border village. It also claimed that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, and that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras. Hezbollah has spent years building infrastructure in southern Lebanon that includes extensive underground tunnels. It also has thousands of fighters, who know the area well. Paying tribute to the eight soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had fallen ”in the midst of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us”. “This will not happen, because we will stand together, and with God’s help, we will win together,” he added. Israeli air defences were also in action again a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the Israeli air strike in Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout Wednesday, according to the IDF. Netanyahu insists that the ground offensive in Lebanon will degrade Hezbollah’s capability and push its fighters back, eventually allowing about 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes near the border. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden said he did not support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites. He added that the US ""will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do"" in response to the Iranian barrage. The overnight air strikes in Beirut follows heavy strikes in Dahieh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the previous night after the IDF issued several evacuation orders for areas around buildings it said were linked to the group. On Wednesday morning, a BBC team was taken there on a media tour organised by Hezbollah to show the recent destruction. Once a bustling district, Dahieh now looks like a ghost town. Shops have been closed, streets are deserted and most of its residents have left. One of the sites on the tour was the headquarters of Sirat TV, which was hit on Monday. It was flattened, and nearby buildings were severely damaged, an indication of the power of the attack. There was still smoke billowing from the rubble and a heavy smell in the air, while the sound of Israeli drones flying overhead could be heard. There were several posters with the face of Hassan Nasrallah. One said: “None of our banners shall fall. ”Hezbollah says Israel has been hitting civilian buildings, not those used for military purposes. Israel accused the group of hiding weapons and ammunition in residential areas. US and Israeli officials believe half of Hezbollah’s arsenal has been destroyed and its leadership has been dismantled. But Mohammed Afif, a Hezbollah spokesman, remained defiant. “I can say the resistance is swiftly recovering its strength,” he told the BBC. “The leadership of the resistance is well, its command-and-control structure is well, and its supply of rockets is well. ”“God willing, we will inflict defeat upon the Israeli enemy when they dare cross into Lebanon. ” As well as Dahieh, many people have fled two other regions where Hezbollah has a strong presence - the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Beirut’s Martyr’s Square has become a place where dozens of families have gathered, with nowhere to go. Some tents have been set up near concrete walls, but many are sleeping on the steps of the nearby Mohammad al-Amin Mosque or on mattresses on the ground. Mohammed, who is 55, arrived five days ago with his wife, his son and seven grandchildren. They were trying to move to a shelter, he said, but had not been able to find a place. “We’ve got nowhere to go,” he said. Thanks to donations, they have been able to eat. But they are struggling without diapers, milk, and medicine. Next to him, 26-year-old Mohammed had arrived with his three children. He said he worked in Dahieh but that he lost his job because all its shops were closed. “There’s no work,” he said.",Eight Israeli troops killed in fighting with Hezbollah inside Lebanon,Eight Israeli troops killed in fighting with Hezbollah inside Lebanon,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxgkrv9j7no,articles/article_2933.txt,results/article_2933.txt.json

He and a colleague are gazing at the sky, trying to spot the Israeli surveillance drone buzzing overhead. Neither the music playing in the background nor birdsong can mask its deep, humming noise. It’s like someone has left a hairdryer on, or a motorbike is doing laps of the clouds. Marwan’s hotel is not in an area with a strong Hezbollah presence.

It’s also where I am based. Days later, two Israeli missiles roar over Achrafieh. I hear children and adults in the neighbourhood scream. People run to their balconies or open their windows trying to figure out what’s just happened. Within seconds a strong explosion shakes the tree-lined streets. Everyone in my building looks towards Dahieh, the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburb of Beirut which is partly visible from Achrafieh. But soon we realise the strike has hit an area just a five-minute drive away from us. Local media say the target is Wafiq Safa, a high-ranking Hezbollah security official who’s also the brother-in-law of recently killed leader Hassan Nasrallah. He reportedly survives. The building that was hit was full of people who’d recently fled to Beirut. No warning was issued by the Israeli army, and at least 22 people were killed. It was the deadliest attack yet. “Oh my God. What if we were passing through that street?” a neighbour exclaims. “I pass that street to go to work. ”“What is the guarantee that next time they won’t hit a building on our street, if they have a target?” another asks. The recent turmoil in Lebanon started on 17 and 18 September, when waves of pager blasts killed at least 32 and left more than 5,000 injured, both Hezbollah fighters and civilians. Many lost their eyes or hands, or both. Air strikes intensified in the south, as well as on Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing high-rank Hezbollah commanders including Nasrallah. On 30 September, Israel invaded southern Lebanon. Officials say more than 1,600 people have been killed in Israel’s bombardment over the past weeks. I’ve seen many of the strikes from my own balcony. The past three weeks have felt like a “fast-forward”, Marwan the waiter tells me. “We haven’t digested what exactly happened. ”I’ve spoken to him many times in the past 12 months since tensions erupted between Hezbollah and Israel. He’s lived here his entire life and seen all the wars between the two sides. But he’s always been an optimist, and never believed that this round of fighting would escalate into a war. “I withdraw what I was telling you,” he tells me now. “I didn’t want to believe it but we are at war. ” The face of Beirut has completely changed. Streets are packed with cars, some parked in the middle of boulevards. Hundreds fleeing Israeli operations in the south of the country have fled to the capital’s suburbs, sheltering in schools in “safer” neighbourhoods. Many have found themselves sleeping on the streets. On the motorway towards the airport and the south, billboards show Hassan Nasrallah’s face. Both pro- and anti-Hezbollah people tell me these feel surreal. In other areas, posters that previously read “Lebanon doesn’t want war” now say “Pray for Lebanon”. The city’s iconic Martyrs’ Square - usually host to protests and huge Christmas celebrations - has turned into a tent city. Families squeeze under the skeleton of an iron Christmas tree. Around a cut-out clenched fist installed above the square after youth protests in 2019, there are blankets, mattresses and tents made of whatever else people could find. More of the same awaits around every corner. Makeshift homes stretch from the square all the way down to the sea. Most of the families here are Syrian refugees, who’ve found themselves displaced again and barred from shelters which are limited to Lebanese nationals. But many Lebanese families have found themselves homeless too. Just over a kilometre away, 26-year-old Nadine is trying to take her mind off everything for a few hours. She’s one of very few customers at Aaliya’s Books, a bookshop-bar in Beirut’s Gemmayze neighbourhood. “I don’t feel safe any more,” she tells me. “We keep hearing explosions all night. “I keep asking myself: what if they bomb here? What if they target a car in front of us?”For a long time, Beirutis believed that tensions would stay limited to Hezbollah-run border villages in southern Lebanon. Nasrallah, who led the powerful Shia political and military organisation, said he didn’t want to take the country to war, and that the front against Israel was solely to support Palestinians in Gaza. That all changed. In Beirut, although strikes mostly land in the southern suburbs, where Hezbollah dominates, they send shockwaves across the city - resulting in sleepless nights. Businesses are affected. Aaliya's Books is usually a lively place, hosting local bands, podcasts and wine-tasting nights. We were filming here for a report right after the first air strike on Dahieh, on 30 July, which killed Hezbollah’s second-in-command Fuad Shukr. Intense sonic booms could be heard overhead as Israeli jets broke the sound barrier. But a jazz band played all night, with dancing patrons crowding the bar. Now the place is empty, with no music and no dancing. “It is sad and frustrating,” says bar manager Charlie Haber. “You come here to change your mood but again you will end up talking about the situation. Everyone is asking, what is next?”His place closed for two weeks after Nasrallah’s killing. Now they’ve reopened, but shut at 20:00 instead of midnight. Day by day, the psychological strain on staff and customers worsens, says Charlie. Even a post on Instagram takes half a day to write, he adds, because you “don’t want to look like ‘hey, come and enjoy and we’ll give you a discount on drinks’ in this situation”. It’s hard to find anywhere open late any more in this area. Loris, a well-loved restaurant, never used to shut before 01:00 - but now the streets are deserted by 19:00, says one of its owners, Joe Aoun. Three weeks ago you couldn’t get a table here without a reservation. Now, barely two or three tables are taken each day. “We take it day by day. We are sitting here and talking together now, but maybe in five minutes we’ll have to close down and leave. ”Most of Loris’s staff come from Beirut’s southern suburbs or villages in the country’s south. “Each day one of them hears that his house is destroyed,” says Joe. One employee, Ali, didn’t come to work for 15 days as he was trying to find somewhere for his family to stay. They’d slept under olive trees in the south for weeks. Joe says Loris is trying to stay open to help staff make a living but he’s not sure how long this can continue. Fuel for the generators is extremely expensive. I see the frustration on his face. “We are against war,” he says. “My staff from the south are Shia but they are against war too. But no one asked for our opinion. We can’t do anything else. We just need to to hold on. ” Back at Aaliya’s, both Charlie and Nadine are worried about community tensions rising. These parts of Beirut are mostly Sunni Muslim and Christian - but the new arrivals are largely Shia. “I personally try to help people regardless of their religion or sect but even in my family there are divisions over it. Part of my family only help and accommodate displaced Christians,” she says. Out in the squares and alleys of Achrafieh and Gemmayze, more and more flags can be seen of Lebanese Forces, a Christian party that strongly opposes Hezbollah. The party has a long history of armed conflict with Shia Muslims, as well as Muslim and Palestinian parties during the civil war, three decades ago. Nadine thinks this is a message to displaced Shias who have recently arrived, saying “don’t come here”. With the movement of people, there are also fears that Israel can now target any building in any neighbourhood in its search for Hezbollah fighters or members of allied groups. Hezbollah says its high-ranking officials do not stay in places assigned to displaced people. None of this bodes well for local businesses. Many in Gemmayze were already badly affected by the Beirut port explosion four years ago, which killed 200 people and destroyed more than 70,000 buildings. They’d only recently started getting back on their feet. Despite the financial crisis, new places were springing up in the area - but many of them have closed now. Maya Bekhazi Noun, an entrepreneur and board member of the restaurant and bar owners’ syndicate, estimates that 85% of food and drink spots in downtown Beirut have shut down or limited their opening hours. “Everything happened so fast and we couldn’t do any statistics yet but I can tell you more around 85 percent of food and beverage places in downtown Beirut are closed or working for limited hours only. ”“It is difficult to keep the places open for joy when there are many people are sleeping without enough food and supplies nearby. ”Despite the tough situation in Beirut, you can still find bustling restaurants and bars around a 15 minute-drive north. But Maya says that too is temporary. “Strikes may happen in other locations too. There have been attacks on some places in the north. There is no guarantee they will be safe either. ”It’s like someone pressed a button and life stopped in Beirut, she says. “We are on hold. We were aware of the war in the south - and somehow affected by it too - but many like me didn’t expect the war to come this close. ”",Empty bars and bookshops: How Israeli strikes transformed Lebanon's buzzing capital,Empty bars and bookshops: How Israeli strikes transformed Lebanon's buzzing capital,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq8xpqjqx7eo,articles/article_2934.txt,results/article_2934.txt.json

Thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Edinburgh, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and to highlight the human cost of Israel's response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas. Smaller demonstrations also took place in Aberdeen and Inverness. A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attacks on Israel will be held in Glasgow on Sunday. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed at least 41,825 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Violence has spread to Lebanon in recent weeks. Thousands of pro-Palestinian supporters marched from the foot of The Mound through Edinburgh city centre waving the flags of both Palestine and Lebanon. Organisers, Stop the War Coalition, are calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East and an end to Britain supplying arms to Israel. One of those attending the demonstration was Majdi Awwad from Tulkarm in the West Bank who is now living in Edinburgh. He said a year into the conflict, he feels ""more hope"" in part due to the public's awareness of events. He said: ""All of the people who are attending the rally get to understand what is happening. ""Not everybody has to be a part of the story, but as long as they have in their conscience and the knowledge about what is happening it will be much better. "" Omar Afzal, who travelled from Glasgow to attend the event, said he was worried that the war was spreading more widely across the Middle East. ""It’s still deeply concerning and truth be told we don’t see much light at the end of the tunnel at this point in time,"" he said. The First Minister John Swinney has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to UK arms being exported to Israel. Sir Keir Starmer said a ""ceasefire that lasts"" must ""happen now"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict while speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in February. Earlier this week, the defence secretary, John Healey, said UK forces were involved in supporting Israel after Iran launched ballistic missiles at the country. The last week has seen a significant escalation of the crisis in the Middle East, with warnings that it could develop into an all-out regional war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. The prime minister has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"", following a further escalation in the region.",Events held marking one year since start of latest Middle East conflict ,Events held marking one year since start of latest Middle East conflict ,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70w95kzljjo,articles/article_2935.txt,results/article_2935.txt.json
2937,2024-09-02 23:02:47.784000+00:00,/news/articles/c207j6wy332o,"Last October, Palestinian grandmother Ayesha Shtayyeh says a man pointed a gun at her head and told her to leave the place she had called home for 50 years. She told the BBC the armed threat was the culmination of an increasingly violent campaign of harassment and intimidation that began in 2021, after an illegal settler outpost was established close to her home in the occupied West Bank. The number of these outposts has risen rapidly in recent years, new BBC analysis shows. There are currently at least 196 across the West Bank, and 29 were set up last year - more than in any previous year. The outposts - which can be farms, clusters of houses, or even groups of caravans - often lack defined boundaries and are illegal under both Israeli and international law. But the BBC World Service has seen documents showing that organisations with close ties to the Israeli government have provided money and land used to establish new illegal outposts. The BBC has also analysed open source intelligence to examine their proliferation, and has investigated the settler who Ayesha Shtayyeh says threatened her. Experts say outposts are able to seize large swathes of land more rapidly than settlements, and are increasingly linked to violence and harassment towards Palestinian communities. BBC InDepth: Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently Official figures for the number of outposts do not exist. But BBC Eye reviewed lists of them and their locations gathered by Israeli anti-settlement watchdogs Peace Now and Kerem Navot - as well as the Palestinian Authority, which runs part of the occupied West Bank. We analysed hundreds of satellite images to verify that outposts had been constructed at these locations and to confirm the year they were set up. The BBC also checked social media posts, Israeli government publications and news sources to corroborate this and to show that outposts were still in use. Our analysis suggests almost half (89) of the 196 outposts we verified have been built since 2019. Some of these are linked to growing violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. Earlier this year, the British government sanctioned eight extremist settlers for inciting or perpetrating violence against Palestinians. At least six had established, or are living on, illegal outposts. Responding to our findings in this article, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement: “We strongly condemn the unprecedented levels of settler violence against the Palestinian community, as shown in the report, and have urged the Israeli authorities to end the culture of impunity and clamp down on those responsible. ”A former commander of the Israeli army in the West Bank, Avi Mizrahi, says most settlers are law-abiding Israeli citizens, but he does admit the existence of outposts makes violence more likely. “Whenever you put outposts illegally in the area, it brings tensions with the Palestinians… living in the same area,” he says. One of the extremist settlers sanctioned by the UK was Moshe Sharvit - the man Ayesha says threatened her at gunpoint. Both he and the outpost he set up less than 800m (0.5miles) from Ayesha's home, were also sanctioned by the US government in March. His outpost was described as a “base from which he perpetrates violence against Palestinians”. “He’s made our life hell,” Ayesha says, who must now live with her son in a town close to Nablus. Outposts lack any official Israeli planning approval - unlike settlements, which are larger, typically urban, Jewish enclaves built throughout the West Bank, legal under Israeli law. Both are considered illegal under international law, which forbids moving a civilian population into an occupied territory. But many settlers living in the West Bank claim that, as Jews, they have a religious and historical connection to the land. In July, the UN’s top court, in a landmark opinion, said Israel should stop all new settlement activity and evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel rejected the opinion as “fundamentally wrong” and one-sided. Despite outposts having no legal status, there is little evidence that the Israeli government has been trying to prevent their rapid growth in numbers. The BBC has seen new evidence showing how two organisations with close ties to the Israeli state have provided money and land used to set up new outposts in the West Bank. One is the World Zionist Organization (WZO), an international body founded more than a century ago and instrumental in the establishment of the state of Israel. It has a Settlement Division - responsible for managing large areas of the land occupied by Israel since 1967. The division is funded entirely by Israeli public funds and describes itself as an “arm of the Israeli state”. Contracts obtained by Peace Now, and analysed by the BBC, show the Settlement Division has repeatedly allocated land on which outposts have been built. In the contracts, the WZO forbids the building of any structures and says the land should only be used for grazing or farming - but satellite imagery reveals that, in at least four cases, illegal outposts were built on it. One of these contracts was signed by Zvi Bar Yosef in 2018. He - like Moshe Sharvit - was sanctioned by the UK and US earlier this year for violence and intimidation against Palestinians. We contacted the WZO to ask if it was aware that multiple tracts of land it had allocated for grazing and farming were being used for the construction of illegal outposts. It did not respond. We also put questions to Zvi Bar Yosef, but received no reply. The BBC has also uncovered two documents revealing that another key settler organisation - Amana - loaned hundreds of thousands of shekels to help establish outposts. In one case, the organisation loaned NIS 1,000,000 ($270,000/£205,000) to a settler to build greenhouses on an outpost considered illegal under Israeli law. Amana was founded in 1978 and has worked closely with the Israeli government to build settlements throughout the West Bank ever since. But in recent years, there has been growing evidence that Amana also supports outposts. In a recording from a meeting of executives in 2021, leaked by an activist, Amana’s CEO Ze’ev Hever can be heard stating that: “In the last three years… one operation we have expanded is the herding farm [outposts]. ”“Today, the area [they control] is almost twice the size of built settlements. ”This year, the Canadian government included Amana in a round of sanctions against individuals and organisations responsible for “violent and destabilising actions against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank”. The sanctions did not mention outposts. The BBC contacted Amana to ask why it was providing loans used to establish outposts. It did not respond. There is also a trend of the Israeli government retroactively legalising outposts - effectively transforming them into settlements. Last year, for example, the government began the process of legalising at least 10 outposts, and granted at least six others full legal status. In February, Moshe Sharvit - the settler Ayesha Shtayyeh says evicted her from her home - hosted an open day at his outpost, filmed by a local camera crew. Speaking candidly, he laid out just how effective outposts can be for capturing land. “The biggest regret when we [settlers] built settlements was that we got stuck within the fences and couldn’t expand,” he told the crowd. “The farm is very important, but the most important thing for us is the surrounding area. ”He claimed he now controls about 7,000 dunams (7 sq km) of land - an area greater than many large, urban settlements in the West Bank with populations in the thousands. Gaining control over large areas, often at the expense of Palestinian communities, is a key goal for some settlers who set up and live on outposts, says Hagit Ofran of Peace Now. “Settlers who live on the hilltop [outposts] see themselves as ‘protecting lands’ and their daily job is to kick out Palestinians from the area,” she says. Ayesha says that Moshe Sharvit began a campaign of harassment and intimidation almost as soon as he set up his outpost in late 2021. When her husband, Nabil, grazed his goats in pastures he had used for decades, Sharvit would quickly arrive in an all-terrain vehicle and he and young settlers would chase the animals away, he says. “I responded that we’d leave if the government, or police, or judge tells us to,” Nabil says. “He told me: ‘I’m the government, and I’m the judge, and I’m the police. ’” Settlements Above The LawExtremist settlers are receiving money and land from powerful groups with ties to the Israeli government and are using it to build illegal settlement outposts, BBC Eye reveals. Watch on iPlayer or, if you are outside the UK, watch on YouTube, external West Bank: settlers, guns and sanctionsFor more than six months, a BBC Eye team has been investigating extremist settlers establishing a new type of illegal settlement known as a “herding outpost”. Listen now on BBC Sounds  Through limiting access to grazing land, outpost settlers like Moshe Sharvit are able to put Palestinian farmers in increasingly precarious positions, says Moayad Shaaban, the head of the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission. “It reaches a point where Palestinians don’t have anything anymore. They can’t eat, they can’t graze, can’t get water,” he says. Following the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel and Israel’s war in Gaza, Moshe Sharvit’s harassment became even more aggressive, says Ariel Moran, who supports Palestinian communities facing settler aggression. Sharvit had always carried a pistol with him in the fields, but now he began approaching activists and Palestinians with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder and his threats became more menacing, Ariel says. “I think he saw the chance of taking a shortcut and not waiting for another year or two years of gradually wearing them [Palestinian families] out. “Just do it overnight. And it worked. ”Many of the families, like Ayesha’s, who say they left their homes following threats from Moshe Sharvit, did so in the weeks immediately following 7 October. Throughout the West Bank, OCHA - the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - says settler violence has reached “unprecedented levels”. In the past 10 months, it has recorded more than 1,100 settler attacks against Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and more than 230 injured by settlers since 7 October, it says. At least five settlers have been killed and at least 17 injured by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same time frame, OCHA says. In December 2023, two months after they say they were forced from their home, we filmed Ayesha and Nabil as they returned to collect some of their belongings. When they arrived at the house, they found it had been ransacked. In the kitchen, the cupboards hung from their hinges. In the living room, someone had taken a knife to the sofas, slashing through the upholstery. “I didn’t hurt him. I didn’t do anything to him. What have I done to deserve this?” Ayesha said. As they began to sort through the damage, Moshe Sharvit arrived in a buggy. Before long, the Israeli police and army arrived. They told the couple, and the Israeli peace activists accompanying them, that they had to leave the area. “He hasn’t left anything for us,” Ayesha told the BBC. We contacted Moshe Sharvit on multiple occasions to ask for his response to the allegations made against him, but he did not respond. In July 2024, the BBC approached him in person at his outpost to seek his response to allegations and also to ask if he would allow Palestinians - like Ayesha - to return to the area. He said he didn’t know what we were talking about and denied that he was Moshe Sharvit.

They held a news conference in London, along with the relatives of other British-Israelis murdered on 7 October, following a memorial event at Downing Street. Earlier, they met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Lawyers for the hostages said the families had received a message of support from the King and Queen. A statement issued by the Foreign Office said: “Their Majesties have asked us to convey that they continue to keep you and all hostage families in their special thoughts and offer their prayers for your strength and endurance during such a dreadfully difficult and agonising time for you. ”One of the relatives, Steve Brisley, said it felt like the “cold-blooded brutal murders” of his family - “all three who were British citizens” - have been forgotten. His British sister Lianne and UK-Israeli nieces Noiya and Yahel Sharabi were murdered on 7 October. His brother-in-law Eli is still a hostage. “It was an act of terrorism” he said. “It is 51 weeks since my family was torn apart, 51 weeks since Eli was taken. . . I call on my government to do better, to do more, to bring them home. ”At Monday's news conference, along with the other hostage families, he called on the UK government to table their own UK plan to get their relatives released - and on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a deal to free the hostages. The relatives also expressed concern that if Israel launched a limited ground incursion into Lebanon it would take away the focus from trying to free the hostages. They said it was time for the UK government to take a more “hands-on approach” on working to free their family members who are still being held in Gaza. Ayelet Svatitzky’s British-Israeli brothers, Nadav and Roi Popplewell, were killed. She said a month ago she had ""stood in front of my brothers’ graves and said my final goodbye"". Nadav was taken hostage, forced to record a video while held and his body was recovered from Gaza in August. ""My mum who just turned 80 lost both her sons. She is dealing with that trauma and the trauma of being kidnapped from her home. ""I am here pleading to everyone not to forget what happened on 7 October, not to forget the 101 hostages. ”Sharone Lifschitz is British-Israeli. Her father, 84-year-old Oded, is still being held. Her mother Yocheved was released last October. Ms Lifschitz said the families had had a fruitful meeting with the prime minister. “I think the British government can and should do more. . . we are still in the 7th of October [and] we are fighting for their lives. ""I don’t know if my father is dead or alive… we want the British government to see the hostages with British links as their problem. ”Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,615 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Families of Gaza hostages call on UK government to 'do more',Families of Gaza hostages call on UK government to 'do more',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3dvpj2y1m7o,articles/article_2938.txt,results/article_2938.txt.json

Bernard Cowan was one of 1,200 victims of the 7 October assault. He was shot dead outside the home he shared with his family on Kibbutz Sufa. His sister, Laura Schosloff, has told the BBC their family is ""broken"" by his death and they are ""missing a great man"". And she expressed the hope that Israelis, Palestinians and the Lebanese would be able to live in harmony. Mr Cowan, who was 57 when he died, grew up in Newton Mearns, attending Netherlee primary school and Mearns Castle high school. He moved to Israel when he was 17 and served with the military on Kibbitz Sufa, where he met his wife, Margaret. He had a life of ""freedom"" on the kibbutz, Ms Schosloff said, regularly gardening, scuba diving and travelling. On the day of the attack, he was at his home with his wife when Hamas gunmen arrived, armed with machine guns and missile launchers. Ms Schosloff told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Bernard loved his life. ""There's a big thorn in my heart today about what's happened. ""He had such a passion for life but he was so content with his life. He just had a wonderful life. "" Ms Schosloff said she was wary in the period after the attack but has spent the past year speaking to people she has met in her work and private life. ""The people I've met, I've told everybody what happened to Bernard because it's so important that everybody knows the human face from it. It's one of our own. ""I love being Scottish. I mean I'm Scottish, British and Jewish and I'm proud of everything. And I love the Scottish people. I haven't had any bad feelings towards me. ""She said she prays for peace in the region, which has been engulfed in fighting since the 7 October attack. ""I would love there to be peace but not just the Israelis. The Palestinians, the Lebanese, I would love there to be peace. ""I want people to be able to go into their own homes; 80,000 Israelis are displaced at the moment. My friends and family are displaced as well as the Palestinians and Lebanese. ""I want them to be able to go to their own homes, be able to bring their children up, be able to get jobs and to be able to live in harmony with their neighbours. "" Following Bernard's death, Ms Schosloff said the close Jewish community in Glasgow mourned his loss together. ""The Jewish community in Glasgow is like a village within a city. Everybody knows everybody else. Our community had lost one of their own and everybody was grieving as well for Bernard. ""It’s one of your own. It’s a boy from Glasgow and a boy who was proud to be Glaswegian. "" One year on, Ms Schosloff said she keeps Bernard's memory alive by sharing stories about him and remembering the good times. The family recently planted a tree in the Jewish cemetery in his memory, paying tribute to his love of gardening. She said: ""It’s important we talk and remember their memories and they’ll never be forgotten. ""Bernard will never be forgotten, he will always be a part of my heart.

2942,2024-09-04 05:11:30.759000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y8zp8zdpzo,"The family of a British aid worker killed in Gaza in April has urged the government to launch an independent legal inquiry into his death. James Kirby was one of three Britons killed in Israeli drone strikes on an aid convoy run by the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity. Ahead of a memorial service for Mr Kirby at Bristol Cathedral on Wednesday, the family also criticised the government for not being in touch since his death and expressed their “surprise” at not receiving any contact or condolence from Israel’s ambassador to the UK or any Israeli official since the attack. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Israel's embassy in London called the incident ""a tragic mistake"" and expressed their ""deepest sorrow"" to James's family, adding that the IDF dismissed two people following an investigation into the incident. Speaking on behalf of the family, James’s cousin, Louise Kirby, said: “There must be a proper, independent inquiry into this attack on innocent aid workers, and for the evidence to be assessed, if appropriate, in a relevant court of law. “However, unfortunately, families have had no contact from the UK Government since James and his colleagues’ deaths, nor have we received any information as to whether a credible, independent investigation is taking place; or of the results of any investigation if it has taken place. ”She added: “I very much hope the prime minister will take our concerns seriously and instigate an appropriate, independent or legal inquiry – not only so we can have transparency and accountability, but so that other British citizens and their families know that their government will act for them, if a foreign state unlawfully kills their loved ones. ”James Kirby, 47, a former serviceman, was one of seven killed in the air strikes on an aid convoy run by WCK on 1 April. Two other Britons – John Chapman, 57, and James Henderson, 33 – were also killed. They were providing security for the convoy moving food to a warehouse in Gaza. The IDF has said a drone operator mistakenly targeted the convoy after thinking it had been taken over by Hamas gunmen. Three missiles were fired in three locations over five minutes. The first missile hit a car and some passengers escaped to another vehicle. That was then hit by a second missile. Some survivors tried to flee in a third car which was also struck. Everyone in the convoy was killed. After an internal investigation, the IDF sacked two officers and formally reprimanded two senior commanders. The evidence from the investigation was passed to the military advocate general - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there had been any criminal conduct. A spokesperson for Israel’s embassy in London said: ""This incident was a tragic mistake and we express our deepest sorrow to James Kirby’s family, the other bereaved families, including those of John Chapman and James Henderson, and the entire World Central Kitchen team, who were doing such vital work in extremely challenging circumstances. ""As outlined by the IDF’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism (FFAM) in the in-depth independent investigation, conducted following the incident, a serious failure was made due to a mistaken identification as well as errors in decision-making. ""In light of this, a brigade fire support commander and brigade chief of staff were dismissed. Once again, we express our deepest condolences and sorrow to the families of the bereaved and the WCK team. ”In the wake of the attack, the then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, called for a “thorough and transparent independent investigation” into what had happened. In the statement, Louise Kirby thanked friends and supporters – including WCK – for their support. She said the family had been touched to receive personal letters of condolence from the King and Queen and the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron. But she said “the murder” of James and his fellow aid workers was “a diabolical tragedy” and the family were “still struggling to find answers and accountability for what happened”. She said that, given Israel had said the strikes were an accident, the family had been surprised not to have had any contact or message of condolence from Israel’s ambassador to the UK, nor from any Israeli official. ""Any family of a loved one who has been killed needs closure. We need to understand how this disaster could have happened,"" she said. ""But this is not just about us. This is about how Britain looks after its own citizens and their families, when a British citizen has been unlawfully killed by another state. ” Ms Kirby added: “We appreciate the compassion and respect we have been shown, but we must also have transparency and accountability. How did this happen? Who is responsible? What accountability did they face? ""Just saying ‘sorry it was an accident’ is not enough. We need to know, and we need to know there has been accountability at all levels, so it never happens again. ”A government spokesman said the bereaved families were being supported by police liaison support officers who were “regular contact” with the Foreign Office. “The death of James and his fellow aid workers was horrific and our thoughts remain with their families,” the spokesperson said. “Attacks on aid workers are never justified and we remain fully committed to their protection as they support some of the most vulnerable people in the world. ”“There must be an immediate ceasefire to protect civilians and aid workers, secure the release of all hostages and ensure much more aid gets into Gaza. Israel must guarantee the protection of aid workers and ensure a tragedy like this cannot happen again. ”The spokesperson did not address the families’ demand for an independent inquiry. Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza  in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October during which about 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Family of aid worker killed in Gaza call for inquiry,Family of aid worker killed in Gaza call for inquiry,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8zp8zdpzo,articles/article_2942.txt,results/article_2942.txt.json

Asser, a boy, and Ayssel, a girl, were just four days old when their father Mohammed Abu al-Qumsan went to collect their birth certificates. While he was away, his neighbours called to say their home in Deir al Balah had been bombed. The strike also killed his wife and the twins' grandmother. “I don’t know what happened,” he said. “I am told it was a shell that hit the house. ”""I didn't even have the time to celebrate them,"" he added. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says 115 infants have been born and then killed during the war. According to AP news agency, the family had followed an order to evacuate Gaza City in the opening weeks of the Israel-Gaza war, seeking shelter in a central part of the strip, as the Israeli army instructed. The BBC has asked the Israeli army for comment on the strike, and is waiting for a response. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas operating in dense residential areas, including using civilian buildings as shelter. But officials rarely comment on individual strikes. Several such shelters in Gaza have been attacked in the past few weeks. On Saturday, an Israeli air strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, the director of a hospital told the BBC. An Israeli military spokesman said the school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denied. Israel disputed the number of dead, but the BBC could not independently verify figures from either side. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

In a statement on Saturday, Unifil said the peacekeeper was injured at its headquarters in the southern city of Naquora on Friday night amid ""ongoing military activity nearby"", though added that it did not know the origin of the fire. ""He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable,"" it said. On Friday US President Joe Biden has said he was ""absolutely, positively"" urging Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon following two earlier incidents on Thursday and Friday. Israeli troops have launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon as part of its escalation against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it has been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis for the past year. Israeli forces have urged UN peacekeepers to leave their positions. A spokesperson for Unifil said on Saturday that there had been a ""unanimous decision"" to stay in the border region. Separately, Unifil said buildings at a position in the village of Ramyah sustained ""significant damage due to explosions from nearby shelling"" on Friday night. ""We remind all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and premises, including avoiding combat activities near Unifil positions,"" the mission said. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged that its troops were responsible for an incident in which two Sri Lankan soldiers, also in Naqoura, were injured. The IDF said soldiers operating near the base opened fire after identifying a threat and that the incident would be investigated ""at the highest levels"". Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemned"" the attack. On Thursday, two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured falling from an observation tower after Israeli tanks fired towards it. Lt Gen Seán Clancy, chief of staff of the Irish Defence Forces, has said he does not believe the strike on Thursday was accidental. Some 340 Irish troops are currently operating in Lebanon with Unifil. ""An observer tower with a round from a tank directly into it, which is a very small target, has to be very deliberate,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. ""So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act. It's a direct act. ""Whether its indiscipline or directed, either way it is not conscionable or allowable. ""The leaders of France, Italy, and Spain have also condemned Israel's actions, saying in a joint statement that they were unjustifiable and should immediately end. On Saturday Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes on villages to the north and south of the capital Beirut had killed nine people. The IDF also told residents of 23 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali river. Hezbollah continued to fire into Israel, with the IDF saying that about 320 projectiles had been identified and a number of them intercepted. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the areas around the northern towns of Zar'it, Shomera, Shtula, Netu’a, and Eben Menachem would be closed to civilians from 20:00 local time (18:00 BST).  About 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel, known as the ""Blue Line"". Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over the past three weeks, Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Hezbollah, intensifying air strikes against southern Lebanon and southern parts of Beirut, assassinating Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and launching a ground invasion. Lebanon says more than 2,000 people have been killed, mainly in the recent escalation, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. This week Hezbollah rocket fire has killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai national, Israeli authorities say.","Fifth peacekeeper wounded in southern Lebanon, UN says","Fifth peacekeeper wounded in southern Lebanon, UN says",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy92zjq508o,articles/article_2945.txt,results/article_2945.txt.json

It read: “You must enter a protected area immediately and remain there until further notice. ”The message was sent by the Israel Defense Forces's Home Front Command and ended with the phrase ""life-saving instructions”. People began to head for shelter in safe rooms as missiles were launched towards Israel from Iran. The sirens sounding across the country were heard by millions. As the wail of the alarm rang outside, we moved to the shelter in the BBC’s Jerusalem Bureau - a secure part of the building with no windows. We could hear frequent booms as missiles flew overhead and were intercepted by Israel’s defence system. Videos captured here and elsewhere shared on social media showed streams of light as the missiles flew over Israel - and clouds of smoke as they were intercepted or detonated on impact. “There’s loads of them,” a contact exclaimed in a video filmed in southern Israel that shows circles of light in the night sky. At about 20:00, the IDF said its aerial defence array was identifying and intercepting the launches, and called on people to “remain in a protected space until further notice”. It continued: “The explosions you are hearing are from interceptions and fallen projectiles. ”Concern had been mounting across Israel as reports emerged early in the evening that Iran was preparing a strike. It came hours after Israeli troops invaded Lebanon, in what its military calls a ""limited, localised and targeted"" ground operation against Hezbollah. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said it launched the missiles in retaliation for recent attacks that killed the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as a senior Iranian commander.

It is very scary indeed… but we are strong and confident that our IDF will protect us. Iran just made a huge mistake. ” About an hour after the first message, phones again vibrated with a new alert from the Home Front Command, telling people they could leave shelters and protected areas. Following the strikes, the IDF spokesperson said there were some hits in central and southern Israel. Videos later shared on social media showed damage from the missiles in multiple locations, including a large crater in the ground near Tel Aviv. The Palestinian civil defence authority in the occupied West Bank city of Jericho said a man there died during the Iranian missile barrage. According to the AFP news agency, which spoke to city governor Hussein Hamayel, the victim was killed by falling rocket debris. Israeli officials have not reported any serious injuries as a result of Tuesday's air attacks. “At this stage we don’t identify more launches from Iran.

2949,2024-08-18 12:22:32.290000+00:00,/news/articles/cyvpm1049d9o,"A British Foreign Office official who worked on counter terrorism has resigned in protest at arms sales to Israel, saying the UK government “may be complicit in war crimes”. Mark Smith wrote to colleagues on Friday, saying he had raised concerns “at every level” in the Foreign Office, including through an official whistle blowing mechanism. Mr Smith, who was based at the British Embassy in Dublin, added he had received nothing more than basic acknowledgments. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) declined to comment on an individual case but said the government was committed to upholding international law. The resignation email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent to a wide set of distribution lists including hundreds of government officials, embassy staff and special advisers to Foreign Office ministers. Details of Mr Smith’s resignation were first broken by the journalist Hind Hassan, external. Mr Smith said he had previously worked in Middle East arms export licensing assessment for the government and “each day” colleagues were witnessing “clear and unquestionable examples” of war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law by Israel in Gaza. “Senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed open genocidal intent, Israeli soldiers take videos deliberately burning, destroying and looting civilian property,” he wrote. “Whole streets and universities have been demolished, humanitarian aid is being blocked and civilians are regularly left with no safe quarter to flee to. Red Crescent ambulances have been attacked, schools and hospitals are regularly targeted. These are War Crimes. ”He said there was “no justification for the UK's continued arms sales to Israel”. The FCDO said Foreign Secretary David Lammy had initiated a review “on day one in office” to assess whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law. While hundreds of officials in the UK, Europe and the US have registered unprecedented levels of dissent at their governments’ policies towards Israel over the war in Gaza, there have been far fewer known cases of so-called principled resignations, meaning Mr Smith’s case is extremely rare for the British government. Details of Mr Smith's resignation first emerged when the journalist Hind Hassan posted a copy of its contents on the social media platform X, external on Friday. According to the email, his role was “Second Secretary Counter Terrorism” - understood to be a relatively junior rank, but one in which he described himself as “a subject matter expert in the domain of arms sales policy” after “a long career in the diplomatic service”. His email continued: “Ministers claim that the UK has one of the most ‘robust and transparent’ arms export licensing regimes in the world, however this is the opposite of the truth. ”“As a fully cleared officer raising serious concerns of illegality in this Department, to be disregarded in this way is deeply troubling. It is my duty as a public servant to raise this. ”A source close to Mr Smith said his email was limited to internal government addressees and he did not resign publicly. Since the story has emerged in public, Mr Smith has issued a statement calling on the government to “listen to the concerns” of civil servants, adding that he was previously the lead author of the central assessment governing the legality of UK arms sales in the Middle East and North Africa Directorate. He said: “It was my job to gather all relevant information regarding civilian casualties, international law compliance as well as assess the commitment and capabilities of the countries in question. ”“To export arms to any nation, the UK must be satisfied that the recipient nation has in place robust procedures to avoid civilian casualties and to minimize harm to civilian life. It is impossible to argue that Israel is doing that. ”“I have written to the Foreign Secretary informing him of my resignation and urging him to urgently review the UK approach to the situation in Gaza. I sincerely hope that he will listen to the concerns of Civil Servants on this issue and make the necessary changes. ”Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?Gaza ceasefire progress is an illusion, says HamasSince 2008, the UK has granted licences for weapons exports to Israel worth £574m ($727m) in total, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT). The UK government has recently played down the scale of the supply, calling it ""relatively small"" at £42m ($53m) in 2022. Israel has repeatedly denied breaching international humanitarian law in Gaza. Responding to previous cases of dissent by Western officials over policy and arms supply, Israel’s government has said it is acting to defeat Hamas as “a genocidal terrorist organisation which commits war crimes as well as crimes against humanity"". In May, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and defence minister, as well as for leaders of Hamas, for war crimes, but these have yet to be issued.

2950,2024-09-14 17:27:30.966000+00:00,/news/articles/cqxrjqz8vrno,"Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a joint US-Turkish citizen who was shot dead in the occupied West Bank last week. A guard of honour carried Eygi’s coffin during the funeral ceremony, which took place in her home district of Didim, in western Turkey. Israel has said it was “highly likely” the 26-year-old activist was killed by its forces during a protest in the West Bank on 6 September. Turkey says it was an intentional killing. Eygi's death has inflamed tensions between the two countries, and several Turkish government officials, including Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz, attended the funeral. Mourners carrying Palestinian and Turkish flags were seen crowding outside Didim’s Central Mosque as proceedings took place. Also among the mourners were Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmus and leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Özgür Özel. ""The blood of Ayşenur Eygi is as sacred as that of every Palestinian martyred, and we will follow it until the end,"" Kurtulmus told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. ""As the Turkish nation, we are fully committed. As a state, we are fully committed. ""Prayers were held for Eygi in cities across Turkey, including Istanbul and the capital Ankara. Her mother, Rabia Birden, said on Friday: ""The only thing I ask of our state is to seek justice for my daughter,"" according to Anadolu news agency. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had previously said it was “highly likely” Eygi was ""hit indirectly and unintentionally"" by IDF fire, which was not “aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot. ”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the killing was “unprovoked and unjustified”. “No-one should be shot and killed for attending a protest, no-one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views,” Blinken told reporters shortly after the IDF released its statement.  Relations between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023. Turkey suspended all imports and exports from Israel in May and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has previously labelled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the ""the butcher of Gaza"". In response to the suspension of trade, Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz accused Mr Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"".",Funeral held for US-Turkish activist killed in West Bank,Funeral held for US-Turkish activist killed in West Bank,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxrjqz8vrno,articles/article_2950.txt,results/article_2950.txt.json
2951,2024-11-25 21:45:47.129000+00:00,/news/articles/c93qevdpzvqo,"Amid severe food shortages in Gaza, increasingly violent thefts by criminal gangs are now the main obstacle to distributing supplies in the south, aid workers and locals say. They allege that armed men operate within plain sight of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a restricted zone by the border. The BBC has learnt that Hamas - sensing an opportunity to regain its faltering control - has reactivated a special security force to combat theft and banditry. After gangsters robbed nearly 100 UN lorries, injuring many of the Palestinian drivers, on 16 November - one of the worst single losses of aid during the war - a number of alleged looters were then killed in an ambush. A notorious Gazan criminal family then blocked the main Salah al-Din Road leading from Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point for two days last week. Witnesses said iron barriers were erected and lorries trying to access the aid distribution point were fired at. “Law and order have broken down in the area around the Kerem Shalom crossing, which remains the main entry point of goods, and gangs are filling the power vacuum,” says Sam Rose, deputy director of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in Gaza. “It’s inevitable after 13 months of intense conflict - things fall apart. ” As the rainy winter weather begins, humanitarian officials say solving the worsening situation is critical to meet the huge, deepening needs of most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population - now displaced to the centre and south. “It is tactical, systematic, criminal looting,” says Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN’s humanitarian office, Ocha, in Gaza. He says this is leading to “ultra-violence” in all directions - “from the looters towards the truckers, from the IDF towards the police, and from the police towards the looters”. There has been increased lawlessness in Gaza since Israel began targeting police officers early this year, citing their role in Hamas governance. “Hamas’s security control dropped to under 20%,” the former head of Hamas police investigations told the BBC, adding: “We are working on a plan to restore control to 60% within a month. ”Some displaced Gazans in the south welcome the new Hamas efforts against criminal gangs. “Killing the thieves who stole aid is a step in the right direction,” exclaims one man, Mohammed Abu Jared. However, others see them as a cynical attempt to take control of lucrative black markets. “Hamas is killing its competitors in stealing aid,” says Mohammed Diab, an activist in Deir al-Balah. “A big mafia has finished off a small mafia. ” Many see Hamas’s attempts to take a lead against the criminality as the direct consequence of Israels’ failure to agree on a post-war plan in Gaza. There are currently no alternatives to replace the Islamist movement and armed group which Israeli leaders pledged to destroy after last year’s deadly 7 October attacks. The chaos comes at a time when aid entering the Palestinian territory has dropped to some of the lowest levels since the start of the war. While the threat of famine is greatest in besieged parts of the north where Israel is conducting a new, intense military offensive, in the south there are also major shortages of food, medicines and other goods. “Prices of basic commodities are sky-rocketing - a bag of flour costs more than $200 (£160), a single egg $15 - or else goods are simply not available,” Sam Rose of Unrwa says. Every day in the past week, Umm Ahmed has stood with her children in a huge queue outside a bakery in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where ultimately some loaves are given out. “My children are very hungry every day. We can’t afford the basics. It’s constant suffering. No food, no water, no cleaning products, nothing,” she says. “We don’t want much, just to live a decent life. We need food. We need goods to come in and be distributed fairly. That’s all we’re asking for. ” The US has been pressing for Israel to allow more aid lorries into Gaza. However, Israeli officials say that the main reason that their goal of 350 a day has not been reached is the inability of the UN and other international aid agencies to bring enough lorries to the crossings. Aid workers reject that. They are urgently calling for many entry restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities to be lifted, and for more crossing points to be opened and secured so they can collect and distribute supplies. They say the breakdown in public order needs to be addressed and that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide protection and security. The BBC was told that thefts often happen in clear sight of Israeli soldiers or surveillance drones - but that the army fails to intervene. Stolen goods are apparently being stored outside or in warehouses in areas under Israeli military control. The IDF did not respond to BBC requests for comment on how it combats organised looting and smuggling. It has previously insisted that it takes countermeasures and works to facilitate the entry of aid. Early in the war, as food became increasingly scarce, desperate Gazans were sometimes seen stealing from incoming aid lorries. Soon, cigarette smuggling became a huge business with gangs holding up convoys at gunpoint after they arrived from Egypt’s Rafah crossing and, after this shut in May, Kerem Shalom. A cigarette packet can sell for exorbitant amounts in Gaza: while a packet of 20 cost about 20 shekels ($5.40) before the war, now a single cigarette can cost 180 shekels ($48.60). Cigarettes are being found within the frames of wooden aid pallets and inside closed food cans, indicating that there is a regional racket involved in smuggling. For the past six weeks, the Israeli authorities have banned commercial imports, arguing that these benefit Hamas. This has added to the decrease in the supply of food, which is in turn driving the rise in armed looting. Stolen goods, from flour to winter shelters, sent as international donations and meant to be given as free handouts to needy people can only be bought at extortionate prices on Gaza’s black market. Meanwhile, months’ worth of donated supplies are being held back in Egypt due to hold-ups in aid delivery. In recent days, local media reports are suggesting that Israel is now studying the option of delivering aid to Gaza by means of a private, armed American security contractor. While nothing has yet been officially announced, aid workers are worried. Georgios Petropoulos of Ocha questions which donor countries would want supplies distributed this way. “How safe is it really going to be?” he asks: “I think it will be a vector for more bloodshed and violence. ”",Gangsters block aid distribution in south Gaza,Gangsters block aid distribution in south Gaza,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93qevdpzvqo,articles/article_2951.txt,results/article_2951.txt.json
2952,2024-11-21 16:48:33.595000+00:00,/news/articles/ckgr4n0720eo,"The announcement of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant has triggered a furious response from across Israel's political spectrum. By contrast it has been welcomed by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and ordinary citizens in Gaza. Israel's President Isaac Herzog called it ""a dark day for justice and humanity"", saying the decision had ""chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom"". Netanyahu's office called it ""an antisemitic decision"" and said that Israel ""utterly rejects the false and absurd charges"", labelling the ICC ""a biased and discriminatory political body"". The chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Yuli Edelstein, called it ""a shameful decision by a political body held captive by Islamist interests"". Israel's foreign minister said the ICC had lost its legitimacy. Hamas has welcomed the decision, without commenting on the issuing of a warrant for its own military commander, Mohammed Deif. In a statement it said: ""We call on all countries around the world to cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against defenceless civilians in the Gaza Strip"". Ordinary Palestinians in Gaza have also welcomed the announcement. Muhammad Ali, a 40-year old man displaced from Gaza City and currently in the central area of Deir al-Balah, said:""We have been terrorised, starved, had our homes destroyed, and lost our children, sons, and loved ones. We welcome this decision, and of course, we hope that the decisions of the ICC will be implemented"". Munira Al-Shami, whose sister was killed by Israeli forces last month, called the ICC decision ""justice for tens of thousands of victims, including my sister Wafa"". Meanwhile, some Israeli citizens said the arrests went against Israel's right to defend itself. ""Somehow I'm not surprised,"" Ron Ackerman said, adding he thinks the ICC ""is purely antisemitic and it doesn't see what's going on around Israel, only they look at Israel"". Helen Kariv from Jerusalem said: ""When I first heard it I said, 'my God, where did they get the idea of arresting the prime minister of the state of Israel and his chief of staff'?. . . We are fighting for survival. "" A total of 124 countries are signatories to the ICC, including the UK, but not the US, Russia, China, nor Israel itself. So this means that technically, if either Netanyahu or Gallant sets foot in any of the signatory countries they must be arrested and handed over to the court. But international lawyers have expressed doubts over whether either man will ever be brought to The Hague for trial. The last time Netanyahu travelled outside Israel was in July to the US,  a country he could still theoretically visit with impunity. Last year he visited several countries, including the UK in March, many of which are signatories. It is thought unlikely he would want to risk arrest by doing this again and the countries in question would also be reluctant to find themselves put in that position.  Hamas has little to fear from the ICC warrant for Ibrahim Al-Masri, aka Mohammed Deif. Israel believes he was killed earlier this year, although this was never confirmed by Hamas. The other two Hamas figures whom the ICC originally planned to prosecute – Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh – are both confirmed as dead. There is no question that Thursday’s announcement is a major blow to Israel’s international standing, to the two individuals named and most specifically to Israel’s ongoing efforts to present its military campaign in Gaza as a fight between the forces of good and evil. Israelis are appalled that, in their eyes, the world seems to have already forgotten or overlooked the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October last year. Palestinians, especially Gazans, feel vindicated that their accusations of Israeli war crimes have now been echoed by an international body with some weight.",Gardner: ICC warrants 'major blow to Israel's standing',Gardner: ICC warrants 'major blow to Israel's standing',israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgr4n0720eo,articles/article_2952.txt,results/article_2952.txt.json
2953,2024-10-28 20:05:30.295000+00:00,/news/articles/c4gp2ejzpxeo,"Israel's parliament has voted to pass legislation banning the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, accusing the organisation of colluding with Hamas in Gaza. Contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will be banned within three months, severely limiting the agency's ability to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Co-operation with the Israeli military - which controls all crossings into Gaza - is essential for Unrwa to transfer aid into the territory. It is the main UN organisation working on the ground there. Several countries, including the US and the UK, have expressed serious concern about the move.  US State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, urged Israel to reconsider the ban, saying Unrwa is “irreplaceable” right now in delivering humanitarian aid in Gaza. Follow live updates: Israel moves to ban UnrwaUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the laws risk making Unrwa's ""essential work for Palestinians impossible, jeopardising the entire international humanitarian response in Gaza"". UN chief Antonio Guterres said the move would have ""devastating consequences for Palestine refugees"". Almost all of the enclave's population of more than two million people are dependent on aid and services from the agency. But Israel has objected to Unrwa for decades, with its opposition intensifying in recent years. Israel says Unrwa staff have colluded with Hamas in Gaza, and claimed 19 Unrwa workers took part in the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. The UN investigated Israel’s claim and fired nine of those accused, but it said Israel had not provided evidence for broader allegations. Unrwa insists that dealings with Hamas are purely to enable the agency to do its job. The accusations against Unrwa prompted many Western countries including the US and UK to withdraw their funding earlier this year, but most have since reinstated their support. Israel's parliament, the Knesset, approved the two bills by an overwhelming majority on Monday evening. The new laws will also see Unrwa staff lose their legal immunity within Israel, and the agency's headquarters in East Jerusalem will be closed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that ""Unrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable"", but added that ""sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza"". ""We stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel's security,"" he said on X. Presenting the legislation, Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the Knesset's foreign affairs and security committee, accused Unrwa of being used as a ""cover for terrorist actions"". ""There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and Unrwa, and Israel cannot put up with it,"" he said in parliament. Unrwa - the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees - has over decades provided a range of services and support including healthcare and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza. Since the war broke out last year, the agency's presence on the ground has made it a crucial part of efforts to get humanitarian supplies to civilians, almost all of whom are dependent on aid for survival. About two-and-half million Palestinians are registered with Unrwa in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. In northern Gaza, where Israeli troops are conducting military operations against Hamas fighters, hundreds of thousands of people are living in increasingly desperate conditions. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that ""the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation"". Many Palestinians believe the Israeli military is implementing a ""surrender or starve"" plan in Gaza's north, which would see the forced displacement of all of the estimated 400,000 civilians there to the south, followed by a siege of any remaining Hamas fighters. The Israeli military has denied having such a plan and says Israel says it takes steps to minimise civilian casualties, including issuing evacuation orders. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to its 7 October attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.

However, a senior Hamas official told the BBC there had been no progress and mediators were ""selling illusions"". Israel said it ""appreciates the efforts of the US and the mediators to dissuade Hamas from its refusal to a hostage release deal"". The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. In a recent joint statement, the US, Qatar and Egypt stated that they had presented a proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal that ""narrows the gaps"" between Israel and Hamas. Israel has said any ceasefire deal would require the release of the remaining hostages. Some have already been released, while others are thought to have died in Gaza. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza are calling the current negotiations as the ""last chance"" to get some of them out alive. After 10 months of war and thousands of casualties, there is overwhelming pressure for a breakthrough. A wider regional conflict, in the event of talks between Israel and Hamas collapsing completely, is a distinct possibility and is something all of those involved are fearful of. The mediators said that the past two days of ceasefire discussions had been ""serious, constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere"", external. Technical teams are expected to continue working over the coming days on the details of how to implement the proposed terms before senior government officials meet again in Cairo, hoping to reach an agreement on the terms set out in Doha. While the mediators' statement is clearly a positive development, there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire is agreed. This is not the first time the Mr Biden has said he thought a deal was close - and not everyone shares his cautious optimism. Neither Hamas nor the Israeli government have been quite so upbeat in their responses. Israel says its position and core principles have remained unchanged and were ""well-known"". It accused Hamas of refusing to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. Above all else, Israelis want to see the remaining hostages released but many are sceptical that is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s primary goal. He has insisted that a ""total victory"" over Hamas is his government’s priority. Meanwhile, Hamas’s new leader, Yaya Sinwar, continues to show few signs of compromise. Asked about President Biden’s statement, the senior Hamas official told the BBC ""what we have received from the mediators is very disappointing. There has been no progress"". Hamas is understood to have dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire in favour of Mr Biden's proposal for a six-week pause in which an end to the war could be brokered. Mr Biden's ceasefire proposal also included the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the return of dead hostages' remains. The ""bridging proposal"" put forward by US, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators will be the subject of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s negotiations in the region and should form the basis for the next talks in Cairo at which all parties, including Hamas, are expected to attend. That proposal reportedly ""closes the remaining gaps"" between the two sides’ positions which could allow for “a rapid implementation of the agreement”. It might sound straightforward, but there are big obstacles to overcome and there is still absolutely no trust between senior Israeli or Hamas figures. They’re being dragged to the table - perhaps against their wishes - by others fearful of what could happen in the event of failure. Hamas and its allies are convinced the US administration is trying to buy more time. If Iran attacks Israel, it will appear as if it is Hamas which undermined the negotiations. Hamas does not hide its desire for Iran and Hezbollah to attack Israel and for the escalation to turn into a regional war. They believe a strong blow to Israel will weaken Mr Netanyahu and push him to accept a deal. For his part, Mr Biden warned ""no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". Meanwhile, Israel's military operation in Gaza continues, with an air strike in the early hours of Saturday morning killing 15 people in the al-Zawaida neighbourhood of central Gaza, according to the Palestinian civil defence authority, a rescue service. Spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency nine children and three women were among the dead. Israel has not commented directly. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday morning it had ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in central Gaza, including one that had fired at Israeli forces operating in the area. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah - further shrinking the humanitarian zone in which  thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. Israel said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians ""due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: ""Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go. ""Pressing the need for a ceasefire deal is the circulation of the polio virus - which can spread through faecal matter - is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in Gaza.

Qatar, Egypt and the US said in a joint statement, external that the past two days of discussions in Doha were “serious, constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere”. Senior officials would meet again in Cairo before the end of next week with the aim of finalising an agreement, they added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Israel on Saturday to intensify the diplomatic efforts. US President Joe Biden declared that “we are closer than we’ve ever been” to a ceasefire, but a senior Hamas official expressed scepticism. At the very least, this is a statement that buys more time, given the tensions in the region and the threats of retaliation against Israel from Iran for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut last month. Any sign of progress in the Qatar talks was regarded as essential by governments desperate to avoid the war in Gaza spiralling into an all-out regional conflict. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead.

Technical teams will continue to work over the coming days on the details of implementation before senior government officials meet again in Cairo, hoping to reach an agreement on the terms set out in Doha. The statement ended by citing the American, Qatari and Egyptian leaders as warning that there was “no more time to waste and no excuses for further delay”. “The path is now clear to achieve this outcome, save lives, bring relief to the people of Gaza, and calm regional tensions,” it added. Later, Mr Biden told reporters at the White House: ""I don't want to jinx anything. . . we may have something. But we're not there yet. ”In a later statement, the US president added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was travelling to the Middle East in part ""to underscore that with the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage release deal now in sight, no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". While the mediators' statement is clearly a positive development, there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire is agreed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office was more cautious than Mr Biden, saying he appreciated the efforts to “dissuade Hamas from its refusal on a deal that would release the hostages”. ""Israel's core principles are well known to the US and the mediators, and Israel hopes their pressure will lead Hamas to accept the terms of 27 May, so the details of the agreement can be implemented,"" it added. A senior figure from Hamas - which did not participate in the talks, but was in contact with Qatari and Egyptian officials - told the BBC: “What the movement’s leadership was informed of today regarding the results of the Doha ceasefire meetings does not include a commitment to implement what was agreed upon on 2 July. ”The first phase of the deal outlined by President Biden, based on Israel’s 27 May proposal, would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. Before the talks resumed on Thursday afternoon, a Hamas official had said the key sticking points included Israel’s demand that it had full control over the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and that displaced people returning to northern Gaza be screened at the Israeli-controlled Netzarim corridor that effectively divides the territory in two. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC after Friday’s talks ended that Israel had “shown flexibility on one outstanding issue - its veto of the names of some Palestinian prisoners”. But, they said, it had “insisted on maintaining a military presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim checkpoint during the first phase of the deal”, and “stipulated that those returning to northern Gaza would be inspected”. Earlier, the UN made an urgent appeal for two seven-day pauses in the fighting in Gaza starting later this month to allow the vaccination of more than 640,000 Palestinian children against polio. In recent weeks, traces of the poliovirus - which is spread through faecal matter - have been detected in sewage samples collected in the southern city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. That means the virus is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. ""Let’s be clear: The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said. “But in any case, a polio pause is a must. It is impossible to conduct a polio vaccination campaign with war raging all over. ""Earlier, the Israeli military issued a new evacuation order for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah, further shrinking the humanitarian zone. It said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians “due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: “Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go.

It accused Hamas of refusing to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. Above all else, Israelis want to see the remaining hostages released but many are sceptical that is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s primary goal. He has insisted that a ""total victory"" over Hamas is his government’s priority. Meanwhile, Hamas’s new leader, Yaya Sinwar, continues to show few signs of compromise. Asked about President Biden’s statement, the senior Hamas official told the BBC ""what we have received from the mediators is very disappointing. There has been no progress"". Hamas is understood to have dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire in favour of Mr Biden's proposal for a six-week pause in which an end to the war could be brokered. Mr Biden's ceasefire proposal also included the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the return of dead hostages' remains. The ""bridging proposal"" put forward by US, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators will be the subject of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s negotiations in the region and should form the basis for the next talks in Cairo at which all parties, including Hamas, are expected to attend. That proposal reportedly ""closes the remaining gaps"" between the two sides’ positions which could allow for “a rapid implementation of the agreement”. It might sound straightforward, but there are big obstacles to overcome and there is still absolutely no trust between senior Israeli or Hamas figures. They’re being dragged to the table - perhaps against their wishes - by others fearful of what could happen in the event of failure. Hamas and its allies are convinced the US administration is trying to buy more time. If Iran attacks Israel, it will appear as if it is Hamas which undermined the negotiations. Hamas does not hide its desire for Iran and Hezbollah to attack Israel and for the escalation to turn into a regional war. They believe a strong blow to Israel will weaken Mr Netanyahu and push him to accept a deal. For his part, Mr Biden warned ""no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". Meanwhile, Israel's military operation in Gaza continues, with an air strike in the early hours of Saturday morning killing 15 people in the al-Zawaida neighbourhood of central Gaza, according to the Palestinian civil defence authority, a rescue service. Spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency nine children and three women were among the dead. Israel has not commented directly. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday morning it had ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in central Gaza, including one that had fired at Israeli forces operating in the area. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah - further shrinking the humanitarian zone in which  thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. Israel said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians ""due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: ""Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go. ""Pressing the need for a ceasefire deal is the circulation of the polio virus - which can spread through faecal matter - is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in Gaza. ""Let’s be clear: The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said.","Gaza ceasefire progress is an illusion, says Hamas","Gaza ceasefire progress is an illusion, says Hamas","israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gdewq4v8wo,articles/article_2956.txt,results/article_2956.txt.json
2957,2024-10-24 18:09:59.801000+00:00,/news/articles/cvg742e3rexo,"Negotiations over a potential Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are set to resume in Doha in the coming days, officials from the US, Israel and Qatar have said. A spokesperson for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an Israeli delegation will travel to Qatar on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether Hamas has agreed to participate in the talks. The US believes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week - seen as one of the group's most extreme figures - may open the door to an agreement, though Hamas has accused Israel of being the primary block to any deal. “With Sinwar gone,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told journalists, “there is a real opportunity to bring [the hostages] home and to accomplish the objective. ”That objective, Mr Blinken said, was to reach a deal ""so that Israel can withdraw, so that Hamas cannot reconstitute, and so that the Palestinian people can rebuild their lives and rebuild their futures"". Qatar’s foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Qatari mediators had ""re-engaged"" with Hamas since Sinwar's death, but there was “no clarity” over the groups current plans with regards to ceasefire talks. ""There has been an engagement with the representatives from the political office in Doha. We had some meetings with them in the last couple of days,"" he said, adding that Egypt was also in ""ongoing"" discussions with Hamas. A Hamas delegation met with Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo on Thursday evening to discuss the situation in Gaza, one senior Palestinian official and one Egyptian official told the BBC. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a post on X that he welcomes Egypt's ""readiness to advance a deal for the release of the hostages"". Previous discussions over the long-sought after deal have centred around a proposal from US President Joe Biden in May, which was “positively” received by Hamas. That proposal laid out a three-step plan that would begin with a six-week ceasefire, in which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. There would also be a ""surge"" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners. It would eventually lead to a permanent ""cessation of hostilities"" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. But talks faltered, with a key sticking-point being Netanyahu's insistence on an Israeli troop presence on the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi corridor. Blinken is on his 11th visit to the Middle East since the start of the current war between Israel and Hamas more than a year ago, and is set to end his trip on Friday. During the visit, he announced an additional $135 million of aid “in humanitarian assistance, water, sanitation, maternal health for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank, as well as in the region”, taking the total amount of US aid since the start of the war to some $1.2 billion.

Kate White, 44, from York, a member of Manchester-based charity UK-Med, was deployed to the region earlier this year to help teams working in two hospitals. Ms White said she had first carried out aid work in Libya in 2011 and had since also worked in Iraq and Syria and had responded to Ebola outbreaks in Africa. However, Gaza was currently ""like a warzone on steroids, in terms of other places I’ve been to"", she said. Ms White said her latest challenge had involved preparing medics for a cholera outbreak, while being rocked by nearby explosions as the Israel-Gaza war continued. She said: “I’ve been training medics in terms of responding to outbreaks because sewage is one of the biggest risk factors in disease transmission. “We’ve seen in many other warzones that these are the moments where you end up with an emergency within an emergency because you have an outbreak in the middle of war. “We’ve seen polio already start to have a resurgence in Gaza, and it’s a matter of time before the next disease hits. ”Ms White said she had seen an “indescribable level of destruction” which had resulted in raw sewage overflowing on the streets. She said Gaza had ""seen destruction and its population being moved from place to place in a way I have never seen before"". “The health system has been completely disrupted to a level that took years in other places,"" she added. With funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UK-Med has treated more than 110,000 people since January. Many of the medics who staff the UK-Med hospitals in Al Mawasi and Deir El Balah, along the Gaza Strip, have also come from the NHS, with 26 NHS staff having been rotated through Gaza so far. In July, Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced a further £5.5m for UK-Med to fund its humanitarian assistance and medical treatment in Gaza. Anneliese Dodds, minister of state for development, said: ""In Gaza and elsewhere, aid workers from around the UK are operating in some of the most dangerous places in the world, treating the most vulnerable. “The UK’s official Emergency Medical Team pools medical expertise from across the country to make a real difference in reacting to humanitarian disasters around the globe. “The government is proud to support their crucial work.

""My entire family has been wiped out in an instant"", says Ashraf El Attar, ""leaving me with nothing"". The nurse - who works at Gaza's European hospital - says his family home in Deir-al-Balah was hit in the early hours of Sunday morning. He survived with minor injuries. Israel has not spoken about this specific attack, but has said its forces were operating in the city. It says it only targets members of armed groups. Killed in the strike were Mr El Attar's wife - Hala Khattab, a teacher - and their six children - a 15-year-old boy, a one-year-old girl, and their four 10-year-old quadruplets. Speaking to BBC Arabic's Gaza Today podcast, the nurse says that around 6am on the morning of the attack he was getting ready for work when he ""heard the alarm sound and suddenly lost consciousness"". When he came to, Mr El Attar says he was in ""severe pain"" and the house ""was in ruins"". All the outer walls of their apartment building were destroyed. ""I desperately called out for my children and my wife, but it was too late. ""My six children, including four twins, and my wife were killed instantly in the attack,"" he says. The strike took them by surprise, Mr El Attar says. The night before, the family had spent time ""enjoying a soap opera together"", trying to ""escape the harsh reality of war"". Mr El Attar's mother - and grandmother to his six children - says she ""cannot comprehend"" why their home was hit. ""My son Ashraf works as a nurse at the European hospital, where he is dedicated to helping patients. ""We had no connections with any organisations,"" she says. The couple had an ""incredibly challenging time"" raising their children, she says, in particular the quadruplets. ""The babies faced severe health issues in their early months and nearly died. ""We provided oxygen cylinders at home, and one of them, Hammam, underwent hernia surgery,"" she says. Mr El Attar says his wife - Hala - was ""dedicated"" to helping displaced people. She was working for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), he says, a UN agency that provides support for Palestinian refugees. Now the nurse says he is forced to come to terms with the life they could have had together. ""I worked tirelessly to support my family and watch my children grow up, dreaming of giving them a better future - a big house, a car, and mobile phones,"" he says. But now ""all those dreams have been destroyed"". ""I demand justice for my family"", he says, something he vows to pursue through ""any international court"". ""Israel has committed a grave injustice. My entire family has been wiped out in an instant, leaving me with nothing. ""The Israel Defense Forces has not commented on this specific strike, but has said it was operating in Deir al-Balah over the weekend. In another statement on Monday, it said it had been operating in the outskirts of Deir al-Balah ""eliminating terrorists, destroying combat compounds above and below ground"". It says it only targets members of armed groups, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas - who it says places fighters, weapons, tunnels and rockets in residential areas. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Gaza nurse says whole family, including quadruplets, killed in air strike","Gaza nurse says whole family, including quadruplets, killed in air strike","israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyn31g50e3o,articles/article_2959.txt,results/article_2959.txt.json
2960,2024-11-02 08:00:06.207000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2mnlg43k4o,"A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza is expected to resume on Sunday, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) said six people, including four children, were injured following a strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic. The agency did not say who was responsible for the attack but an official from Gaza's civil defence agency told AFP news agency it was carried out by an Israeli quadcopter. Israel said it is investigating but does not believe it was responsible. Unicef, the UN's children's agency which is helping to lead the vaccination rollout, described the strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic as ""another example of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians"". The second phase of the vaccine rollout began on Saturday after being postponed in October due to intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access in the region. Gaza recorded its first case of polio in 25 years in August, which left a baby boy paralysed and prompted the rollout of the programme. The immunisations are resuming as 15 UN and humanitarian organisations have described the situation in north Gaza as ""apocalyptic"" nearly a month after an Israeli ground offensive began. A humanitarian pause in the fighting has been agreed upon to allow vaccinations to restart in Gaza City, the WHO said. The campaign will run for three days. In a post on X on Saturday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said the centre was struck ""while parents were bringing their children to the life-saving polio vaccination in an area where a humanitarian pause was agreed"". In a separate incident in Jabalia, Unicef says a car driven by a staff member “came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter”, according to the agency's head, Catherine Russell. She said the driver was unhurt but was left “deeply shaken” and called for Israel to launch an investigation. About 15,000 children under 10 years old in towns across north Gaza, such as Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, ""still remain inaccessible"" and will be missed by the vaccination campaign, compromising its effectiveness, the agency said. The WHO had aimed to give 119,000 children in the area a second dose of the oral polio vaccine. The agency added that achieving this target ""is now unlikely due to access constraints"". The first round of the vaccine campaign successfully reached 559,000 children under 10 years old over three phases in south, central and north Gaza between 1 and 12 September, during which there were local “humanitarian pauses” agreed by Israel and Palestinian groups. However, the area agreed in the latest humanitarian pause ""has been substantially reduced"" compared to the first round of vaccinations and is now limited to just Gaza City, according to the WHO. From the start of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, medical experts stressed that delays in administering the second dose could jeopardise overall efforts to halt transmission of the contagious, potentially deadly disease. To interrupt transmission, at least 90% of all children need to be given a minimum of two doses. The UN human rights chief said last week that the Gaza war's “darkest moment” is unfolding in the north of the territory. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the Israeli military launched a ground offensive in Beit Lahia as well as neighbouring Jabalia and Beit Hanoun on 6 October, saying it was acting against regrouping Hamas fighters. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from north Gaza towards Gaza City for safety, the WHO said. The joint statement from UN agencies, including the WHO, released on Friday, said the situation was ""apocalyptic"", with the entire Palestinian population in the area ""at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence"". The UN estimates that about 100,000 residents remain in dire conditions, with severe shortages of food, water and medical supplies. The US warned Israel this week to immediately increase humanitarian aid into Gaza as a deadline approaches to boost aid or face cuts to American military assistance. The US envoy to the UN said on Tuesday that Israel's words ""must be matched by action"", which was ""not happening"". Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel does not allow international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it difficult to verify facts on the ground.

2961,2024-08-31 19:00:48.912000+00:00,/news/articles/c4gl62rvvp8o,"The first full day of a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children against polio in Gaza has been successful, the UN says. The rollout relies on a series of localised pauses in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters, and the first three-day window began on Sunday. ""So far, it's going well and the turnaround is really good,” Salim Oweis, a spokesman for the UN children’s fund Unicef, told the BBC. To be effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) says at least 90% of children under 10 must be immunised in a short time frame. The drive follows the first confirmed case of polio in 25 years in Gaza. On Thursday, the WHO announced an agreement with Israel for limited pauses in the fighting to allow the polio vaccination programme to take place. Around 1.3 million doses of the vaccine were recently brought in through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint by Unicef. The agency has had to keep them in cold storage in its warehouse at the correct temperature to maintain their potency. Another shipment of 400,000 doses is set to be delivered to Gaza soon. On Sunday, Palestinians were able to take their children to three health centres in central Gaza in the first phase of the campaign, which will later extend to the north and the south. Nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated at the Deir el-Balah clinic alone, said UN spokeswoman Louise Wateridge. Among the parents who rushed their children to receive doses was Ghadir Hajji, a mother of five. ""They absolutely have to be vaccinated,"" she told AFP news agency as the family waited in line.  ""We received text messages from the ministry of health and we showed up right away. ""Each “humanitarian pause” is set to last from 06:00 until 15:00 local time over three days, with the possibility of adding an extra day if needed. Unicef's Jonathan Crickx says it is crucial that these temporary truces hold. “You cannot lead and implement a polio vaccination campaign in an active combat zone. It’s simply impossible,” he says. Israel agrees to pauses in fighting for polio vaccine driveBaby contracts Gaza's first case of polio in 25 yearsWHO 'extremely worried' about possible Gaza polio outbreak“Families need to be feeling safe in bringing their children to get the vaccines. But also, the healthcare workers need to be able to safely reach the communities. ”“This is a huge endeavour,” Mr Crickx adds. “Especially in a place like the Gaza Strip where we know that, for example, roads have been damaged, that access is problematic, that security incidents take place on a daily basis. ”One doctor involved in the operation, Dr Mohammed Salha, told the BBC that one of the main challenges facing the drive was the lack of fuel needed to keep hospitals running and for the cold chain storage of the vaccines. He said he also worried people would be “scared to move from shelters to hospitals or healthcare centres” even with the agreement of a humanitarian pause in place. About 90% of all Gazans have been displaced and with health services under huge strain, most children have seen their regular immunisations disrupted leaving them vulnerable to infection, like baby Abdulrahman Abu Judyan. A video shot a few months ago shows that he was crawling early.  But now as he turns one, his mother Niveen - who lives in a crowded tent camp in central Gaza - worries that he will never be able to walk. “It was very shocking,” Niveen tells the BBC, recalling her son’s recent diagnosis with polio, which has left him partly paralysed in one leg. “I wasn’t expecting this.  Now he may not be able to crawl or walk and the child was left without proper medical care. ”On 7 October - the day of a shocking Hamas-led attack on southern Israel which killed 1,200 people - newborn Abdulrahman was supposed to receive routine vaccinations but never did. During the war that followed, the Abu Judyan family from the very north of Gaza, have moved five times - first to Gaza City, then to different locations in the centre, to Rafah in the far south and back to Deir al-Balah. “I feel a lot of guilt that he didn’t get the vaccination. But I couldn’t give it to him because of our circumstances,” Niveen says as she rocks her baby in a car seat.  She desperately hopes that her son can be taken outside Gaza for treatment.  “He wants to live and walk like other children,” she says. The mother struggles to find clean drinking water for her nine children.  Close to the makeshift tent where they live, raw sewage flows through the street. Conditions are ideal for the spread of diseases - especially polio which is highly infectious. Since discovering the virus in wastewater samples taken in June, UN agencies have been racing to set up an emergency mass vaccination programme. More than 2,000 workers - mostly locals - are involved in the immunisation effort.  Palestinian health officials say there will be more than 400 fixed vaccination sites - which include healthcare centres, hospitals, clinics, and field hospitals – and about 230 so-called outreach sites, community gathering places, where vaccines will be distributed. Each child must receive two drops of oral polio vaccine in two rounds, the second to be administered four weeks after the first.  It is essential that the programme is carried out quickly to prevent mutation of the virus and break transmission. The polio variant that triggered this latest outbreak is itself a mutated virus from an oral polio vaccine. This is because the vaccine contains a weakened live virus which in very rare cases is shed by those who receive it and can then evolve into a new form that can start new epidemics. With doctors in Gaza on high alert for potential polio infections in children, tests are being carried out at a WHO-approved laboratory in Jordan. “There could be more cases of paralytic polio until this outbreak is stopped and this virus will paralyse more children,” Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO director of polio eradication for the eastern Mediterranean, tells me from Amman. He says the stakes are high for the whole region.  “The risk of course, is not only just for Gaza, given the high force of transmission in Gaza, there is a risk of this spilling over into Israel, into the West Bank and surrounding countries. ”For now, though the focus remains on Gaza - where children make up nearly half of the 2.3 million population. The past year has deprived many of their loved ones, their homes and health. With no end in sight to the war, the hope is that at least one new source of suffering can be eliminated.","Gaza polio vaccine rollout starts well, UN says","Gaza polio vaccine rollout starts well, UN says","palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gl62rvvp8o,articles/article_2961.txt,results/article_2961.txt.json

Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men. In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help. Ramez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry. Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith. Soon after they were silent. “I took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don’t know how we can go back to our home. . . without my mother, or father, or brothers,” says Ramez. The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago. The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies. Inside a house that is still standing, a young man kneels in front of his dead sister. She looks to be in her thirties. “Oh God, my sister, my sister,” he calls out. Civil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. They are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves. Ahmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage. Behind him, a colleague tries to give CPR to a woman. It is hopeless. ""This is the al-Sayyed family house,” Ahmed says. “There are bodies, torn parts in this area. . . It is a horrible crime. ”Several ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. Blood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley. Many of the casualties are taken to Jabalia’s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment. ""We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,” he said. The United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. Israel says it is taking American concerns seriously and is “addressing the issue"". International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. The IDF says it only targets “terror cells” and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia. The army also said they’d found weapons and boobytraps in a medical facility. In the video an officer, his face blurred, points to booby traps and weapons and speaks to the camera: “Everything here is a cynical exploitation of the civilian population, inside a clinic, inside a civilian compound. We will pursue these terrorists and find them in every corner. ”In Jabalia, a heavily pregnant woman is sitting in the dust outside a house. The Civil Defence workers arrive and help her onto a stretcher. Her father is there and tells her, “You are going to be ok. You are going to give birth, my heart. ” Then a shell explodes nearby. The small group rushes to the ambulance and escapes. Every day they plead for peace in Jabalia. For food, and medicine, for schools to open. They plead, but know their voices cannot make it stop.

Tens of thousands of people now have to live on the coastline, forced to leave their homes during the war. In recent days they have come under a new kind of assault: from winter seas battering their flimsy, makeshift dwellings. “Nothing is left in the tent: not mattresses, bedding, bread, everything was taken. The sea took it,” says Mohammed al-Halabi, in Deir al-Balah. “We rescued a two-month-old child who was dragged out to sea. ”Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now displaced and nine in ten of those living in shelters are in tents, the UN says. With temperatures plummeting, many people have been falling sick. There have been floods of rainwater and sewage. “My children’s feet, their heads—everything is freezing,” Shaima Issa tells the BBC in Khan Younis. “My daughter has a fever because of the cold. We’re essentially living on the streets, surrounded by strips of fabric.  Everyone here is sick and coughing. ”“When it rains on us, we’re drenched,” adds her neighbour, Salwa Abu Nimer, crying.  “The heavy rain floods us, and we don’t have a waterproof cover. The water seeps into the tent, we wear our clothes wet. ”“No flour, no food, no drink, no shelter,” she went on. “What is this life I’m living? I go to the ends of the earth just to feed my children. ” While the situation is worst in the north, UN officials are warning of dire shortages of medicines, food, shelter and fuel across Gaza, describing the situation as “catastrophic. ”There are long queues for charity handouts in parts of central and southern Gaza where most people are living. On successive days, our local cameramen have filmed hundreds of people crowding outside bakeries where there is very little bread.  At times, there are crushes as those waiting surge forward. “I need a loaf of bread. I have pain, diabetes, and high blood pressure. I can’t push through crowds of people; I’m afraid I’ll suffocate and die,” says Hanan al-Shamali, who is in Deir al-Balah but originally comes from northern Gaza. “I need bread so that I can feed the orphans I take care of. Every morning, I come here.  In the end, do I get bread or not? Sometimes I get it, but most of the time, I don’t. ” At the Kerem Shalom crossing, Israel’s main crossing point with Gaza, last week journalists were shown lorries moving goods that had gone through security checks. Aid entering the Palestinian territory remains at some of the lowest levels of the past year.  Israel blames aid agencies for distribution problems. “Unfortunately we're still seeing that the biggest backlog for humanitarian aid getting to where it needs to get to is the distribution capabilities of the international organisations, as the 800 trucks worth of aid around me attest to,"" said Shimon Freedman, spokesman for Cogat, part of the Israeli military that control the crossings. But inside Gaza, humanitarian workers say armed gangs have been looting incoming supplies brought through Kerem Shalom amid increased lawlessness. This has now led the biggest UN agency operating in the territory, Unrwa, to pause its use of this route for deliveries. The overall picture, says Antoine Renard, local head of the UN’s World Food Programme, is of Palestinians facing “a daily struggle for survival”. ""The levels of hunger, devastation and destruction we are seeing now in Gaza is worse than ever before. People cannot cope anymore,” Mr Renard says. “There is barely any food coming in while markets are empty. ”Amid the destruction in Gaza, there is still no end in sight to the war. Just the expectation of more suffering, as cold weather sets in.",Gazans displaced by war now face a new threat: winter,Gazans displaced by war now face a new threat: winter,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqdr0591qro,articles/article_2970.txt,results/article_2970.txt.json
2971,2024-10-26 00:04:32.966000+00:00,/news/articles/ce8151n1elno,"There is one image that keeps a Gaza musician going like no other - that of the territory’s only concert grand piano. Khamis Abu Shaban had finally risked returning to the music school at which he taught - and which owns the piano - a few months into the current conflict. What he saw, at the Gaza branch of the Palestinian music school, the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, was “a catastrophe”. “More than half of the Conservatory was burned. All the instruments were broken, thrown outside. You start seeing cases of instruments as soon as you get close to the Conservatory on the streets. Violins, we had more than 50, completely smashed. Cellos, more than 40, completely smashed. ” Altogether, the Gaza branch of the Conservatory used to have more than 400 instruments - both Western classical ones and traditional Arabic instruments such as the oud, qanun and nay, a type of flute. Khamis says he felt “completely destroyed”. But then he saw something which lifted his spirits. “The only… instrument that I saw standing was the grand piano. Honestly, I smiled when I saw it. I smiled and I laughed. ” The Yamaha concert grand also withstood bombing in a previous war between Israel and Gaza’s rulers - Hamas - in 2014, and was carefully restored the following year by a French music technician. It became a symbol for many of aspirations that the territory could develop a flourishing musical culture. “I started talking to the piano,” says Khamis. “I asked: ‘Are you the only survivor of all the instruments? You don't want to die?’ I really laughed. ” Singing in GazaTim Whewell reported from Gaza in 2015 on the rescue of the territory’s only concert grand piano after a previous war. Now, he finds out how musicians he met then are living and working through this war. He learns about a boy who started playing the violin after he lost his hand in an airstrike. And he finds out about the second near-miraculous survival of the grand piano. Listen on BBC Sounds  It is too dangerous for the teachers and students to resume lessons at the music school, because of Israeli military operations in the area around it in north-west Gaza. Instead, they have started giving music lessons to tens of thousands of displaced children living in the makeshift camps where many Gazans now reside. They teach outdoors, under canvas awnings, or in schools and shelters run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees. “Life goes on, and even with all this death around us, people need anything that can make them… not happy - no-one will be happy in this period - but something that can make them smile, be able to continue with life,” Khamis says. The teachers - who are using whatever borrowed instruments they can find - include former students of the Conservatory, such as 16-year-old violinist Sama Nijim. One of her students is Mohammed Abu Eideh, a boy who lost his right hand in an airstrike. He used to play the oud - his favourite instrument - but this requires two hands. So Sama devised a way for him to learn violin instead - by tying a violin bow to his arm with a scarf, so that he could bow without the use of a hand. Such versatility on the part of the staff can also be seen in teacher Osama Jahjouh’s fashioning of a nay - or traditional flute - out of a plastic pipe, because the Conservatory nays have been lost. Fuad Khader, who created a children’s choir in Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of Gaza, says that at first it was difficult to persuade parents to let their children take part in the activities. “They asked: ‘People are dying, and you want to teach kids to sing?’” he says. “But I just told them: ‘Everyone has to do something. I’m a musician. And this is my job. ’”Another teacher, Ahmed Abu Amsha, says the music lessons had a transformative effect on the children. “After a week, the families came to me and told me: ‘You have changed our kids. They are getting better. They are singing, they are laughing. ’” But he adds: “Sometimes we are singing a song - and suddenly there's a big explosion, that makes us go silent and look at each other. And I say: ‘Don't worry, let's continue. ’ I have to be strong in front of the children. And in some moments, they forget they are in a war. “But when they go, I'm not strong,” he says. “It’s like I’m sucking the bad energy from the kids. And when I try to go to sleep, it’s a horrible feeling… [I will be] thinking of a kid - how he's seen dead bodies in the street, and his father is dead, and his sister and his uncle… Each child has a story to tell, and I try to heal them. ”As for the grand piano, Khamis Abu Shaban hopes students will one day be able to play it again. He says that when he last saw it, several months into the war, he lifted the lid and found that some of the strings had been cut and some of the hammers broken. “I'm familiar with how an instrument can be damaged,” he said. “A hammer cannot be broken just by shock waves, for example. Someone has opened it and started sabotaging the inside. ”But Khamis' delight at having seen the piano is undiminished. “Now, I see it still standing in front of me,” he laughs. “It’s telling me: ‘I'm not one to die. I'm still here for you. And I will stay. ’”",Gaza’s only concert grand piano becomes image of hope,Gaza’s only concert grand piano becomes image of hope,"palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8151n1elno,articles/article_2971.txt,results/article_2971.txt.json
2972,2024-11-08 11:14:58.601000+00:00,/news/articles/cj4vw1l8xvdo,"The most prominent Islamic scholar in Gaza has issued a rare, powerful fatwa condemning Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the devastating war in the Palestinian territory. Professor Dr Salman al-Dayah, a former dean of the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the Hamas-affiliated Islamic University of Gaza, is one of the region’s most respected religious authorities, so his legal opinion carries significant weight among Gaza’s two million population, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim. A fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal ruling from a respected religious scholar usually based on the Quran or the Sunnah - the sayings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad. Dr Dayah’s fatwa, which was published in a detailed six-page document, criticises Hamas for what he calls “violating Islamic principles governing jihad”. Jihad means “struggle” in Arabic and in Islam it can be a personal struggle for spiritual improvement or a military struggle against unbelievers. Dr Dayah adds: “If the pillars, causes, or conditions of jihad are not met, it must be avoided in order to avoid destroying people’s lives. This is something that is easy to guess for our country’s politicians, so the attack must have been avoided. ”For Hamas, the fatwa represents an embarrassing and potentially damaging critique, particularly as the group often justifies its attacks on Israel through religious arguments to garner support from Arab and Muslim communities. The 7 October attack saw hundreds of Hamas gunmen from Gaza invade southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explainedWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? Dr Dayah argues that the significant civilian casualties in Gaza, together with the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian disaster that have followed the 7 October attack, means that it was in direct contradiction to the teachings of Islam. Hamas, he says, has failed in its obligations of “keeping fighters away from the homes of defenceless [Palestinian] civilians and their shelters, and providing security and safety as much as possible in the various aspects of life. . . security, economic, health, and education, and saving enough supplies for them. ”Dr Dayah points to Quranic verses and the Sunnah that set strict conditions for the conduct of jihad, including the necessity of avoiding actions that provoke an excessive and disproportionate response by an opponent. His fatwa highlights that, according to Islamic law, a military raid should not trigger a response that exceeds the intended benefits of the action. He also stresses that Muslim leaders are obligated to ensure the safety and well-being of non-combatants, including by providing food, medicine, and refuge to those not involved in the fighting. “Human life is more precious to God than Mecca,” Dr Dayah states. His opposition to the 7 October attack is especially significant given his deep influence in Gaza, where he is seen as a key religious figure and a vocal critic of Islamist movements, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. His moderate Salafist beliefs place him in direct opposition to Hamas’s approach to armed resistance and its ties to Shia-ruled Iran. Salafists are fundamentalists who seek to adhere the example of the Prophet Muhammad and the first generations who followed him. Dr Dayah has consistently argued for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate that adheres strictly to Islamic law, rather than the political party-based systems that Hamas and other groups advocate. “Our role model is the Prophet Muhammad, who founded a nation and did not establish political parties that divide the nation. Therefore, parties in Islam are forbidden,” he said in a sermon he gave at a mosque several years ago. He has also condemned extremism, opposing jihadist groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and has used all of his platforms to issue fatwas on various social and political issues, ranging from commercial transactions, social disputes over marriage and divorce, to the conduct of political violence. The fatwa adds to the growing internal debate within Gaza and the broader Arab world over the moral and legal implications of Hamas’s actions, and it is likely to fuel further divisions within Palestinian society regarding the use of armed resistance in the ongoing conflict with Israel. Sheikh Ashraf Ahmed, one of Dr Dayah’s students who was forced to leave his house in Gaza City last year and flee to the south of Gaza with his wife and nine children, told the BBC: “Our scholar [Dr Dayah] refused to leave his home in northern Gaza despite the fears of Israeli air strikes. He chose to fulfil his religious duty by issuing his legal opinion on the attack”. Ahmed described the fatwa as the most powerful legal judgment of a historical moment. “It’s a deeply well researched document, reflecting Dayah’s commitment to Islamic jurisprudence,” he said.",Gaza’s top Islamic scholar issues fatwa criticising 7 October attack,Gaza’s top Islamic scholar issues fatwa criticising 7 October attack,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4vw1l8xvdo,articles/article_2972.txt,results/article_2972.txt.json
2973,2024-09-04 18:58:30.870000+00:00,/news/articles/cpdl3veg1l4o,"A funeral has been held for a 16-year-old Palestinian girl reportedly killed by Israeli forces in the north of the occupied West Bank on the seventh day of a wide-scale Israeli operation. Lujain Musleh’s father said she was shot in the head as she looked out of a window of her home in Kafr Dan, just outside Jenin, after soldiers surrounded a neighbouring house on Tuesday. The Israeli military said armed fighters fired at the soldiers and that they “fired back at a suspect who observed” them. The Palestinian health ministry says 30 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched what it called an operation to dismantle ""terrorist cells"". Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as members, but several children are also among them, according to the ministry. The Israeli military has said that one Israeli soldier has been killed. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Defence for Children Palestine (DCIP), a rights group, said, external Israeli soldiers entered Kafr Dan around 11:30 (09:30 BST) on Tuesday, prompting clashes with armed Palestinians. “Israeli soldiers surrounded and besieged the home of a wanted Palestinian man, firing live ammunition and shells at the house,” it said. “Around 14:10, 16-year-old Loujain was inside her family’s home . . . when an Israeli sniper shot her in the head through a window. ”During a funeral procession for Loujain on Wednesday, her father, Osama, told reporters: ""She didn't go to the roof, she didn't hurl a stone, and she wasn't carrying a weapon. "" ""The only thing she did is look from the window and the soldier saw her and shot her. ""The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers surrounded two civilian structures in Kafr Dan where they believed armed fighters were sheltering, and that they “called for civilians to evacuate from both structures prior to the exchange of fire that took place”. “During the encircling of the structures, the terrorists opened fire at IDF soldiers in the area, and in response the soldiers fired back at a suspect who observed the forces in the area, in order to remove a threat,” it added. “The IDF is aware of the report regarding a 16-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed during the exchange of fire. The details of the incident are under review. ”Pictures from the funeral showed mourners carrying a body wrapped in a Hamas flag. The bodies of those killed by Israel are often wrapped in the flags of movements supported by friends or family members - even when the deceased are not supporters themselves.  DCIP also cited documentation it had collected which said a 14-year-old boy, Mohammed Kanaan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper on Tuesday morning at an entrance to the Tulkarm refugee camp, in Tulkarm city. The IDF said it was looking into that report. When asked by the BBC on Tuesday to comment on the reports of civilian deaths, the IDF said its forces operated in strict accordance with international law. “The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target civilians,” it added. “Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians. ”The IDF said its soldiers had killed two armed fighters during an exchange of fire in Tulkarm on Tuesday, and also located an explosive device in a baby stroller. On Monday evening, it announced that 14 “terrorists” had been killed in Jenin since the start of the operation and that 25 suspects had been detained. ""Every terrorist must be eliminated, and if they surrender, they must be arrested. There is no other option, use all the forces, everyone who is needed, with full strength,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told IDF officers on Wednesday. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa said on Tuesday that the losses caused by the raids, especially of infrastructure, might be the most extensive in two decades. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees expressed particular concern about Jenin, saying it had been “ravaged by violence and destruction”. Jenin’s streets have been so damaged that cars cannot pass some roads. Israeli bulldozers have destroyed many shops in the city centre, although those on the periphery were still open. The local municipality said the IDF had bulldozed more than 70% of streets, cut off water to 80% of the city, and damaged 20km (12 miles) of water, sewage, communications and electricity networks. The IDF said: “The terrorists in [the West Bank] exploit the civilian population and use them as human shields for murderous purposes, establishing terrorist infrastructures and planting explosives underneath traffic routes to harm the IDF troops in their attempts to thwart threats to the lives of Israeli citizens. ”It also said it would work quickly to enable local authorities to repair damaged infrastructure and ensure the functionality of essential services. Israeli forces have also surrounded Jenin’s government hospital throughout the operation. Hospital director Dr Wisam Baker told the BBC on Monday that no-one could come in and out, including doctors like him travelling home, except in ambulances. Troops searched the vehicles and checked the IDs of those inside, he added. Ambulance drivers are “afraid” to bring wounded to the hospital or are delayed from entering because of searches, he said, adding the delay could put lives at risk. The hospital has been running on a generator, and 10 tanks of water are brought in each day, Dr Baker said. Ambulances have also been delivering food. Asked about the presence of troops outside the hospital, the IDF alleged that armed groups were exploiting medical and other facilities that were protected under international law. “The hospitals continue to operate as usual. In appropriate cases, inspections are conducted on those arriving at the hospital, provided that this does not prevent their treatment or endanger their health,” it said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its teams were “tirelessly providing humanitarian and emergency services to the besieged citizens in the Jenin camp, despite continuous obstructions by Israeli occupation forces, who are hindering [their] work. ”On Monday, it said many Jenin residents were in urgent need of medicine, baby formula or food supplies, and that two paramedics and a volunteer doctor had been injured while on duty.",Girl 'killed inside home' as Israeli West Bank operation continues,Girl 'killed inside home' as Israeli West Bank operation continues,"israel,palestinian_territories",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdl3veg1l4o,articles/article_2973.txt,results/article_2973.txt.json

Her sister Rahma is fair-haired and has blue eyes. There is a 13-year age difference between them. But to Malak - who lost her father in an Israeli attack - the four-month-old baby is an unimaginably precious gift. “I love her so much, in a way no-one else knows,” she says. The BBC went back to meet Malak and others in Gaza as the first anniversary of the war approached. We first interviewed Malak in February, just after the death of her father, Abed-Alrahman al-Najjar, a 32-year-old farm labourer. The father of seven, believed to have been hit by shrapnel, was among more than 70 people killed during an Israeli commando operation to rescue two hostages held by Hamas in Rafah. He was asleep with his family in a refugee tent when the raid happened. Their tent was close to the scene of the fighting. Malak lost an eye in the attack. She also suffered a wound in her side. Back then she was severely traumatised - when she met a BBC colleague, she called out in anguish, “I am in pain. I lost my dad. Enough!”Since then, doctors have fitted a small white sphere in her empty eye socket. It will have to suffice until the war ends and she hopefully can be fitted with a proper prosthetic eye. But Malak does not complain about this loss - rather, she imagines how her father would react if he could hold baby Rahma, born three months after his death. She smiles and says: “He always wanted to have a daughter with blue eyes. ”After what has happened, Malak wants to train as an eye doctor, to help others who suffer as she does. She is sitting on a concrete floor in Khan Younis in southern Gaza with the baby and her five other younger siblings - three sisters, two brothers, aged between four and 12 years old. Before the war, their father worked hard on other people’s farms to support his family. “Our father used to take us out and buy us clothes in the winter. He was so kind to us. He would deny himself but never us,” Malak remembers. Then came 7 October 2023, and the Hamas assault on Israel in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed - among them, dozens of children. More than 250 hostages were abducted into Gaza. There were 30 children seized, including a baby of nine months. The attack triggered Israel’s ground invasion, relentless air strikes and fighting with Hamas. Almost 42,000 people have now been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. About 90% of Gaza’s population - nearly two million people - are displaced, according to the United Nations. Malak’s family has been uprooted four times. “I carry a pain that even mountains cannot bear,” she says. “We were displaced, and it feels like our whole life is displacement. We move from place to place. ” Follow live updates on this storyAnalysis: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider warAnalysis: What will it take to end the conflict?Gaza then and now - a visual guide to how life has changed in 12 monthsThese are the hostages still held by Hamas The Israeli government refuses to allow foreign reporters into Gaza, and the BBC relies on a team of local journalists to cover the humanitarian crisis. We briefed them with questions and asked them to contact some of the Palestinians we have spoken to in Gaza over the past 12 months. These journalists share the fear and displacement of the people they report on. Displacement means uncertainty. Constant fear. Will the child, sent for a bucket of water, come home? Or will they return to find their home flattened, and their family buried under the rubble? These are the questions that haunt Abed-Alrahman’s young widow, Nawara, every day. “There is always shelling and we are always afraid, terrified. I constantly hold my children close and hug them,” she says. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tell people to move to so-called “humanitarian zones”. People flee but often find no safety. When they move, the struggle to locate food, firewood and medicine in an unfamiliar place starts again. The al-Najjars are now back in their family home, but they know they may have to flee again. That is the inescapable reality of their lives after a year of war. In the words of Nawara, there is “no safe place in the Gaza Strip”. Nawara complains of the overflowing sewage in the street. The lack of medical supplies. Like so many in Gaza, with no income, she depends on what food her in-laws or charities can supply. There are no schools open for her children, who are among the 465,000 that Unicef - the UN Children’s Fund - estimate are affected by school closures there. “Our health - my children’s and mine - is bad. They are always sick, always have fevers or diarrhoea. They are always feeling unwell,” Nawara adds. Through all of this, she holds on to the memory of her husband Abed-Alrahman. “I look at his picture, and keep talking to him. I imagine he’s still alive,” she says. “I keep talking to him on the phone as if he’s replying to me, and I imagine answering back. Every day I sit by myself, bring up his name, talk to him, and cry. I feel like he’s aware of everything I’m going through. ”And Malak too has her daily ritual. She and one of her sisters try to do a charitable deed each day in memory of their father. When possible, their aunt makes a gift of food for the dead man. “At night, we put it out and pray for him,” Malak says. The stories of Nawara al-Najjar and Malak are a fragmentary glimpse into the suffering of the last 12 months. As the war enters its second year, our BBC colleagues on the ground continue to report on death and displacement. In northern Gaza we re-visited the family of a disabled man who died after being attacked in an Israeli search operation. ___ Muhammed Bhar was terrified. The dog growled and lunged. It was biting, drawing blood and he could not stop it. Around him, the sitting room was full of noise - his mother and little niece screaming, the Israeli soldiers shouting orders. Muhammed, aged 24, had Down's syndrome and was autistic - he could not have understood what was happening. When a BBC colleague first spoke to his family in July, they were still struggling with the shock of what had happened. Muhammed’s mother, Nabila, 70, described what she remembered: “I constantly see the dog tearing at him and his hand, and the blood pouring from his hand. “This scene I will never forget - it stays in front of my eyes the whole time, it never leaves me at all. We couldn't save him, neither from them, nor from the dog. ” The incident happened on 3 July, as troops were engaged in intense close-quarter combat in Shejaiya. The IDF said that there were “significant exchanges of fire between [its troops] and Hamas terrorists”. According to the IDF, troops were searching buildings for Hamas using a dog - these animals are regularly used to hunt for fighters, booby traps, explosives and weapons. “Inside one of the buildings,” the IDF said, “the canine detected terrorists and bit an individual. ” The soldiers restrained the animal and gave Muhammed some “initial medical treatment” in another room. Nabila Bhar said a military doctor arrived and went into the room where Muhammed was lying. His niece, Janna Bhar, 11, remembered troops saying he was “fine”. Two of Muhammed’s brothers were arrested during the raid, according to the family. They say one has since been released. Nabila said the rest of the family was ordered to leave. They pleaded to be allowed to stay with the wounded Muhammed. The IDF said they were “urged to leave to avoid staying in the combat area”. Some time after this - the army has not said how long - the troops left. The IDF said they went to help soldiers who had been ambushed. The army report for 3 July named Capt Roy Miller, 21, as having been killed, and three other soldiers wounded, during fighting in Shejaiya. Muhammed was now alone. The IDF statement did not say what condition he was in when the soldiers left. His brother Jibreel believes he had not been given proper treatment. “They could have treated him much better than they did, but they just put some gauze on him, as if they did a quick, careless job. Whether he lived or died didn’t seem to matter to them,” he says. The Israelis withdrew from the neighbourhood a week later and Muhammed’s family returned. They found him dead on the kitchen floor. It is still not known what exactly caused his death after he was attacked by the dog. In the current wartime circumstances the family has not been able to have an autopsy carried out. The young man was buried in an alleyway beside the house because it was too dangerous to go to the cemetery where his father - who died before the war - was interred. Three months later, Muhammed is still interred in the alleyway. His brother Jibreel has covered the grave with plastic sheeting, some concrete blocks and a sheet of corrugated iron. It is surrounded by a mess of rubble and pieces of metal, the detritus from bombed-out buildings nearby. Inside, Muhammed’s bedroom has been left shuttered. Jibreel opens the door, walks into the darkness, opens a wardrobe and takes out some of his brother’s clothes. Along with some photographs and family videos, they are the remaining mementoes of his life in the house. “His personal room was where he exercised, played, and ate, and no-one entered this room except for him,” he says. In the sitting room, Jibreel points to the couch where Muhammed was sitting when the dog attacked. The blood stains have dried into the fabric. “Every corner of this house reminds us of Muhammad,” Jibreel says. “This is the spot where he would always sit. We would sit around him, making sure not to disturb him. He loved peace and quiet. ”The family wants an independent investigation into his death. “Once the war ends and international human rights organisations and legal groups return,” says Jibreel, “we will definitely file a legal case against the Israeli army. “Muhammad was a special case - he wasn’t a fighter, he wasn’t armed, just an ordinary civilian. He wasn’t even just any civilian, he had special needs. ”___ Most of Dr Amjad Elawa’s neighbours and friends have gone. They are either dead or have fled south, hoping it will be safer there. When he walks home from the hospital, he sees people on the streets talking to themselves. “No one is in their right mind anymore,” he says. Dr Elawa, 32, works in the Emergency Services department of al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. Back at the start of the war it was the largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip. Now, much of the hospital is in ruins following two major raids by the IDF, who said Hamas and other gunmen used the facility to plan and launch attacks in breach of international law. The charge is rejected by Gaza's health ministry, which accuses Israel of committing war crimes at al-Shifa. Dr Elawa has seen children die in front of him. Victims of war wounds. Of disease, often caused by the lack of clean water. And when the BBC first met him, the area was facing acute malnutrition. In February - when the BBC first interviewed Dr Elawa - he described witnessing the death of two-month-old Mahmoud Fatou. The baby boy died soon after being brought to the hospital. ""This child could not be provided with milk. His mum was not provided with food to be able to breastfeed him,"" said Dr Elawa. ""He had symptoms of severe dehydration, and he was taking his last breaths when he came. ""Dr Elawa’s own son was born 12 days after the 7 October attacks. After the death of Mahmoud Fatou, he reflected on his own family situation. “We were all shocked - this child could be our child. Maybe my son after a few days will be just like him,” he said. Thankfully, Dr Elawa’s son is healthy and about to celebrate his first birthday. The doctor faces the same problems as almost everybody else in northern Gaza. His house was destroyed and he had to move with his family to a patient’s home. The UN and humanitarian NGOs in Gaza say Israel has regularly blocked aid from entering. For example, in the first two weeks of January (the month before we met Dr Elawa), the UN said 69% of requests to move aid and 95% of missions to provide fuel and medicines to water reservoirs, water wells and health facilities in northern Gaza, were refused. Israel denies blocking aid. Dr Elawa queued for food whenever he could get any free time. This led to him being wounded when Israeli forces opened fire at Nabulsi roundabout in northern Gaza on 29 February. Thousands of people had gathered, hoping to be given flour from an aid convoy escorted by the IDF. More than 100 people were killed and over 700 wounded according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The IDF said most of the casualties were caused by a stampede as people rushed the trucks. The army said there were two incidents at the roundabout. It fired warning shots and then shot at individuals who the troops believed were a threat. Numerous survivors challenge that account, and say the stampede was caused by the army firing into the crowd. Dr Elawa treated his own wound and then went to help survivors. Within days he was back on duty at al-Shifa. A BBC colleague returned recently to find Dr Elawa still working in the emergency section. He returns to the theme of the wounded children he treats. “They are the only ones who really stir our emotions, especially when their limbs are lost. It’s a truly emotional and heartbreaking situation. We see children who haven’t experienced much of life yet, losing their legs. ” On a break, he goes outside and points to the ruins of different buildings. “It used to have an intensive care unit, an operating room, and a cardiology department,” he says. “Whether it’s medical devices, equipment, or anything else, all are completely destroyed, even the beds. We need a fully equipped hospital, built from scratch. ”When Dr Elawa returned after the second Israeli raid there was an overpowering stench of death from several mass graves. One of the hospital directors, Mohamed Mughir, says there were “signs of field executions, binding marks, gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs” of some of the corpses. The IDF deny allegations of war crimes and say the graves contain bodies exhumed and then re-buried by the army when searching for dead Israeli hostages. ""The claim that the IDF buried Palestinian bodies is baseless and unfounded,"" it says. The UN Human Rights Director, Volker Turk, says that, given what he calls “the prevailing climate of impunity”, there should be an independent international investigation. There is more food now. Dr Elawa has a supply of flour but says there are no vegetables, fruit or meat. They use canned foods instead. Like so many who work to save lives in Gaza, Dr Elawa prays for the war to end. “We want to return to our old lives, to be able to sleep safely, to walk in the streets safely, to visit our loved ones and relatives - those who are still alive. ” Additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard.",Girl who lost eye in Israeli raid that killed father carries ‘pain mountains can't bear’,Girl who lost eye in Israeli raid that killed father carries ‘pain mountains can't bear’,"israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr54z4q11qvo,articles/article_2974.txt,results/article_2974.txt.json
2975,2024-10-06 15:37:15.515000+00:00,/news/articles/cwyenxxz7k1o,"A vigil to remember the victims of Hamas attacks on Israel has been held in Glasgow ahead of the one-year anniversary of the latest Middle East conflict. Hundreds gathered at the steps of Kelvingrove Art Gallery to remember the victims of the 7 October attacks and to demand the immediate release of the hostages. A number of events have been held across the country this weekend to mark the anniversary of the current conflict breaking out. Thousands attended pro-Palestinian rallies in Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen on Saturday, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and to highlight the human cost of Israel's response to the attacks. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed at least 41,825 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Violence has spread to Lebanon in recent weeks. Members of Scotland's Jewish community, including speakers from the Glasgow Friends of Israel group attended the event. The sister of Bernard Cowan, who was killed by Hamas gunmen in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack was also at the vigil. Attendees waved banners with the faces of some of the hostages on them and held red heart-shaped balloons. They sang songs including 'Bring them home' from Les Misérables. One of the vigil’s organiser’s Sammy Stein told BBC Scotland News the event was “crucial” to highlight that there are ""two sides to every story"". He said: “When the event happened a year ago the news was all about the terrible atrocities that happened in Israel, then after about a week people started forgetting about what happened on 7 October. "" Mr Stein continued: “Through the last year the hostages have completely been forgotten and it’s so important to make sure that people remember that they are still in captivity and many of them are already not alive. ""What we are doing here is a vigil. It’s respectful, it's quiet and it's for remembrance. ""The event we are having today is not just for the Jewish community. There are people here today from all walks of life, all religions and it just shows that in Glasgow there is a huge amount of support. "" Phyllis Segal from Glasgow also attended the vigil. She told BBC Scotland News: ""I find it heart-breaking that we are a year down the road and we don’t seem to be any further forward. ""When I see all these young women, young men and children it’s actually beggar's belief that they’ve been hidden in tunnels for a whole year. ""I get very upset about it all. Somebody said ‘do you have family in Israel’ and we say ‘yes, millions of people’ because we are all brothers and sisters. "" Ahead of the first anniversary on Monday, the first minister has renewed calls for a ceasefire. John Swinney said: “The strength of world leaders must be focused on an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East – and we know at the heart of this situation is the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “A lasting ceasefire in Gaza, that sees the secure release of all hostages and a two-state solution, that includes the full international recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, is critical to ending conflict across the region and is the foundation upon which long term peace in the Middle East can be achieved. ""We must also see the end to all arms sales that continue to cause civilian deaths.

2976,2024-07-28 15:55:07.891000+00:00,/news/articles/clwy598dyezo,"The scene around the football pitch here in Majdal Shams, where 12 children and young people died on Saturday, is quiet and deeply sombre. There are plenty of people here - local Druze elders in their distinctive red and white turbans and baggy trousers, military officials, visiting government ministers and of course many journalists. But conversations around the crater where the rocket landed are hushed, respectful. A black flag flies at the spot where the rocket landed last night, gouging a shallow crater in the pitch and blowing out the metal fence around it. There are shrapnel holes everywhere. Wreaths have just been laid. Many people are simply standing by the crater, taking in the scene, lost in thought. In the corner of the pitch, someone has tried to remove the bloodstains on the astroturf, but with only limited success. Outside the fence, bicycles and scooters lie scattered, all blackened from yesterday’s brief but devastating fireball. There’s a bomb shelter metres away, but when the siren sounded last night, the children had mere seconds to respond. They had absolutely no chance. Israel says the rocket was fired from Shebaa, a small village just a short distance away across the western flank of Mt Hermon, which towers over Majdal Shams. Hezbollah disputes Israel’s claim, but around the time the rocket landed here, its media outlets announced that it had fired rockets towards an Israeli military base less than two miles from the football pitch. This is a day of funerals for those who died here, most of them boys and girls between 10 and 16. Grief hangs heavy in the summer heat. A voice is briefly raised, furious and urgent. “How come there’s still a Beirut?” he cries. “We’ve had 10 months of our children living in fear. ”There’s a ripple of applause, but opinion here in this Druze minority town is divided on how forcefully Israel should respond. After almost 10 months of simmering conflict, the prospect of an all-out war scares many. When Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hardline finance minister, arrives, the crowd swells and the sense of anger mounts. He’s accosted by angry locals. Some are demanding a decisive response against Hezbollah. Some accuse the government of abandoning the Golan Heights. Mr Smotrich tries to offer his condolences, even to hug those around him. But it seems not everyone is interested in his sympathy. In the middle of a large adjacent football pitch, 12 empty black chairs commemorate the lost. Fighting back the tears, 26-year-old Ugarit Abu Assad, from nearby Buqata, says she fears a major escalation. “I’m afraid of the consequences of all out war,” she says. “A lot of people are going to die. ”Walking around the steep streets of this mountain community, the sense of collective shock and mourning is overwhelming. Small groups of men, women and children, all dressed in black, are moving around silently, from one grieving household to another. Sometimes you catch sight of people hugging or wiping away each other’s tears. Wahim, a teacher who knew many of the young victims, was utterly distraught, unsure whether to try to express his feelings or stay silent. “This is a disaster. How do I even start,” he said, before apologising and dissolving into sobs. Ivan Ebrahim pulled up a picture of his 10-year-old cousin, Milar Shaar, the youngest victim. A boy who loved football and gaming. “He is the greatest kid here. Everybody loved him,” Ivan said. “I don’t know. It’s hard to describe. ”“We haven’t slept since yesterday,” Milar’s uncle, Nassar Ebrahim tells me. “The whole town is in mourning. ” The people of Majdal Shams are used to the sound of rockets overhead, but Saturday’s attack took them all by surprise. “I don’t think the government needs to respond,” Nassar says. “They need to end the war, so no-one dies on either side. ”The mood up here, away from the occasional angry outbursts down at the football pitch, is extremely subdued. But this is a part of the world where hospitality runs deep. A group of young men call us over, offering water thimbles of strong coffee. They’re determined to stay put, despite the danger. “We Druze don’t leave our homes,” one tells me, echoing a quiet defiance we encounter elsewhere. When it comes to what happens next, they’re unanimous: they don’t want a wider war. “The children here, the children in Lebanon, the children in Gaza. They don’t need more war,” another says.",Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning',Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clwy598dyezo,articles/article_2976.txt,results/article_2976.txt.json
2977,2024-09-03 05:23:53.749000+00:00,/news/articles/c8jlv28n2kvo,"It felt like quite a moment. The new-ish government spelling out a different approach to Israel and the conflict in the Middle East from that of its predecessor – the third such time it has done so in two months. When David Lammy became foreign secretary in early July, he requested an assessment of whether the evidence suggested Israel’s approach to the war could be in breach of international law. The assessment, I understand, was similar to those requested by the previous government and conducted by the same group of officials. But officials advise and ministers decide – and ministers now have come to a different conclusion than their predecessors. Here is how the process works. Laws passed when Labour was last in government set out the controls that must be in place when goods are exported for military use or potential military use. They are the Export Control Act 2002 and the Export Control Order 2008. Live: UK suspension of some arms exports sends 'wrong message', says Israeli ministerAs Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds set out: “Following a rigorous process in line with the UK’s legal obligations, the UK Government has concluded that there is a clear risk that military exports to Israel, where used for military operations in Gaza, might be used in serious violations of international humanitarian law. ”You can read Mr Reynolds’ full written statement here, external. And here is the government’s summary, external of its own arguments. It is worth keeping a sense of proportion on all this. Of roughly 350 arms exports to Israel, about 30 are being suspended – so less than 10%. And the UK is not a particularly significant arms exporter to Israel anyway. But messages and signals matter in politics – internationally and domestically. The Israeli government, which was told privately in advance before the public announcement, has expressed its disappointment. Shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell – himself the deputy foreign secretary in the last Conservative government until earlier this summer – wasn’t initially critical, but later was, saying the move, external had “all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour’s backbenches, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East. I fear it will fail on both counts”. Senior government figures insist they are legally obliged to suspend these export licences given the conclusion they have come to. But they are trying to ameliorate their actions with their words, insisting too that the decision is a matter of “deep regret. ” And they say this decision was taken on its own merits, as were the other two relating to the conflict that I mentioned a moment ago. They were the resumption of funding for UNRWA, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees. And the dropping of plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There is subtlety and nuance in each of these decisions, but they do collectively add up to a more Israel-sceptic posture than the last Conservative government adopted. For much of the last year, since the Hamas atrocities in Israel, Labour has felt political pressure from those who claim it has been too unthinkingly supportive of Israel. And in seats with a substantial Muslim population, the conflict and Labour’s approach to it often proved to be a big issue for voters at the general election, many of whom point to the death toll in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Yes, that sense of proportion and scale is worth bearing in mind. But so too the message and the signal being sent – about the different choices a new government is taking.",Government sets out more Israel-sceptic posture,Government sets out more Israel-sceptic posture,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jlv28n2kvo,articles/article_2977.txt,results/article_2977.txt.json
2978,2024-11-14 13:49:44.469000+00:00,/news/articles/ce8ygyem84jo,"Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by deliberately causing the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) says. About 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza’s population - have fled their homes over the past year, and 79% of the territory is under Israeli-issued evacuation orders, according to the UN. HRW’s report says this amounts to “forcible transfer” and that “evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy”. It also says Israeli actions appear to “meet the definition of ethnic cleansing”. Israel said the report was ""completely false and detached from reality"". ""Contrary to claims in HRW's report, Israel's efforts are directed solely at dismantling Hamas's terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza,"" Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson of Israel's ministry of foreign affairs posted on X. He added that Israel would ""continue to operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict"". HRW has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating inside homes and civilian infrastructure. The report was published as Israeli forces continued a ground offensive in northern Gaza that has displaced up to 130,000 people over the past five weeks. The UN has said 75,000 people remain under siege with dwindling supplies of water and food in the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, where the Israeli military says it is preventing a Hamas resurgence. Under the laws of war, the forced displacement of any civilians inside an occupied territory is prohibited, unless it is necessary for their security or for an imperative military reason. For displacement to be lawful, civilians must be moved safely and provided with accommodation and essential supplies. They must also be able to return to their homes after the end of hostilities in the area. HRW’s report - based on interviews with displaced Palestinians, analysis of Israeli evacuation orders, satellite imagery showing destruction of buildings, and videos and photos of strikes - concludes that there is no plausible imperative military reason to justify the displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s population and that the other conditions for it be lawful have also not been met. The US-based group says the Israeli evacuation orders have been “inconsistent, inaccurate, and frequently not communicated to civilians with enough time”, and that they “did not consider the needs of people with disabilities and others who are unable to leave”. Israeli forces have also “repeatedly struck designated evacuation routes and safe zones”, it adds. It accuses Israeli authorities of blocking “all but a small fraction of the necessary humanitarian aid, water, electricity, and fuel from reaching civilians in need”, as well as carrying out attacks that have damaged and destroyed vital resources like hospitals and bakeries. HRW also alleges that Israel’s military has “intentionally demolished or severely damaged civilian infrastructure, including controlled demolitions of homes, with the apparent aim of creating an extended ‘buffer zone’ along Gaza’s perimeter with Israel and a corridor which will bifurcate Gaza”. “The destruction is so substantial that it indicates the intention to permanently displace many people,” it warns. Israeli government ministers are also cited as saying that Gaza’s territory would decrease and that land would be handed to Israeli settlers. “Forced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity,” HRW says. It also says that the “organised, violent displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, who are members of another ethnic group, is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors”, and that such actions “amount to ethnic cleansing”. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the report was “both selectively presents information in a manner that obscures context, as well as makes certain blatant misrepresentations"". “The IDF’s warnings to members of the civilian population to temporarily distance themselves from areas expected to be exposed to intense warfare are made in accordance with the obligation under international law to take feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm by providing advance warnings prior to attacks,” it added. “The IDF only operates in areas in which there is known to be a military presence, and is still at this time working to dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure in various parts throughout the Gaza Strip. ”The IDF has also previously denied that it is seeking to create permanent buffer zones and Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar recently said that displaced people from northern Gaza would be allowed to return home at the end of the war. Also on Thursday, a UN General Assembly special committee released a new report that says Israel’s warfare methods in Gaza are “consistent with the characteristics of genocide, with mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians there”. Israel has vehemently denied that its forces are committing genocide in Gaza. During a press briefing on Thursday, US state department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters the US ""unequivocally disagreed"" that Israeli warfare methods were consistent with genocide. ""We think that that kind of phrasing and those kind of accusations are certainly unfounded,"" he said. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",HRW accuses Israel of war crime of forced displacement in Gaza,HRW accuses Israel of war crime of forced displacement in Gaza,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8ygyem84jo,articles/article_2978.txt,results/article_2978.txt.json
2979,2024-07-31 13:38:20.521000+00:00,/news/articles/ce98regp6y1o,"The leadership of the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been left in ""a state of shock"" by the assassination of its political leader Ismail Haniyeh, top officials have told the BBC. Hamas says Haniyeh, 62, was killed in an Israeli strike early on Wednesday morning in Iran. Widely considered the group's overall leader, he has been a prominent member since the late 1980s. As head of its political bureau based in Qatar, Haniyeh led Hamas' outreach to regional governments and was central to its alliance with Tehran and its proxy groups across the Middle East. He has been wanted by Israeli officials for months and the BBC understands that his protection team had recently vetoed a proposed trip to Lebanon amid security fears. But he played little role in Hamas' military operations and as such may have felt free to operate more openly than some of his colleagues - reflected by three trips he has taken to Iran since the 7 October attacks in Israel. Live updates on this storyWhat does Haniyeh's killing mean for Gaza ceasefire?Questions over Haniyeh's succession were already coming into view before his death. Hamas' constitution prevents any political bureau chief serving more than two terms. A new candidate was set to be chosen in 2025. But his death could now expedite an internal battle between competing wings of the movement. Haniyeh himself was widely viewed by Arab diplomats as a pragmatic figure compared to others at the top of Hamas - driving the group’s political outreach to regional governments as opposed to the militant options favoured by Mohammed Deif and other leaders. Deif leads the military wing of Hamas. Earlier this month Israel said it had targeted Deif in deadly air strikes on Gaza but there has been no confirmation he was killed. One Hamas official told the BBC: “Hamas is an idea, Hamas is an ideology. And the killing of the leader will not change Hamas, and will not make Hamas surrender or make any more concessions. "" It suggests an attempt by some leaders to dismiss the idea of any tension within the movement. But in truth, the looming succession process could be lengthy and chaotic - defined by rivalries between those keen to reach a negotiated settlement to the war and extremist elements more closely allied with Iran. CIA Director Bill Burns said recently that tensions have emerged among some senior Hamas commanders who have been urging the group's leadership to show more flexibility in negotiations and to accept a hostage-ceasefire deal. However, anger over the death of Haniyeh - and the January assassination of his deputy Saleh al-Arouri - likely puts the hardliners in pole position. In summer 2023, one Hamas official identified Yahya Sinwar and al-Arouri as the two leading candidates to replace Haniyeh. On Wednesday, Hamas officials told the BBC that there were now three likely candidates to put their names forward in the coming days. The most likely contender is Sinwar. He is the group's head in the Gaza Strip and is believed to be the mastermind behind the 7 October attacks in Israel that killed 1,200 people and sparked the ongoing conflict. Sinwar is the key decision maker on how Hamas prosecutes the ongoing conflict and is said to be in hiding in Hamas' tunnel network beneath Gaza.  Khaled Meshaal is another possible candidate. He is widely seen a less militant candidate than Sinwar and has previously served as chief of the political bureau. However, he has difficult relations with Iran - now the key ally and supplier of Hamas' military wing. During the height of the Syrian civil war, Meshaal - then living in Damascus - refused to support the Iranian-backed President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. The failure forced Hamas to relocate their political bureau to Qatar. The final potential candidate is Zaher Jabareen, who is responsible for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. He could play a key role in ongoing negotiations on prisoner swaps with Israel. Who are the most prominent leaders in Hamas?Either way, the contest is almost certain to be drawn out. Under normal circumstances, Hamas' political bureau is chosen by the Shura Council, whose members are elected by local council groups. The body then elects the 15-person political bureau, who choose a leader. But members of the political bureau are scattered across the Middle East with representatives living in exile in Turkey and Qatar, making it difficult to assemble them at short notice. Many are also on Israeli wanted lists - which may make some reluctant to travel. Other questions continue to swirl over Hamas' response to Haniyeh's death. In 2012, the death of the deputy lead of Hamas' military wing, Ahmed al-Jaabari, saw Hamas respond with missile fire. So how Hamas responds to Haniyeh's death could indicate how much damage has been done to its military infrastructure after 10 months of war. One Palestinian official also observed that his death could have a profound impact on the ongoing peace negotiations with Israel. Haniyeh, as the acceptable face of Hamas to some in the region, was viewed as the most likely person to be able to broker a deal due to his good relations with regional diplomats.

A statement from the armed group said it had been a “martyrdom operation"" carried out in co-operation with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It also warned that suicide attacks would “return to the forefront” if Israel continued what it called “massacres” of Palestinians. Israel’s police force and Shin Bet domestic security service said earlier that they could confirm it was a terrorist attack involving a powerful explosive device. The blast happened on Lehi Street in southern Tel Aviv, about an hour after the US secretary of state landed in the city to push for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. CCTV footage filmed moments before appeared to show a middle aged man walking past a shop carrying a full backpack, external. Israel’s Magen David Adom service said paramedics found an unconscious man in his 50s with multiple systemic injuries who they pronounced dead at the scene. A 33-year-old bystander who suffered shrapnel injuries to his limbs and chest was treated by the paramedics before being taken to a local hospital. ""It was a miracle that it did not explode in the nearest synagogue or in the shopping centre. It could have ended in dozens of deaths,"" Ayalon District Police Commander Haim Bublil said on Monday, according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper. The identity of the perpetrator is not yet known, but police suspect he was a Palestinian. In a separate development on Sunday, an Israeli security guard was killed by a Palestinian man at an industrial area near the settlement of Kedumim, in the north of the occupied West Bank, Israeli authorities said. Gideon Perry, a 38-year-old father of three, was fatally wounded when he was hit with a hammer by a labourer, who then stole his firearm and drove away. The local Israeli military commander, Maj-Gen Avi Bluth, said it was a “very serious terrorist attack” and that troops were in pursuit of the attacker. So far, no Palestinian armed groups have claimed they were behind the attack, which came three days after a deadly rampage by Israeli settlers at a Palestinian village near Kedumim. The Palestinian health ministry said a Palestinian man was shot dead as settlers set fire to a number of vehicles and homes in Jit, in an incident which brought swift and unusual condemnation from Israeli leaders.

Funeral prayers were held at Qatar’s Imam Muhammed bin Abdul Wahhab mosque - the largest in the country - before his body was taken in a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag for burial at a cemetery in Lusail, a city north of Doha. Several foreign officials were present at the funeral, including Turkey’s Vice-President Cevdet Yilmaz and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran’s capital. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel, though Israel has not claimed responsibility for his death. The funeral, a high-security affair, was attended by prominent figures from both Hamas and their Palestinian rivals Fatah - as well as members of the public. Hamas officials had earlier stood on the tarmac at Doha Airport as the plane carrying Haniyeh’s coffin landed from the Iranian capital Tehran on Thursday afternoon. Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday in honour of Haniyeh, while Hamas has called for ""roaring anger marches. . . from every mosque"" to take place after Friday prayers to protest Haniyeh's killing. At a separate funeral ceremony for Haniyeh which took place in Tehran on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers. He had earlier vowed that Israel would suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh had been based in Doha since about 2019. The Hamas political office moved to the Qatari capital in 2012, following the closure of its previous office in Damascus, Syria. Haniyeh had played a key role in indirect talks with Israel over a potential ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza. The heads of the CIA, Mossad and the intelligence services of Egypt and Qatar had attended negotiations in Doha. Haniyeh’s burial caps a week of soaring tensions in the Middle East, which escalated with the killing of 12 children and teenagers in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. The killing of Haniyeh left the leadership of Hamas in “a state of shock”, top Hamas officials told the BBC. The circumstances around his death remain unclear. Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. But a report in the New York Times, external, which cites seven officials, says Haniyeh was killed by a bomb that had been smuggled two months ago into the building where he was staying. The BBC has not been able to verify either of these claims.",Hamas leader Haniyeh buried in Qatar,Hamas leader Haniyeh buried in Qatar,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wvwyx07m1o,articles/article_2981.txt,results/article_2981.txt.json
2982,2024-10-19 20:20:46.967000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2yvw97egdo,"A Palestinian man from Gaza has told the BBC that the house the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in was his home for 15 years before he had to flee in May. Ashraf Abo Taha said he was ""shocked"" as he identified the partially destroyed building in Israeli drone footage of the incident as his home on Ibn Sena street in Rafah, southern Gaza. Sinwar, the key figure behind the 7 October attacks on Israel, was killed by Israeli troops on Wednesday. The Israeli military released drone footage that it said showed Sinwar in a partially destroyed house before he was killed.  Mr Abo Taha told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline that he had left his home in Rafah for Khan Younis on 6 May, when Israel ordered evacuations and began its military offensive in Rafah, and had not received any news of his house until now. Mr Abo Taha said his daughter first showed him the footage purportedly capturing Sinwar's last moments on social media, saying it depicted their house in Rafah. He initially didn't believe her, he said, until his brother confirmed the house was indeed his. ""I was like 'yes this is my house' and I saw the pictures and here I was shocked"", Mr Abo Taha said. He said he had no idea why Sinwar was there or how he got there. ""Never ever did me and my brothers and sons have anything to do with this,"" he said. The BBC has verified that pictures and videos provided by Mr Abo Taha of his home match imagery of the house where Sinwar was killed. BBC Verify compared and matched images of the home's window archways, external decorations on doorways, shelves, and armchairs from the footage. The BBC cannot independently verify that Mr Abo Taha owned the home. Who will lead Hamas after killing of Yahya Sinwar? The footage of Sinwar's killing was analysed by the BBC, and the house in which he was last seen was one of the few partially destroyed buildings in a neighbourhood with extensive damage. The Israeli assault on Rafah in May was met with strong international criticism, and triggered the exodus of more than a million Palestinians, according to the UN. Many had been forced to move for a second or third time, as they had been sheltering in and around Rafah after being displaced from other parts of Gaza. Mr Abo Taha said he had built his home in Rafah himself with the help of his siblings. It had cost some 200,000 shekels (£41,400) and had been in good condition when he left, he said. He described his home's orange sofas and an orange casserole dish, remembering the last time he saw them as he fled his home. ""These are memories because some of these were brought by my mum and they are very precious to me,"" he said. ""What happened has saddened me a lot, the house that I built and all my payments are gone,"" he said. ""Only God can compensate us.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led prayers for the Hamas leader, whose body will be buried in Qatar.  US media have quoted Iranian officials as saying the supreme leader has ordered a direct attack against Israel, which it says was responsible for the attack on Iranian soil. Israel has not commented on the assassination directly.  However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined. ""UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region. Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. While Haniyeh's funeral was still taking place, Israel's military said it had confirmed that Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran.

2984,2024-11-19 18:55:34.069000+00:00,/news/articles/c86qd99nqgyo,"The most senior Hamas leader outside Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, and other key figures in its negotiating team are no longer in Doha, Qatar’s government and a senior Palestinian official have said. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said Hamas’s office no longer had a function because Qatar had suspended its mediation efforts on a Gaza ceasefire deal, although he stressed that it was not permanently closed. The Palestinian official told the BBC the Hamas negotiators had adjusted their presence in the region and were keeping their locations secret to avoid embarrassing host countries. But they said it was likely Hayya was in Turkey as he had travelled there several times over the past two months. And while the official also denied reports that Qatar had formally asked Hamas to leave, they said the Gulf state seemed to be positioning itself carefully to avoid any tensions between the current administration of President Joe Biden and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Qatar has hosted Hamas’s political bureau since 2012 and played a key role in facilitating indirect negotiations between the group and Israel. But the recent developments suggest a shift in their relationship. Earlier this month, Qatar announced that it had paused its efforts to broker a Gaza ceasefire and said they would only resume “when the parties show willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war”. But it denied reports that Hamas leaders had been asked to leave. On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed at a media briefing, external that “the leaders of Hamas that are within the negotiating team are now not in Doha”. “As you know, they move between different capitals. I don’t want to get into details of what that means,” he added. “But what I can tell you very clearly is that the office of Hamas in Doha was created for the sake of the negotiating process. Obviously, when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function. ”He also stressed that “a decision to close down the office permanently is a decision that you will hear about from us directly and shouldn’t be part of media speculation”. On Monday, Hamas said in a Telegram statement that sources in the group had “denied what some Israeli media outlets had circulated about Hamas leadership leaving Qatar to Turkey"". It followed a similar denial from the Turkish foreign ministry, with sources telling the Turkish news channel NTV: ""Hamas political bureau members visit Turkey from time to time. Allegations that the Hamas political bureau moved to Turkey do not reflect the truth. ”US state department spokesman Matthew Miller meanwhile told a news conference in Washington that he was “not in a position to dispute the reports” about the whereabouts of Hamas’s leadership. “What I would say on behalf of the United States is that we don’t believe the leaders of a vicious terrorist organisation should be living comfortably anywhere, and that certainly includes in a major city of one of our key allies and partners,” he said. “A number of these individuals are under US indictment, have been under US indictment for some time, and we believe that they should be turned over to the United States,” he added. He also declined to speculate on whether there would be any consequences for Turkey as a Nato ally if it did take in the Hamas leaders. Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation - unlike Israel, the US, the UK and many other Western countries - and members of the group often spend time there. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas as a resistance movement and been fiercely critical of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,970 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. During a visit to Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his determination not to let Hamas have any role in governing Gaza after the war. He also once again vowed to ensure that all the hostages would be brought home alive and repeated his offer of $5m (£3.95m) for anyone who turned a hostage over to Israel. Israel says 97 hostages are still being held, 34 of whom are presumed dead. There are another four hostages who were kidnapped before 7 October, two of whom are believed to be dead.","Hamas leaders no longer in Doha but office not permanently closed, Qatar says","Hamas leaders no longer in Doha but office not permanently closed, Qatar says","palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86qd99nqgyo,articles/article_2984.txt,results/article_2984.txt.json

Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly.  The Israeli military said in a statement that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time of the air strike that it had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif is widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory. Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002. For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and has survived a reported seven assassination attempts, including one that reportedly saw him lose an eye. He was born in Gaza's Khan Younis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the late 1980s, he joined Hamas shortly after its formation and quickly rose to prominence within the group. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospectsIran vows revenge after Hamas leader assassinated in Tehran Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza. During his leadership of the al-Qassam brigades, he was credited with designing Hamas's signature weapon, the Qassam rocket. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. Enemies are known to have dubbed Deif ‘the cat with nine lives’, due to the fact he survived so many attempts on his life. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Druze children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran.

2986,2024-08-06 18:24:20.077000+00:00,/news/articles/cqxjjvdq7eyo,"After two days of lengthy negotiations in Doha, Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar as its new overall chief, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was assassinated in Tehran last week. Since 2017, Sinwar has served as the group's leader inside the Gaza strip. He will now become leader of its political wing. The Hamas leadership unanimously chose Sinwar to lead the movement, a senior Hamas official told the BBC. The announcement comes at a moment of soaring tensions in the Middle East, as Iran and its allies threaten retaliation for the killing of Haniyeh, which they blame on Israel. Israel has not commented. Hamas 'in shock' over Haniyeh deathKilling of Hamas leader 'doesn't help' ceasefire talks, says Biden Over the course of two days in Doha, intensive meetings involving Hamas’s leading figures hammered out the options for the group's next chief. Many scenarios were discussed, but ultimately, just two names were put forward: Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Hassan Darwish, a shadowy figure who heads the General Shura Council, a body that elects Hamas's Politburo. The council voted unanimously to choose Sinwar, in what one Hamas official described to the BBC as “a message of defiance to Israel”. “They killed Haniyeh, the flexible person who was open to solutions. Now they have to deal with Sinwar and the military leadership,” the official said. Prior to his death, Ismail Haniyeh was viewed by regional diplomats as a pragmatic figure compared to others in Hamas - a key driver of the group’s political outreach. Yahya Sinwar, on the other hand, is viewed as one of Hamas’s most extreme figures. Sinwar currently tops Israel’s most-wanted list. Israel's security agencies believe he masterminded the planning and execution of the 7 October 2023 attacks, which left over 1,200 people dead and 251 taken back into Gaza as hostages. ""The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organisation off the face of the Earth,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on X. “Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari told Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya. Sinwar has not been seen in public since the attacks in October, and is believed to be hiding “10 storeys underground” in Gaza, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in June. Javed Ali, a former US National Security Council official, told the BBC that Sinwar's appointment could further hinder ceasefire and hostage release talks as he is ""much more inflexible and much more difficult to negotiate with"". Sinwar was born in Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza in 1962. In the late 1980s, Sinwar founded the Hamas security service known as Majd, which among other things targeted alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel. He has spent much of his life in Israeli jail - and after his third arrest in 1988 he was sentenced to four life terms in prison. However, he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in the 2011 exchange for Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive for over five years by Hamas. The 61-year-old was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017, a position he served in until now.

According to Iranian media, an air strike hit a building for war veterans in Tehran where Haniyeh was staying at around 02:00 (22:30 GMT). Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

According to Hamas, Haniyeh was in Tehran to take part in the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was sworn in on Tuesday. His death could now delay efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, as he was a critical interlocutor in the negotiations brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt. Several countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Russia and Qatar have condemned the attack. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the assassination was ""something we were not aware of or involved in"". Hamas's armed wing said Haniyeh's death would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel, and has declared three days of national mourning.  Haniyeh’s death comes just hours after Israel claimed it killed the top military commander of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group, also backed by Iran. Israel said it killed Fuad Shukr in an air strike, in retaliation for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights at the weekend. Hezbollah has not yet confirmed that a senior commander was killed by an Israeli attack in Beirut on Tuesday, but has said Shukr was in a building which was targeted. ""Since the incident, the civil defence teams have been working to lift the rubble steadily, but slowly, due to the situation of the destroyed classes, and we are still waiting for the result,"" a statement released by the group on Wednesday said. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the country was not seeking to escalate with Hezbollah, but was ""prepared to handle all scenarios"". Haniyeh was a prominent member of Hamas in the late 1980s and was imprisoned by Israel for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising. He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders. Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but he was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence. Haniyeh rejected his sacking as ""unconstitutional"", stressing that his government ""would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people"", and continued to rule in Gaza. He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the past several years. His official funeral will be held on Thursday in Tehran, with the burial taking place on Friday in Doha, Qatar, according to a senior Hamas official. Following Hamas's attack on 7 October which killed 1,200 people, Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in the Gaza Strip which has killed at least 39,445 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The Israeli military said in response that it did “not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas’s claims”. Abu Ubaida, the spokesman for the al-Qassam Brigades, said on Telegram that the shootings had happened in two separate incidents and that “attempts are being made to save” the lives of those wounded. He did not identify the hostages or give more details about when or where the attacks occurred, saying an investigation was under way. He blamed the incident on what he said were Israeli “massacres” of Palestinians. The Israeli military said: “We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message and will update with any more information that we obtain. ”This is the first time that Hamas has said that its guards have killed hostages during the continuing war in Gaza. Previously, it has said that hostages have been killed by Israeli air strikes. In the past, Israel has dismissed Hamas statements on the deaths of hostages as psychological warfare. According to Israeli tallies, 251 people were kidnapped during the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October in which some 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed. It is thought that 111 of the hostages abducted by Hamas remain in Gaza, including the bodies of 39 who the Israeli military says are dead. Another two Israeli civilians who independently entered the Palestinian territory are also being held, as well as the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in the Gaza war in 2014. At least 39,929 people have been killed in Gaza during the current conflict, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas’s statement comes as talks aimed at ending the war and bringing home remaining hostages are due to resume in Cairo or Doha on Thursday.

2990,2024-08-14 18:28:13.476000+00:00,/news/articles/c0e8gzyp8e2o,"A senior Hamas official told the BBC that it will not participate in the indirect talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal due to resume in Doha on Thursday. The Palestinian armed group wanted a roadmap for implementing the agreement and would “not engage in negotiations for the sake of negotiations in order to provide cover for Israel to continue its war”, the official said. He reiterated that the roadmap should be based on the proposed deal outlined by US President Joe Biden at the end of May and accused Israel of adding “new conditions”. Israel’s prime minister has denied doing so and said Hamas has been the one demanding changes. The talks are still expected to take place even without Hamas, as US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators say they could use them to put together a plan that resolves the remaining issues. They suffered several setbacks last month and have been suspended since Hamas's political leader and chief negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran. The US hopes that finalising a deal could deter Iran from retaliating for the assassination against Israel - which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement  - and avert a regional conflict. The US has ramped up its diplomatic efforts ahead of the talks. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said in a phone call that ""no party in the region should take actions that would undermine efforts to reach a deal,"" a state department statement said. Mr Blinken also spoke separately to Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, the state department said. US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris were also briefed by their national security team on the latest developments in the Middle East, the White House said. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,960 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Last week, the leaders of the US, Egypt and Qatar issued a joint statement calling on Israel and Hamas to resume urgent discussions on a deal that would bring relief to the people of Gaza as well as the 111 remaining hostages, 39 of whom are presumed dead. A framework agreement was ""now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude"", they said, adding that they were prepared to present a bridging proposal that overcame their differences if necessary. Israel responded by saying it would send a team of negotiators to take part in Thursday’s talks. But Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - asked the mediators to present a plan based on where talks were a month and a half ago instead of engaging in any new rounds of negotiations. On Wednesday, a senior Hamas official confirmed that its representatives would not attend the meeting, despite many of them being based in the Qatari capital. “We want a roadmap to implement what we have already agreed based on President Biden’s ceasefire plan and the Security Council resolution, which guarantees Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, specifically from the Philadelphi corridor [running along the border with Egypt], and allows the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza without restrictions, and allows the flow of humanitarian aid,” he told the BBC. “It is Israel which added new conditions and reneged on its previous agreement,” he added. The first phase of the deal outlined by Mr Biden on 31 May and endorsed by the UN Security Council would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that unpublished documents showed Israel had relayed a list of five new conditions in a letter on 27 July, external, which added to the principles it had set out on 27 May and Mr Biden presented days later. It said the May proposal had talked of the “withdrawal of Israeli forces eastwards away from densely populated areas along the borders in all areas of the Gaza Strip”, but that the July letter had included a map indicating Israel would remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor. The report also said the letter had added a stipulation that an agreed upon mechanism should be established to ensure only unarmed civilians returning to northern Gaza were allowed through the Israeli-controlled Netzarim corridor, which effectively divides the territory in two. In response to the report, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement saying the charge that he had added new conditions was “false”, external, describing them instead as “essential clarifications”. “Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 27 July letter does not introduce extra conditions and certainly does not contradict or undermine the 27 May proposal. In fact, Hamas is the one that demanded 29 changes to the 27 May proposal, something the prime minister refused to do,” it added, without providing details about Hamas’s demands. Later on Tuesday, President Biden conceded that the negotiations were “getting hard”, but vowed that he was “not giving up”. He also said he believed an agreement would help avert the possibility of retaliation against Israel by Iran, Hamas’s main backer, for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. When asked by a reporter if Iran “could. . . stop doing action if a ceasefire deal is possible”, he replied: ""That's my expectation but we'll see. ""Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the Hamas leader’s killing, has warned Iran that it would “exact a heavy price for any aggression”. Iran has dismissed Western calls for restraint and insisted that “a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right”.

Nagar, a prison guard at the facility where Eichmann was kept, was chosen for the task and did not volunteer. He said he had nightmares about it for years afterwards. The hanging was the only judicial execution ever held in the state of Israel. Eichmann, one of the leading architects of the Final Solution aimed at wiping out Europe's Jews, was abducted by Israeli agents from Argentina in 1960 and sentenced a year later after a landmark public trial. Nagar was born in Yemen in the late 1930s and moved to Israel as an orphan in 1948. His exact age is not clear. After serving in the military, he joined Israel's prison service and was selected as a personal guard for Eichmann at Ramle prison. His duties included tasting the prisoner's food in case it was poisoned. He said he was selected at random to carry out the execution, and Eichmann was hanged on 30 May 1962. Nagar's identity remained secret for another 30 years, amid fears of reprisals, but was revealed by Israeli journalists in 1992. In the following years he gave a series of interviews, providing sometimes graphic details of the hanging and its aftermath. He explained that after the deed was done, he was told to load the corpse into an oven for cremation, but his hands were shaking and he was unable to walk unaided. For some time afterwards he suffered from PTSD and nightmares. He later became religious and moved to the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, media reports say. A documentary called The Hangman was made about him in 2010. Eichmann played a key role in the 1942 Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis' annihilation of European Jewry was planned, and was seen as the logistical mastermind of the Final Solution. He lived incognito in Germany after the end of World War Two and fled to Argentina in 1950. Israeli intelligence located him in 1960, kidnapped him and brought him to Israel to stand trial on charges including war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people. He did not deny the charges or the Holocaust but said he was following orders. After a trial that was filmed and broadcast on TV, he was convicted on most counts and sentenced to death.",Hangman of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann dies,Hangman of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann dies,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czd59lvrnn5o,articles/article_2991.txt,results/article_2991.txt.json

In a post , externalon Twitter/X, Biden administration official Phil Gordon said Ms Harris ""has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups"". The statement came after leaders of the Uncommitted movement - which has urged Democrats to boycott the election over US support for Israel - said Ms Harris had ""expressed an openness"" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo. Mr Gordon seemed to dispute that report. He added that Ms Harris ""will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law"". His statement comes as tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. Iran has threatened to ""punish"" Israel after the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not claimed responsibility. The US has accelerated its weapon supplies to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid in Gaza. Since Mr Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his second in command, leaders of the Uncommitted movement have been pressing Ms Harris to halt US military support for Israel.  He's the new VP pick. To his students, he's Mr WalzIn one US state, women politicians dominate. What pointers can it offer Kamala Harris? Ms Harris's rally on Wednesday took place in a swing state that is home to the largest Arab-American community in the US. Leaders of the Uncommitted movement said in a statement that they had a chance to speak to the vice-president before the rally and told her that the US needed an arms embargo. ""We want to support you, Vice-President Harris, and our voters need to see you turn a new page on Gaza policy that includes embracing an arms embargo,"" Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of Uncommitted, said he told the Democratic nominee. Afterwards, a number of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered at the rally and interrupted Ms Harris's speech, chanting: ""Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won’t vote for genocide"". Ms Harris responded by telling the crowd: ""Everyone's voice matters. "" But as the protestors continued to chant, she stopped again and said: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking. ”Both JD Vance, Trump's running mate, and Ms Harris have made a number campaign stops in the Midwest this week as they try to woo voters in critical swing states. The latest poll, from Marquette University Law School, shows Ms Harris is leading Trump 53% to 47% among likely voters, a big bump from when Mr Biden was still in the race and was trailing Trump nationally and in several battleground states.

2993,2024-07-25 15:26:01.305000+00:00,/news/articles/cg3eppp0n57o,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris - who's expected to be the Democratic nominee for November's presidential election - has held what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Striking a tougher tone than President Joe Biden, Ms Harris said she made clear her ""serious concerns"" about casualties in Gaza, telling Mr Netanyahu how Israel defended itself mattered. ""It is time for this war to end,"" she said after their face-to-face talks at the White House. Ms Harris also stressed the need for a path to a two-state solution, while calling on Americans to be aware of ""nuance"" on the conflict. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu met Mr Biden, who stepped down from his re-election campaign on Sunday.  Mr Netanyahu's meetings at the White House came a day after he gave a fiery speech to Congress, vowing “total victory” against Hamas, as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. The prime minister faces pressure both at home and abroad to bring an end to the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month. Mr Biden's staunch support of Israel has infuriated many left-wing activists, whose support the Democrats may need if they are to win November's presidential election. Given that, there is also considerable interest in the position Ms Harris might take towards Israel should she replace Mr Biden in the White House. After meeting Mr Netanyahu for about 40 minutes, Ms Harris said she had an ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel and its right to defend itself. She noted the conflict began on 7 October when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people. ""Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters,"" Ms Harris said, expressing concern about the ""dire humanitarian situation"" in Gaza. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,"" she said. ""Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war,"" she added. ""Let's bring the hostages home, and let's bring much-needed relief to the Palestinian people. "" Mr Netanyahu is due to meet Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday.  As he met Mr Biden earlier, the prime minister said he had known him for 40 years - and that the US president had known every Israeli premier over the last half a century. ""From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Mr Biden ""on the great issues before us"" over the next several months. The US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli prime minister that he had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant. At a news briefing, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu had discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach ""compromises"" in peace talks. While Mr Kirby added that ""gaps remain"" in the US-Israel relationship, it was still ""healthy"". ""By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,"" Mr Kirby said, adding that Mr Biden was ""very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister"". The US and Israeli leaders also held a closed-door meeting with the families of seven US citizens still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Following the meeting, Jonathan Dekel-Chen - whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October - told reporters that the meeting was ""productive and honest"". He did not provide further details. ""We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,"" he said.

2994,2024-08-26 23:11:37.903000+00:00,/news/articles/cze5w2wd4x0o,"“Burn Gaza now, nothing less!” When the deputy speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, posted this comment on X in November, the platform blocked him and asked him to delete it. Nissim Vaturi did as they asked, and his account has since been reactivated, but he did not apologise. His comment is one of many controversial remarks that have been made by some high-profile Israelis as the country’s armed forces carry out air strikes and ground operations in Gaza, in response to Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. On the day of the attacks, he had posted: “Now we all have one common goal - erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth, external. ”That post, which is still visible on X, was cited in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the Gaza war. Israel has called the case ""wholly unfounded"" and based on ""biased and false claims"". As part of an interim judgement in January, the ICJ ruled that Israel must prevent public statements inciting genocide. Although the court does not have the power to enforce this, Israel agreed to submit a report detailing the action it had taken to investigate and prosecute possible instances of incitement. The court confirmed that the report was received in February, but has not made its contents public. Some legal experts believe Israel is not doing enough to investigate potential cases. “Israelis who incite genocide or use genocidal rhetoric are immune from prosecution,” says Israeli human rights lawyer, Michael Sfard. Proving incitement to genocide, which is a crime under international and Israeli law, is difficult. Genocide is defined as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. But distinguishing between inciting genocide and inciting violence or racism - and what could be considered free speech - can be complex. The BBC has looked at several pronouncements made since the ICJ’s order to see if they could break the ruling and consulted legal experts for their assessment. And although this judgement was directed at Israel, we have also examined language used by some Hamas officials who have made speeches about repeating their attack of 7 October. A pro-Palestinian human rights organisation made up of a network of experts and researchers around the world who monitor the conflict, Law for Palestine, has looked at cases where it believes Israeli officials and other public figures have incited genocide. Its list includes some statements by Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Mr Ben-Gvir has been advocating a policy to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza, saying Israelis should settle there. He leads an ultranationalist party which is widely criticised for espousing racially discriminatory, anti-Arab policies. He has previous convictions from an Israeli court - which date from before he entered government - for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Two days after the ICJ ruling in January, he advocated a policy to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza and replace them with Israeli settlers. He said that to avoid a repeat of Hamas’s attack on Israel “we need to return home and control the territory [Gaza]… encouraging migration and giving the death penalty to terrorists”, proposing that any emigration should be voluntary. “We consider the calling to displacement of the Gaza population as part of the ethnic cleansing that is ongoing in Gaza,” says Law for Palestine’s founder, Ihsan Adel. He believes those calls should be considered incitement to genocide, and that genocide is happening - an accusation Israel denies. Not everyone agrees with his assessment, though. “I'm definitely not going to defend such statements, but they do not rise to the level of genocide,” says Anne Herzberg, a legal adviser at NGO Monitor, which reports on international NGO activity from a pro-Israel perspective. Neither Mr Ben-Gvir nor Mr Vaturi responded to BBC requests for comment. The link between what politicians say and what Israeli soldiers say was a core part of South Africa’s case at the ICJ. In a YouTube video from late 2023, a group of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers can be heard chanting: “Occupy, expel and settle. ” And soldiers have made other videos since the ICJ ruling in January mocking and celebrating the destruction of Gaza. The IDF told us that it examines reports of videos online and that if a criminal offence is suspected, the military police investigate and “in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the footage is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly”. The spotlight has also fallen on Israel’s religious leaders. Rabbi Eliyahu Mali attracted attention after he gave a talk in March at a conference for Israel’s Zionist yeshivas - Jewish religious schools with a strong belief in the State of Israel. Rabbi Mali is the head of a yeshiva that is part of a network that receives funding from Israel‘s Ministry of Defence. Its students mix Torah study with military service. He described the talk as being about the “treatment of the civilian population in Gaza during the war”. A clip of it was shared online. After citing a 12th Century Jewish scholar on holy wars, Rabbi Mali said: “[And if so] the basic rule that we have when we are fighting a mitzvah war, in this case Gaza, according to the scriptures, ‘You shall not let a soul remain alive,’ the explanation is very clear - if you don’t kill them, they will kill you. ”In Judaism, a mitzvah war is one which includes defending Jewish life and sovereignty and is considered obligatory as opposed to one of choice. We contacted Rabbi Mali and a response, sent on his behalf, said that his words had been “grossly misrepresented by excerpts being taken out of context”. It said that he had set out what the position was in ancient times but that he had “made it very clear that anyone following the Biblical commandment today would be causing the army and the nation extreme harm” and that under national law “it is forbidden to harm the civilian population from a child to an old man”. We watched the full talk and on a few occasions he reminded the audience of those points, including in the conclusion, and also saying at the start: “You need to do exactly what the army orders say. ”However, during the talk, he specifically mentioned the people of Gaza saying: “I think there is a difference between the civilian population in other places and the civilian population in Gaza,” adding an unsubstantiated claim that “95% to 98% are interested in our demise, that's a majority, that's stupefying. ”When an audience member asked about babies he replied: ”The same… The Torah is saying: ‘You shall not let a soul remain alive’… Today he’s a baby, tomorrow he’s a boy, tomorrow he’s a warrior. ”In the talk, the rabbi also recounted what he said to his son, who went to fight after the 7 October attacks. He said he should “kill everything that moves”. He explained his position by adding that his son’s commander had told him the same thing and that he instructed his son to ”listen to the commander’s orders”. Later, he reiterated that he did not expect soldiers to do what was laid out in the Torah. He said that if the laws of the state contradicted the laws of the Torah, it was the state law that should be followed and “the laws of the state only want to kill the terrorists and not the civilian population”. Eitay Mack, a lawyer from the Israeli group Tag Meir that campaigns against racism and discrimination, says he has asked police to investigate the rabbi on suspicion of incitement to commit genocide, violence and terrorism. He says he is still waiting to hear if the investigation he requested will be carried out. Another claim made by South Africa at the ICJ hearing was about “genocidal messages being routinely broadcast - without censure or sanction - in Israeli media”. In February, on the right-wing Channel 14,  journalist Yaki Adamker said: ""The Gazans, as far as I am concerned, can starve to death. What do I care about them?”In April, an Israeli journalist on the most-watched channel in the country, Channel 12, Yehuda Schlesinger, echoed similar sentiments, saying: “There are no innocents in the Gaza Strip, there aren’t. They voted for Hamas, they want Hamas. ”For Anne Herzberg, from NGO Monitor, this may show “a disturbing lack of empathy for people in Gaza and what they’re going through,” but “it’s not calling for genocide”. The BBC contacted both broadcasters but received no response. Yehuda Schlesinger replied, highlighting the atrocities of 7 October. When it comes to whether the authorities should regulate what is broadcast more tightly, Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard warns that “regulators, which is the state, have to make sure that public broadcasting is not exploited” by people making provocative comments. While the ICJ ruling on preventing inciting genocide was directed at Israel, Hamas has also been accused of making statements with “genocidal intent”. “The annihilationist language of Hamas's charter is repeated regularly by its leaders,” says Tal Becker, legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry. In 2021, Yahya Sinwar, who has just become the overall leader of Hamas said: “We support the elimination of Israel through jihad and armed struggle, this is our doctrine. ”And, more recently, some Hamas officials have claimed they want to repeat the 7 October attacks, during which about 1,200 people were killed - mostly civilians - and 251 were taken hostage. In November, a member of Hamas's political bureau, Ghazi Hamad, said: “We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again and again. ”Around the same time, Hamas leader abroad, Khaled Mashaal, said that 7 October “opened a highway towards eliminating Israel"". Hamas did not respond to the BBC’s request for comment. Many want to see the group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, EU and other countries - held to account. “It’s quite clear that they do have genocidal intent, and we hear very little about investigating Hamas, and I think that's a real missing piece in this entire conflict,” says Anne Herzberg from NGO Monitor. The UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese - whose own criticisms of Israeli actions have been strongly contested, in particular in Israel and the United States - agrees Hamas leaders should be held accountable. But she says: “When assessing genocide, one is to look at the words spoken by leaders, but also the capacity to commit genocide, which Hamas per se doesn't seem to have. ” Unlike Israel, Hamas cannot be taken to the ICJ because it is not a state. However a different body, the International Criminal Court (ICC), can hold individuals to account. In May its prosecutor applied for arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh (Haniyeh has since been killed in Iran and Israel says it killed Deif in Gaza) for crimes against humanity, and war crimes. He also sought warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Hamas and Israel reacted with outrage. As for what Israeli authorities are doing to prevent and prosecute people suspected of inciting violence, the country’s attorney general and state attorney have acknowledged that any statements calling for intentional harm to civilians “may amount to a criminal offence, including the offence of incitement”. Just before the ICJ hearing in January they said that several cases were being examined. Recently however, Haaretz reported that the state prosecutor recommended that no criminal investigations be opened against senior public figures, including ministers and members of Knesset, who have ""called to harm civilians in the Gaza Strip”. The final decision rests with the attorney general. The BBC contacted Israel’s state attorney, police commissioner and Ministry of Justice for comment. Only the Ministry of Justice replied, saying they have to balance “the constitutional right to freedom of speech… while safeguarding against harmful incitement”. They added: “Law enforcement authorities constantly act to curtail incitement offences, and these efforts have been prioritised by Israel's attorney general in recent months. ”And as the ICJ continues to work toward a final ruling in its case, people continue to die - since October more than 40,000 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in Gaza, according to its Hamas-run health ministry.

The Israeli military said it had killed 20 “terrorists” there over the past day, and that one of its soldiers had also been killed in the north. Hamas said its fighters had targeted Israeli forces in Jabalia and its refugee camp, while the Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli strikes had killed 19 people. Civilians in Jabalia and nearby Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia have been told to evacuate south by the military, which said on Sunday that intelligence indicated Hamas was trying to “rebuild its operational capabilities” in the region. It warned that the operation would involve “systematic strikes and the radical destruction of terrorist structures”. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday evening that Israeli forces were besieging the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia and that it would run out of fuel within hours. It also said patients and medical personnel had been asked to evacuate the hospital, as well as the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals. Israeli forces launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages.

On Monday, Jabalia resident Asmaa Tayeh told the BBC that she and her family had had to leave their home for the fourth time in a year. They have returned to her grandparents’ house in the al-Nasr district of Gaza City and, like many civilians in the north, are reluctant to move south, fearing that if they do they will not ever make it home. Despite Israeli assurances, Palestinians fear the military is planning to implement a plan, proposed by the former head of Israel’s national security council, to completely empty northern Gaza of the 300,000 to 500,000 civilians believed to be living there. According to Giora Eiland’s plan, the north would then be declared a “closed military zone” and the estimated 5,000 Hamas fighters there would be put under siege in order to force the group to release the remaining Israeli hostages. “The situation is getting so dangerous that we don’t have so much hope that we’ll go back,” Asmaa said. The Israeli military also ordered civilians in parts of the southern city of Khan Younis to evacuate after Hamas fired rockets towards Israel from there on Monday, lightly wounding two women in Kfar Chabad in central Israel. In central Gaza, the civil defence agency said 17 people, including children, were killed when a three-storey home in Bureij refugee camp was hit in an Israeli strike overnight. Medics at a hospital in nearby Nuseirat refugee camp confirmed the death toll, according to AFP news agency. The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas operatives in the camp and that it “conducted a precise strike on a structure from which a terrorist cell planned terror activities”.

Naim Qassem replaces long-term leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last month. He is one of the few senior Hezbollah leaders who remains alive, after Israel killed most of the group’s leadership in a series of attacks. The appointment comes as the conflict in Lebanon intensified in recent weeks.  For more than 30 years, Naim Qassem was Hezbollah’s deputy secretary general and one of the group's most recognised faces. Hezbollah said he was elected by the Shura Council, in accordance with the group’s rules. His whereabouts are unclear, however some reports suggest he has fled to Iran, which is Hezbollah’s main supporter. He was born in Beirut in 1953 to a family from Lebanon's south. Qassem was one of Hezbollah's founding members and since Nasrallah's death in an Israeli air strike he has made three televised addresses. In one speech, he said a ceasefire was the only way Israel could guarantee the return of its residents to the north. Announcing Qassem's promotion, Hezbollah released a statement describing him as ""bearing the blessed banner in this march"". The statement also honoured the late Nasrallah and others killed in the conflict. The new Hezbollah leadership was expected to be passed to cleric Hashem Safieddine, but on 22 October it was revealed that he had been killed in an Israeli air strike nearly three weeks prior. Reacting to Qassem's appointment on social media, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant described it as a ""temporary appointment"" and ""not for long"".

The Lebanese health ministry said at least 60 people were killed and more than 50 wounded. The Israeli military has yet to comment on the attack. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. Over the past year, more than 2,700 people have been killed and nearly 12,500 injured in Lebanon, according to the country's health ministry.

2997,2024-09-17 13:41:09.123000+00:00,/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo,"Nine people, including a child, have been killed after handheld pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah to communicate exploded across Lebanon, the country’s health minister says. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among 2,800 other people who were wounded by the simultaneous blasts in Beirut and several other regions. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said the pagers belonged “to employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions” and confirmed the deaths of eight fighters. The group blamed Israel for what it called “this criminal aggression” and vowed that it would get “just retribution”. The Israeli military declined to comment. Hours before the explosions, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah attacks on the north of the country to allow the safe return of displaced residents was an official war goal. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Iran-backed Palestinian group. In its latest statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said it would carry on its ""operations in support of Gaza"", adding that this was a “continuous path separate from the hard price that awaits the enemy in response to its massacre on Tuesday”. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. The UN's spokesman said the latest developments in Lebanon were ""extremely concerning, especially given that this is taking place within a context that is extremely volatile"". Many Lebanese were in a state of shock and disbelief on Tuesday evening, unable to get their heads around an event that was unprecedented in scale and nature. Hezbollah said an unspecified number of pagers - which the group relies on heavily for communications due to the risk of mobile phones being hacked or tracked - exploded at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) in the capital Beirut and many other areas. One CCTV video showed an explosion in a man’s bag or pocket at a supermarket. He is then seen falling backwards to the ground and crying out in pain as other shoppers run for cover. Hours later, ambulances were still rushing to hospitals overwhelmed with the number of casualties, 200 of whom the health minister said were in a critical condition. Outside, relatives were waiting in the hope of receiving updates. The LAU Medical Centre in Beirut's Ashrafieh district closed its main gate and was limiting the number of people getting in. “It’s very sensitive and some scenes are horrific,” one staff member told the BBC. Most of the wounds were at the level of the waist, face, eyes and hands, he said, adding: “A lot of casualties have lost fingers, in some cases all of them. ”The wife of Iranian ambassador Mojtaba Amani said he was ""slightly injured"" by one of the explosions and that he was ""doing well"" in hospital. Hezbollah's media office announced the deaths of eight fighters. It did not give details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem"". A source close to the group told AFP news agency that the son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar and the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member in the Bekaa Valley were among those killed. Later, the source said the son of another lawmaker, Hassan Fadlallah, was wounded, having initially reported that he was dead. Fourteen people were also wounded by exploding pagers in neighbouring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting alongside government forces in the country's civil war, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,” Hezbollah said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “This treacherous and criminal enemy will certainly get his just retribution on this sinful aggression from where it counts and from where it does not count,” it added. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also blamed Israel for the explosions, saying that they represented a “serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards”. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he told his Lebanese counterpart that he ""strongly condemned Israeli terrorism"". The US, Israel's closest ally, denied any involvement and urged Iran not to heighten tensions. Hezbollah did not say what it believed had caused the pagers to explode. The Wall Street Journal cited a source as saying the affected devices were from a new shipment that Hezbollah had received in recent days. A Hezbollah official also told the newspaper some people had felt the pagers heat up before the blasts. Overheated lithium-ion batteries can catch fire, but experts said hacking into the pagers and making them overheat would not usually cause such explosions. A former British Army munitions expert, who asked not to be named, told the BBC the pagers would have likely been packed with between 10g and 20g of military-grade high explosive, hidden inside a fake electronic component. Once armed by a signal, called an alphanumeric text message, the next person to use the device would have triggered the explosive, the expert said. Lina Khatib, a Middle East analyst at the UK-based Chatham House think tank, told the BBC: ""Israel has been engaging in cyber operations against Hezbollah for several months, but this security breach is the largest in scale. ”Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based senior fellow of the American think tank the Atlantic Council, said: “Israel in one fell swoop has rendered combat ineffective hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah fighters, in some cases permanently. ”He warned that Hezbollah's leaders would now “face extreme pressure from the ranks and supporters to retaliate heavily”, describing it as ""the most dangerous moment"" in the Hezbollah-Israel conflict since October. A statement put out by the Israeli military on Tuesday evening did not comment on the pager explosions, but said the chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi had held a situational assessment with commanders ""focusing on readiness in both offence and defence in all arenas"". It also said there was no change in defensive guidelines to the Israeli public but asked them to remain alert and vigilant. Earlier in the day, the military said an air strike had killed three “Hezbollah terrorists operating within a terrorist infrastructure site” in the Blida area, near Lebanon’s border with Israel. Lebanon’s health ministry confirmed that three people had been killed in an Israeli strike, while Hezbollah’s media office said it had carried out missile and drone attacks targeting Israeli troops and military sites. Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service also said it had foiled a Hezbollah bomb attack targeting an unnamed former senior Israeli security official. Hezbollah did not comment on the accusation. This comes at a time when Israel's government is threatening to step up its military effort against Hezbollah. On Tuesday morning, Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of 60,000 residents displaced in the north by Hezbollah attacks an official goal of the Gaza war. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein on Monday that the only way to return northern residents was through ""military action"". “The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said. Since the hostilities escalated in October, at least 589 people have been killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, according to the Lebanese health ministry. On the Israeli side, 25 civilians and 21 members of security forces have been killed, the Israeli government says.

Late on Wednesday, the Iran-backed group said Fuad Shukr's body had been found in the rubble of a building that was hit on Tuesday. Four other people were killed in the strike, including two children. Earlier, the Israeli military said Shukr had been the target of an ""intelligence-based elimination"". It said the strike was a response to a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, which Israel says the commander helped plan. Hezbollah has denied having any involvement. Fuad Shukr, who was in his early sixties, is believed to be a key military adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The strike targeted a building in Haret Hreik, a part of the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. It is a fortified, densely populated area. Dahiyeh itself is surrounded by checkpoints. The children killed in the air strike were a 10-year-old boy and a his six-year-old sister. Shukr will be buried on Thursday, the statement said. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the attack a ""criminal act"". An Israeli reaction to Saturday's rocket attack on the Golan had been widely expected. The country's security cabinet had authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to decide how to retaliate. A retaliation from Hezbollah is now almost certain. In the past, the heavily-armed, Iranian-supported group has responded to the killings of senior members by firing barrages of rockets into Israel. Shortly before Hezbollah's announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised speech acknowledging that ""challenging days lie ahead"". He added: ""Since the strike in Beirut there are threats sounding from all directions. We are prepared for any scenario. ""Early on Wednesday, the political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas - which is also backed by Iran - was killed in a attack in the Iranian capital. Israel has not commented, but it has promised to destroy Hamas following the 7 October attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people. Fears of a regional war have led to international calls for all sides to show restraint. There had been regular fighting between Hezbollah and Israel but hostilities have escalated since Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October. Hezbollah - which supports Hamas - opened up a limited second front in Israel's north, and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. And while so far they have stopped short of an all-out war, near daily attacks have left communities in Israel and Lebanon devastated.",Hezbollah confirms commander died  in Israeli strike,Hezbollah confirms commander died  in Israeli strike,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cldy0zpyq77o,articles/article_2999.txt,results/article_2999.txt.json

The IDF added seven soldiers had been severely injured in the attack on a base ""adjacent to Binyamina"" - a town around 20 miles (33km) to the south of Haifa. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted a training camp of the IDF's Golani Brigade in the area, which is based between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The armed group's media office said the strike was in response to Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon and Beirut on Thursday.

The group said it targeted the camp in northern Israel using a ""swarm of drones"". The attack was one of the biggest on an Israeli position in more than a year. The Israeli ambulance service, Magen David Adom (MDA), earlier said 61 people had been injured in the attack - including three critically. It added 37 of them had been taken to eight regional hospitals, either by ambulance or helicopter. In a statement before the IDF confirmed the deaths, MDA said that alongside the three critically injured, 18 of the victims were in a moderate condition, 31 sustained mild injuries and nine people were ""suffering anxiety"". The reason for the discrepancy in the number of critical injuries between MDA and the IDF is not clear. Israeli censorship rules had initially prevented media outlets reporting exactly where or what was targeted, before the IDF confirmed it was the Binyamina base. Some Israeli media outlets have reported the base was hit by a low-level drone launched from Lebanon - a relatively unsophisticated weapon that appears not to have activated early-warning alarms. Throughout the evening, television bulletins, social media posts and online reports showed footage of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, taking casualties to hospitals across northern Israel. Many of the wounded have been evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Centre in nearby Hadera - with others being taken to hospitals in Tel Hashomer, Haifa, Afula and Netanya. Details are still scarce but many of the injured appear to have been in a communal canteen at the time and were caught completely by surprise. Images circulating on social media appear to show an empty mess hall with a hole in the roof.

3004,2024-11-25 03:48:07.838000+00:00,/news/articles/c3vl4w36wypo,"Israel's military says around 250 rockets have been fired by Hezbollah across the border from Lebanon, marking one of the heaviest bombardments of Israel since fighting intensified in September. Several people were injured and buildings damaged in northern and central Israel, some of them near Tel Aviv, Israel's police said. The attacks followed an Israeli air strike on central Beirut on Saturday, in which the Lebanese health ministry said 29 people were killed. Also on Sunday, Israeli media widely reported that Israel and Lebanon were moving towards a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting with the Iran-backed militia, Hezbollah. Following reports of heavy fire from Lebanon, Israel's police said it had received reports of rocket debris falling in the Tel Aviv area. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a direct hit on one neighbourhood had left ""houses in flames and ruins"". Rockets fell in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, and in some northern areas: Haifa, Nahariya and Kfar Blum, Israeli media reported. Hezbollah, which has previously vowed to respond to attacks on Beirut by targeting Tel Aviv, said it had launched precision missiles at two military sites in the city and nearby. Later, the IDF said it had completed strikes on 12 Hezbollah command centres in Dahieh, a stronghold for the group in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon's health ministry on Sunday raised the death toll from 20 to 29 from a massive Israeli strike launched without warning on central Beirut. It said a total of 84 people had been killed in the country Saturday. The IDF has not commented on Saturday's attack, but Israeli media reported at the time that it was an attempt to kill Mohammed Haydar, a top Hezbollah official. Israel’s stated goal in its war against Hezbollah is to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who have been displaced from communities in northern Israel because of the group’s attacks. In Lebanon, more than 3,670 people have been killed and at least 15,400 injured since October 2023, according to Lebanese authorities, with more than one million forced from their homes. Over the past fortnight, Israel has intensified its campaign against Hezbollah. On Sunday the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, citing Israeli and US officials, reported that Israel had given the ""green light"" to advance a US-proposed ceasefire deal with Lebanon, but indicated some gaps remained.",Hezbollah fires rocket barrages into Israel after deadly Beirut strikes,Hezbollah fires rocket barrages into Israel after deadly Beirut strikes,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vl4w36wypo,articles/article_3004.txt,results/article_3004.txt.json
3005,2024-08-01 20:29:55.142000+00:00,/news/articles/cn05v009n2ko,"In Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiya, the stronghold of Hezbollah, large crowds wearing black joined the funeral for Fuad Shukr, a senior commander of the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement, and the most high-profile member to have been assassinated by Israel during these current hostilities. They carried placards with Shukr’s face, waved the yellow-and-green Hezbollah flag and chanted some of the group’s slogans, sometimes with their fists in the air. According to the Israeli military, Shukr was behind a missile strike that killed 12 children and teenagers on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last Saturday. Hezbollah has denied involvement, although it initially claimed an attack on a nearby military base, which raised the possibility that the missile missed its intended targeted. Shukr, who was also known as Sayyed Mohsin, was said to be a close adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, the influential and long-time Hezbollah leader. As people were gathered, Nasrallah gave a televised speech that was watched closely for any indication of Hezbollah’s possible next moves. The conflict with Israel had entered a “new phase"", he said, speaking from a secret location, as he always does for security reasons. The enemy must wait for the “inevitable response” because it had crossed “red lines”, he added, saying that the reaction would be proportionate to Israel’s targeting of a civilian building. His tone seemed to indicate that the group remained uninterested in another major war with Israel. But there are concerns that they could be sliding into one. “I’m not afraid of war. We’re ready for whatever Sayyed [Hassan] Nasrallah decides to do,” one man in the crowd told me. “Inshallah,” said another, meaning God willing, when asked if he believed that Hezbollah would retaliate for the killing. Shukr's killing on Tuesday - an attack that killed six other people, including two young siblings - renewed fears that the relatively contained conflict between Hezbollah and Israel could escalate into an all-out war, with the potential to engulf the entire Middle East. Hezbollah says its campaign, which started a day after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, is in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the group’s attacks, and Israel’s counterattacks, have been limited to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border. Supported by Iran, Hezbollah has long been seen by Israel as a much more formidable foe than Hamas. The group has an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weapons that includes attack drones and precision guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. What is Hezbollah and will it go to war with Israel?A conflict with Hezbollah would probably involve other Iranian-supported groups in the region, members of what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance” - the Houthis in Yemen or militias in Iraq, for example. Iran, too, has vowed to respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political chief who was killed on Wednesday while visiting Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian president. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel, which has stayed silent. The killing has dealt a blow to the possibility of any success in ongoing talks for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It is the main hope to defuse tensions with Hezbollah, and diplomatic efforts continue to try to de-escalate the situation. The Israeli military has said it is ready for any scenario, as the country braces itself for a possible response to the two assassinations. Nasrallah’s speech contained, as expected, sharp words against Israel but did not appear to suggest that a bigger war was imminent just yet.",Hezbollah leader says conflict with Israel in 'new phase' after killings,Hezbollah leader says conflict with Israel in 'new phase' after killings,"israel,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05v009n2ko,articles/article_3005.txt,results/article_3005.txt.json
3006,2024-09-19 19:44:31.582000+00:00,/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o,"Hezbollah’s leader has said bomb attacks using thousands of the Lebanese armed group's pagers and radios ""crossed all red lines"", and accused Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war. In a much-anticipated speech, Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged Hezbollah had suffered an “unprecedented blow”, but he vowed it would continue fighting and inflict a “just punishment”. Israel has not said it was behind the blasts on Tuesday and Wednesday, which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000. As Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already-exhausted population, and others struck targets in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it was operating to “degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure” and to “bring security to northern Israel”. Eleven months of cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel sparked by the war in Gaza have killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. There were no surprises in Hassan Nasrallah’s televised address on Thursday afternoon - his first public reaction to the exploding device attacks which created panic across Lebanon and raised fears of another major war between Hezbollah and Israel. In what was a humiliating security breach, 12 people were killed, including two children, when pagers used by Hezbollah members to communicate blew up almost simultaneously across the country on Tuesday, according to Lebanon’s health minister. Another 25 were killed when walkie-talkies exploded the next day. Reports citing Lebanese and US sources said Israeli intelligence operatives were likely to have planted small amounts of explosives inside the devices or their batteries. “The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally,” Nasrallah said. “This is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security. It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description. This was the enemy's intention,” he added. The Hezbollah leader acknowledged that this was a massive and unprecedented blow for his group, but he insisted that its ability to command and communicate remained intact. Nasrallah’s tone was defiant and he vowed a harsh punishment. But, again, he indicated that Hezbollah was not interested in an escalation of its current conflict with Israel. The group’s cross-border attacks, he said, were going to continue unless there was a ceasefire in Gaza, and that no killings or assassinations would return residents to northern Israel. Shortly before the speech, crowds of Hezbollah supporters gathered in the capital’s southern suburbs to bury two members killed on Tuesday. Some people said they had been shaken by the explosions, but that they were determined to resist. On Thursday morning, Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon fired two anti-tank missiles across the border, followed by drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third seriously wounded. The latest exchanges come at a time when Israel says its military focus has shifted away from Gaza to the situation in the north. The IDF said on Thursday that its chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, had “recently completed approval of plans for the northern arena”. Later, at a meeting of military and intelligence chiefs, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. ”“Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” he added. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price. ”It is not clear how Israel intends to achieve this goal. But reports earlier this week suggested that the general in charge of the IDF’s Northern Command favoured the creation of an Israeli-controlled buffer zone inside southern Lebanon. In his speech, Hassan Nasrallah called the general a fool and said that any such move would have dire consequences for Israel.",Hezbollah leader says exploding device attacks crossed 'all red lines',Hezbollah leader says exploding device attacks crossed 'all red lines',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o,articles/article_3006.txt,results/article_3006.txt.json

A strike hit the headquarters of the Baath political party in the densely populated Ras al-Naba neighbourhood on Sunday, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency. The country's health ministry said four people were killed, but did not name the victims. Afif, one of the few remaining public faces of the group, was last seen on Monday, when he gave a press conference in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group is based.  Hezbollah confirmed the death on Sunday evening, several hours after it was first reported. Most of the headquarters of the Lebanese branch of the Syrian Baath party was destroyed in the strike, as rescue and civil defence teams rushed to aid a number of people trapped under the rubble, the National News Agency reported. The health ministry said 14 people were injured as well as the four killed. The Lebanese Baath Party is a branch of the Syrian Baath Party, headed by President Bashar Al-Assad, and a long-time Hezbollah ally. Its Lebanese headquarters are located by a busy central intersection connecting western and eastern Beirut with the city centre and the airport road, which passes through the southern suburbs. BBC Middle East correspondent Lina Sinjab said the development raised concern that Israel was expanding attacks beyond Hezbollah military officials. Hezbollah is also a political party with representatives in parliament and ministers in government. “That is really sending alarm to people, that there are no signs of de-escalating this situation or finding a solution, but rather further escalation and widening Israeli targets against Hezbollah in Lebanon,"" she told BBC's news channel. Later on Sunday, another strike in central Beirut on Mar Elias Street killed two people and wounded 13 more, the Lebanese health ministry said. The BBC has reached out to the IDF about the second strike in central Beirut. Earlier on Sunday, the IDF said it had conducted strikes on six Hezbollah military targets in the southern suburbs. In the past week, the Israeli military has intensified its attacks on Beirut, amid renewed efforts led by the US for a ceasefire in the war. Israel already killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top commanders and senior officials in Beirut strikes in late September, when Israel launched an offensive against the Iran-backed group. Israel said it wanted to return tens of thousands of displaced residents to the country's north nearly a year after Hezbollah stepped up rocket attacks in support of Palestinians after Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including at least 2,600 since Israel launched a intense air campaign followed by a ground invasion in the south in late September, according to the Lebanese health ministry.

One former Israeli intelligence official I contacted explained his reluctance to comment with a saying from the Talmud: “And at this very time the smart ones keep silent. ”Given the astonishingly audacious scope of yesterday’s attack, it seems it was designed to cause massive physical, psychological and technical damage to one of Israel’s most formidable opponents. But reports from Lebanon suggest that Israel may not have intended to use this doomsday weapon just now. The “shock and awe” engendered by such an attack was probably being held in reserve for a moment of maximum need: either when Israel was about to launch a major assault on Lebanon or when it felt Hezbollah might be about to act first. Neither of these appear to be the case, lending credence to reports that Israel triggered the explosive pagers because it believed its plot had been, or was in the process of being uncovered. Whatever the truth of the matter, the episode comes at a time when Israel is taking action, overt and covert, to address the threat posed by Hezbollah and its reputed arsenal of 150,000 precision-guided missiles and rockets. Away from the daily air-strikes on Hezbollah targets, each documented for the media by the Israeli military, a murky shadow war is raging. Ten days ago, Israeli special forces mounted an audacious raid against an Iranian-built military facility in Syria, where it’s believed ballistic missiles were being developed. Commandos rappelled from helicopters, planted explosives inside the underground facility and removed sensitive information. Some reports suggested they even captured individuals, possibly Iranian, working there. Six weeks earlier, Israel assassinated Fuad Shukr, one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders. A report in the Wall Street Journal said that just before the attack, Shukr received a message asking him to go to his seventh floor apartment, where he was easier to hit. Hezbollah furiously denied the report, but as yesterday’s dramatic events proved, Hezbollah’s networks – their supply chains and communications – appear to be badly compromised. The Iranian-backed group is, of course, doing its utmost to fight back, firing rockets across Israel’s northern border and, occasionally, trying its own covert operations. On Tuesday morning, Israel said it had foiled an attempt to assassinate a former Israeli security official using a remotely-activated explosive device. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate for Tuesday's mass attack. Given the physical mutilation wrought on huge numbers of its members and the militia’s urgent need to identify and deal with this catastrophic security breach, revenge may have to wait – but it is surely bound to come. Which brings us to a fundamental question: what, if anything, has really changed? Israel’s war with Hezbollah, overt and covert, goes on. Israel’s newly declared war aim – bringing displaced citizens back to evacuated communities along the northern border – has not been advanced. Despite a lot of heated speculation here in Israel, the military does not appear to be poised to invade southern Lebanon. That may eventually happen. Israelis are thoroughly fed up with almost a year of insecurity in the north. But Israel is still fighting in Gaza - the death of four more soldiers was announced on Tuesday - and the prospect of another major ground operation is not universally welcome. An opinion poll by Channel 13 News found that 52% of Israelis favoured a “broad scale war in Lebanon,” with 30% against and 18% undecided. For all Israel’s displays of tactical ingenuity, when it comes to dealing with Hezbollah, it’s hard to see exactly where this simmering conflict is heading next.",Hezbollah pager explosions highlight shadow war,Hezbollah pager explosions highlight shadow war,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg3lm436jlo,articles/article_3008.txt,results/article_3008.txt.json

A spokesman for Haifa's municipality said it was the first time the city had been targeted since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it was investigating how its air defences failed to intercept the rockets. Hezbollah said it targeted a military base south of Haifa. Another person was injured when a barrage of rockets hit the town of Tiberias, which is located to the east on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes carried out a new round of air strikes in the Lebanese capital. Beirut, hitting what the military said were Hezbollah targets. The military also said a third division had joined its invasion of southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said its fighters were targeting Israeli troops in and around border villages. Israel’s government has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Hezbollah has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, insisting on Monday that it was confident in its ability to “repel the [Israeli] aggression”. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Hezbollah fired more than 135 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday. Approximately five projectiles crossed from Lebanon after air raid sirens sounded in the Carmel and Bay areas of Haifa at 23:22 local time (20:22 GMT), an IDF statement said. “Interceptors were fired. Fallen projectiles were identified in the area. The incident is under review,” it added. Eliran Tal, spokesman for the Haifa municipality, told the BBC that two neighbourhoods were hit. BBC Verify geolocated CCTV footage showing the moment that one of the rockets hit a roundabout, external near a supermarket and several apartment blocks in the west of the city. In another video, emergency services and bystanders are seen inspecting a crater and piles of rubble and earth, external at the scene. Tal Rosen, a member of the emergency services, told Reuters news agency that he had been inside his home about 500m (1,640ft) away when he heard an explosion. “In the beginning, we didn't find any injuries and then I saw in this building,” he said, pointing to damaged windows on the side of a nearby apartment block. “There were shards of glass in this building. I went inside and I found four people [with] minor to moderate [injuries]. ""Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said it treated a 13-year-old boy in a moderate condition with shrapnel injuries to his head, as well as a 22-year-old man in a moderate condition with both a blast injury and a head injury from falling through a window. Hezbollah said it launched ""a salvo of Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa” late on Sunday in retaliation for the Israeli air strike that killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah last month. Mr Tal dismissed Hezbollah's claim,  saying it was ""an attack on civilian population"". He estimated that 95% of Haifa's population of 280,000 was staying put. ""With missile threats from the north, it is not an easy period of time. But we are strong,"" he said. ""We went through a lot of tragedy like this - and I hope the IDF and the leadership will do their best to push the enemy far from the border. ""The MDA also reported that a man in his 20s was in a serious but stable condition and suffering from shrapnel injuries to his chest and abdomen following a separate rocket attack on the town of Tiberias, about 50km (30 miles) to the east.

Speaking in a televised speech to mark one week since Fuad Shukr’s killing, Hassan Nasrallah said the retaliation would be “strong” and “effective”, and that the assassination could not be treated as an ordinary attack. He added that the group might act alone or in co-ordination with other Iranian-supported factions in the region. Countries around the world have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon in recent days, amid concerns that a possible attack from the heavily armed Hezbollah on Israel could lead to a wider war between the two sides. Iran has also vowed to retaliate following the assassination of the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last week. Both Hamas and Iran blame Israel, which has not commented. On Tuesday afternoon, low-flying Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier above Beirut, in the minutes before Nasrallah was due to begin his speech. Nasrallah, who spoke for more than an hour and a half, said that the sonic booms were intended to provoke those who had gathered to listen to him. Earlier on Tuesday, Israel said it had carried out an air strike against what it said was a ""military structure"" used by Hezbollah, the militia and political movement, in southern Lebanon. Four people were killed in the strike on a house in the town of Maifadoun, around 19 miles (30km) from the Israeli border, the Lebanese health ministry said. The four men were Hezbollah fighters, security sources told the AFP news agency. In an apparent response, the group launched drone strikes on towns in northern Israel, injuring two people. Several countries, including the US, have urged citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. The country's foreign minister said on Tuesday that he was working to ensure that Hezbollah did not trigger a major escalation with its response to Shukr's death. The Israeli attack on Maifadoun was carried out by fighter jets, and was guided by intelligence agencies, the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement posted to social media. Officers from the internal security agency Shin Bet and military intelligence agency Aman provided assistance to the military. In response, Hezbollah fired what it called a ""swarm"" of drones at Israel, injuring two people in the northern town of Mazra’a. But a source in the group told the Reuters news agency that the attack was not part of its response to the death of Shukr. US President Joe Biden met his senior national security team on Monday as concerns of a retaliatory attack on Israel grew. Mr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel, should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working ""around the clock"" to prevent an escalation. The United Nations' rights chief Volker Turk called on ""all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation"". Elsewhere,  several US military personnel have been injured  in a strike on a base in Iraq.

3012,2024-07-29 16:53:44.785000+00:00,/news/articles/c29dwgp3rr7o,"A deadly strike on a playing field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has sharply escalated fears of a new war in the region. Israel says the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group was behind the attack, though the group has denied this. On the evening of Saturday 27 July, a blast hit a playing field in the town of Majdal Shams, killing 12 children and young people from the minority Druze community. It was the deadliest incident in or around Israel's border with Lebanon since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. The strike, with its young victims, caused outrage and shock in Israel and around the world. Israel says Hezbollah carried out the attack with an Iranian-made rocket, fired from a short distance away in Lebanon. The US also says Hezbollah was to blame. Hezbollah has strongly denied involvement. Hezbollah is a heavily armed militant and political movement based in Lebanon - Israel's northern neighbour. Its military wing is one of the most powerful forces in the region, equipped with up to 200,000 missiles and rockets, as well as attack drones. It is separate to the Lebanese army, and is much stronger. Hezbollah is also politically influential in the Lebanese government.  The movement follows the Shia branch of Islam and is financed, equipped and trained by Iran, the dominant Shia power in the Middle East. Hezbollah and its supporters consider it a legitimate resistance movement against Israel, which it claims still occupies part of Lebanese territory. Hezbollah is a strong supporter of Hamas and the Palestinians and rejects Israel's right to exist. The movement is banned as a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab LeagueBowen: Golan attack leaves border war's unspoken rules in tattersWill Hezbollah go to war with Israel?Thousands mourn children killed in Golan Heights strike The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-west Syria, extending towards north-east Israel. In the 1967 Middle East war, Israel captured about 1,200 km sq (about 460 square miles) of the Golan Heights, from which Syria had attacked it. Israel annexed the area in 1981, in a move which has not been recognised by the vast majority of the international community. The Trump administration broke with decades of US policy by recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights in 2019. Syria says the land has always belonged to it and has vowed to recover the territory, while Israel says the heights are crucial for its defence and will remain in its hands forever. About 20,000 Jewish settlers live on the Golan Heights, which is also home to Israeli military bases and listening posts. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Druze people are an Arabic-speaking ethnic and religious group who mostly live in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria. Part of the community has lived on the Golan Heights for centuries. Those on the Golan Heights went from Syrian to Israeli rule in June 1967, when Israel occupied most of it. Majdal Shams is the largest of four Druze-majority towns there. Israel offered citizenship to all of the Golan Height's residents, though many chose to retain their allegiance to Syria. About 20% of the approximately 21,000 Druze who live there today have accepted or inherited Israeli citizenship. Those who have kept Syrian citizenship also have Israeli residency status, with most of the same rights as Israeli nationals apart from the right to vote. Beyond the occupied Golan Heights, there about about 110,000 Druze who are full Israeli citizens. They are the largest non-Jewish community which serves in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), as part of the country's mandatory national service. There are about a million Druze in the world, though estimates vary. Their faith is an offshoot of a branch of Shia Islam but theirs is a distinct religion with its own set of practices and beliefs. Hezbollah fired at Israeli targets the day after Israel was attacked by Hamas in the south on 7 October. Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then, the two sides have exchanged fire on a regular basis, forcing thousands of people in Lebanon and Israel from their homes. Israeli security officials say the rocket which killed the youngsters was part of a barrage which struck several locations on the occupied Golan Heights. That followed an Israeli strike that killed four Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon. Most Hezbollah attacks since 8 October have hit northern Israel, with fewer strikes  on the Golan Heights. It has, though, repeatedly targeted Israeli military positions on part of the Golan Heights called the Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov, just a few miles from Majdal Shams. Hezbollah may have calculated that the international reaction to attacking an area considered to be under Israeli occupation would be relatively muted, while keeping up pressure on the Israeli government and military as they fight a war in Gaza.  Hezbollah supports Hamas, which has been at war with Israel since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Hezbollah opened up a limited second front in Israel's north the next day and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran (although Hamas is a Sunni Muslim group and Hezbollah is Shia). Both are part of what Iran calls an ""axis of resistance"", a loose alliance of like-minded, Iran-backed groups across the Middle East, acting against Israel and Israel's key ally, the US, in the region. Hezbollah has not got directly involved in the war in Gaza and has said it will stop firing at Israel if and when there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.","Hezbollah, Israel and the Golan Heights: What is happening and why?","Hezbollah, Israel and the Golan Heights: What is happening and why?","israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c29dwgp3rr7o,articles/article_3012.txt,results/article_3012.txt.json
3013,2024-08-15 12:33:23.744000+00:00,/news/articles/cjw32jj4973o,"The US says there has been a “promising start” to the new round of talks in Doha on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Gaza Strip, as the number of Palestinians reported killed in the war between Israel and Hamas surpassed 40,000. An agreement is seen as key to stopping the 10-month conflict spiralling into an all-out regional war involving Iran, but expectations of a breakthrough are low. White House spokesman John Kirby said “there remains a lot of work to do” to resolve gaps in the implementation of the framework agreement. Hamas has said it will not participate in the indirect negotiations in Doha for now, although mediators are said to be relaying messages to the armed group’s officials based there. It has called for a roadmap based on a proposal outlined by the US president and has accused Israel's prime minister of adding new conditions, which he has denied. Israeli media report that the country’s negotiating team has been given a slightly expanded mandate, while the relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are calling this the “last chance” to get some of them out alive. The mediators face a number of potential sticking points, including control of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt and the return of displaced Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza. The talks were suspended after Hamas's political leader and chief negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran at the end of July. Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, raising fears of a wider escalation. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday that at least 40,005 people had been killed in the territory since then, which the UN human rights chief described as a “grim milestone for the world”. The figure, which does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, is often disputed by the Israeli government but is broadly accepted by UN agencies. The Israeli military said it had “eliminated over 17,000 terrorists”. It has also reported that 330 of its troops have been killed since the ground invasion began. Israel's delegation to the Doha talks reportedly included the directors of its Mossad foreign intelligence agency and Shin Bet domestic security service, David Barnier and Ronen Bar, as well as the Israeli military’s hostages chief, Nitzan Alon. CIA director William Burns joined them, along with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel. Qatari and Egyptian officials were also “mediating with Hamas” as part of the process, according to the US state department. After the start of the discussions on Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that they were likely to continue on Friday because of the complexity of the agreement. Mr Kirby stressed that they were not having a debate over the broad framework of the deal. “We're at a point where it's generally accepted. Where the gaps are in the execution of the deal, the individual muscle-movements that go with putting the deal in place,"" he explained, without providing any details. He added: “The remaining obstacles can be overcome, and we must bring this process to a close. ” The first phase of the proposed deal outlined by US President Joe Biden at the end of May would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remainsA senior official in Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - told the BBC on Wednesday that it would not attend the Doha talks, even though its political leadership is almost entirely based in the Qatari capital. He claimed that Israel had “added new conditions and reneged on its previous agreement”, including demanding that it maintain full control over the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and that displaced people returning to northern Gaza be screened to ensure they are unarmed civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement on Tuesday saying the claim that he had added new conditions was “false”, describing them instead as “essential clarifications to help implement” the initial proposal. ""Enough is enough, we want to get back to our homes in Gaza City. Every hour, a family is getting killed or a house getting bombed,"" Aya, a displaced Palestinian woman sheltering in Deir al-Balah, told Reuters news agency. ""We are hopeful this time. Either it's this time or never I am afraid. ”The families of the remaining Israeli hostages also believe time is running out, and many took part in a march through Tel Aviv at which they chanted “seal the deal”. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held by Hamas, 39 of whom are presumed dead. It came as the spokesman of Hamas’s military wing released a statement providing further details about how he said an Israeli male hostage had been shot and killed by a Hamas guard. Abu Ubaida said the guard had “acted in a retaliatory manner, against instructions, after he received information that his two children were martyred” by Israeli forces. The Israeli military said in response to the group’s initial statement about the killing on Monday that it did not have any information that allowed it to confirm or deny the claim. Hamas also posted on Thursday a photo showing the body of another man, who it said had been killed in “an unfortunate incident”. The Israeli military said the image showed “a hostage who was murdered and whose body was recovered” by troops in November. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum identified him as Ofir Tzarfati and cited his mother, Richelle, as saying: ""What is important is that the delegation succeeds and does everything to come back with a deal. Everyone needs to come home, now. ”In addition to halting a war and freeing hostages, the US and others see a ceasefire deal as a way to deter Iran from retaliating against Israel for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, who has been succeeded by Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the 7 October attack. The Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement has also vowed to respond to the killing of a senior commander in an Israeli air strike in Beirut. The Israeli military blamed the latter for a rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel has warned Iran that it would “exact a heavy price for any aggression”, while Iran has insisted “a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right”. Mr Kirby said the US and its allies  had to take seriously the “rhetoric coming out of Tehran”. “I can't sit here and tell you for sure that that there's been a decision to change their mind,” he said. “A few days ago, we had information. . . that an attack could come with little or no warning, and certainly could come in coming days, and we have to be ready for it. ”",High-stakes Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks resume in Doha,High-stakes Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks resume in Doha,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjw32jj4973o,articles/article_3013.txt,results/article_3013.txt.json

Steve Brisley's sister, Lianne Sharabi, nieces Noiya, 16, Yahel, 13, and their family dog were murdered on 7 October last year, when Hamas launched a series of cross-border attacks from the Gaza Strip on southern Israel.

3015,2024-10-09 18:27:18.534000+00:00,/news/articles/c9vplm00pm0o,"Amid gunfire and Israeli artillery shelling, Palestinian medics say that they have begun moving premature babies and other patients away from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia refugee camp, as troops and tanks encircle it. The Israeli military has been carrying out its third ground offensive in the area since the war in Gaza began, saying it is targeting regrouping Hamas fighters who aim to launch attacks. Two other local hospitals are virtually inaccessible and face evacuation orders, Gazan health officials say. Dozens of people are reported to have been killed and wounded in the north in recent days. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said on Monday that its first responders had recovered the bodies of 15 people following an Israeli strike on a tented camp for displaced people next to the al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had ""struck terrorists operating within a command-and-control centre embedded in an area in Jabalia that previously served as a medical compound"", and that it had taken steps to mitigate harm to civilians. The Civil Defence also said five people were killed in a strike on a family home in the camp, which had more than 110,000 registered residents before the war. Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned that its own shelters and services were being forced to shut. “With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading and deepening again,” Philippe Lazzarini said, adding that the second phase of the polio vaccination campaign for children in Gaza was also threatened. Residents have been speaking to the BBC about their fear and desperation. “I have been displaced more than 10 times. I’ve moved from house to house, from school to school, under shelling, and from street to street,” said Ahmed Leki, a 50-year-old father from the Falluja area of Jabalia. ""We are exhausted, completely worn out. There's nothing left. Where can we go? We have small children, and there's no safe place in Gaza, not a single safe inch,” he added. “We left our homes with shells raining down on us, with bombing, destruction, and dismemberment all around us. Enough is enough. ""In recent days, new evacuation orders have been issued by the Israeli military covering a wide area in the north of the enclave, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and parts of Gaza City. All those remaining in the north - estimated at 400,000 people - have been told to head to the south. “Displacement is extremely difficult, a tragedy. There is no transportation, no necessities for survival. Men, women, and children ask, ‘Where do we go?’ and the answer is, ‘I don’t know,’” said Bilal al-Amreeti, a local man. “The sound of Israeli warplanes is above us, there is bombing, and the shelling continues everywhere. ”Despite Israel’s assurances, many Gazans fear that it aims to depopulate the north of the strip and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement.",Hospitals move patients as Israeli tanks encircle Jabalia camp,Hospitals move patients as Israeli tanks encircle Jabalia camp,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vplm00pm0o,articles/article_3015.txt,results/article_3015.txt.json
3016,2024-07-25 13:58:22.160000+00:00,/news/articles/cg3ep0wll7qo,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech was hailed as historic, powerful and moving by his supporters in Israel and derided as absurd and cynical by some of his critics. Much of the nation is focused on the need to end the war in Gaza and bring home the hostages held by Hamas. Instead, the Israeli prime minister delivered a fiery defence of Israel’s military campaign, framing it as a proxy fight against Iran that must be won at all costs. “You placed the truth on the most important stage in the world,” tweeted Aryeh Deri, the head of Shas, which is part of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition government. “His words represent every Israeli who wants to live in security and believes in the righteousness of Israel's fight for existence,” was the reaction of Israel Katz, the foreign minister. “Netanyahu gave an excellent speech,” wrote columnist Shai Peron, who identifies as a religious Zionist, on the Ynet news website. “He didn't give a pass to the world, to academia, to fake wokeness. He clarified to the world this is a war between light and darkness. He reminded everyone that it is ‘us first, you later. ’""It’s the hostages in Gaza who are the first priority for their families and friends. A former hostage and some family members travelled with Mr Netanyahu and joined the audience in the chamber, but many demonstrated against him in Washington. Thousands of miles away in central Tel Aviv, the families and friends of those held captive gathered to watch the speech, delivered in English, projected onto a screen with Hebrew subtitles. While it was playing, relatives of some who had died in Gaza took to a stage to berate the prime minister with cries of anguish - a jarring contrast to the standing ovations they were seeing in Congress. “I’m again and again shocked because it’s unbelievable the level of absurdity and cynicism and hypocrisy,” said Noa Golan, who was in the crowd. “It’s surreal being here, [it's] so clear and obvious what needs to be done, and seeing him there. Lying would be a good way to describe it. ”Her friend Ruth Bar-Shalom said she hadn’t really expected an announcement of a deal to free the hostages, but she had expected Congress to be “much wiser and to demand answers from him"". “He’s using everyone and everything, including the American Congress which is too ignorant to see the difference between a lie and the truth, between reality and the movie he’s showing them again and again and they believe,"" she said. ""It’s unbelievable, we’re standing here helpless. We see that, and we cannot believe that this could happen in these days. ”Although Mr Netanyahu said Israel was intensely engaged in efforts to free the hostages, he made no mention of the ceasefire agreement under negotiation. He also postponed the departure of the Israeli delegation to the next round of talks in Qatar. Israeli officials said he wanted to first coordinate positions with US President Joe Biden. But the move reinforced a widespread conviction that the prime minister is delaying a deal to appease the ultra-right nationalists in his government. Families of the hostages responded by demanding an urgent meeting with the negotiators, accusing him of deliberately sabotaging their chances of bringing their loved ones home. Mr Netanyahu also made almost no mention of the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Israel’s sweeping military operations. And he angrily dismissed accusations by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) that he was starving Gaza. He said Israel had let half a million tons of food into the Strip, and blamed Hamas for stealing it. The prime minister was “repeating the degrading propaganda and lies that he spread over the past nine months,” Hamas said in response to the speech. “It would have been better to arrest Netanyahu as a war criminal and hand him to the International Criminal Court instead of giving him an opportunity to… cover up the mass killings and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,” it said in a statement, accusing Washington of giving Mr Netanyahu cover to “escape punishment"". Ahmad Majdalani, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) executive committee, denounced Mr Netanyahu’s description of the Gaza conflict as a civilizational war, “as if destroying the Gaza Strip… was a civilizational matter"". In an interview with Voice of Palestine, he said the applause in Congress for “every word” Mr Netanyahu uttered showed the US was a true partner in the war. “Netanyahu knows how to talk,” wrote Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper, “especially in English, in which his eloquence is infinitely more impressive than that of all his domestic rivals. ”He said the prime minister was correct about Hamas atrocities and “inconceivable support for the massacre” on some American campuses. “But there is little weight behind these words as long as the prime minister doesn't take responsibility for the Israeli failure on October 7, is in no hurry to bring the hostages home, and has refused for months to move forward on a detailed practical plan for the 'day after' the war in Gaza. ”",Hostage families deride Netanyahu's Congress speech,Hostage families deride Netanyahu's Congress speech,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3ep0wll7qo,articles/article_3016.txt,results/article_3016.txt.json
3017,2024-09-03 00:53:44.756000+00:00,/news/articles/c20l22jnj6go,"Through the street outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house passed a slow procession of empty coffins - carried by protesters in a sea of Israeli flags. Since six Israeli hostages were found dead in a Gaza tunnel last weekend, the weight of the war there has hung heavier on Israel’s leader. Israel said Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino were shot and killed by Hamas shortly before Israeli troops made the discovery. “I think the fact that they were alive and murdered right before they could have been saved – that broke it,” said Anna Rubin, who joined a protest in Tel Aviv. “That’s a breaking point for a lot of people – [they] are on the edge of their seat, and they realise that sitting at home is not going to do anything. ” Tens of thousands of people took to the streets again on Monday, after mass demonstrations flooded Tel Aviv last night. Many want to see this moment as a turning point, but Prime Minister Netanyahu has been here before. He’s lived through months of these street protests – and years of similar ones.  Protected by a parliamentary majority, his strategy has largely been to ignore their demands. But then, if Mr Netanyahu isn’t listening, many people in Israel are not protesting. A one-day general strike, called by the country’s labour union, was very patchily observed – even in Tel Aviv, the country’s beach-side liberal heartland. Shops and restaurants in the city centre were mostly open, after briefly closing in solidarity with the protest on Sunday night. “I don’t agree with the decision,” one of the staff at local cafe told me. “We should have closed. ”Tamara was picking up a street scooter, in large shades and perfect lipstick. “I don’t agree with the strike,” she said. “We want the hostages back – but we can’t stop everything; we need to live. ”Twenty-three-year-old Niva said she was surprised to see so many places open.  “The country is in a very confrontational mood now,” she said. But the most striking confrontation isn’t happening in the streets. In a live press conference on Monday night, Mr Netanyahu defied anyone to demand more concessions from Israel in its negotiations over a hostage and ceasefire deal, brokered by the US. ""These murderers executed six of our hostages; they shot them in the back of the head,” he said. “And now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions?”The message that would send to Hamas, he said, would be: “kill more hostages [and] you’ll get more concessions. ” He said no-one who was serious about achieving peace and freeing the hostages – including US President Joe Biden – would ask him to make more concessions. A short while earlier, Mr Biden, when asked by reporters, said he didn’t think Israel’s prime minister was doing enough to secure a ceasefire deal. A key demand of Hamas is that Israel withdraws all its forces from a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Israel’s security chiefs, including the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, have been widely reported in local media as supporting alternatives to keeping troops on the ground. Mr Gallant has publicly pressed the cabinet to back a proposed compromise. The most dangerous moment of Israel’s previous mass protests, sparked by Mr Netanyahu’s judicial reform plans, was when he tried to sack Mr Gallant – and was then forced to reinstate him. If he tried that again, says political analyst Tamar Hermann of Israel’s Democracy Institute, that could be the real turning point for protests here. The threat to him from demonstrators now, she says, is “zero”. Most are left-leaning critics whose opposition to the prime minister runs far deeper than the hostage crisis in Gaza. “Netanyahu knows better than I do,” she said, “the best thing is to let it play as a safety valve – let people say, ‘we hate you, you are a murderer’. ”Prime Minister Netanyahu, protected by his parliamentary majority, seems to believe he can ride out the demands for a deal being made from the street, at least for now. But the demands from his own defence minister, from the US president, could prove harder to ignore.",Hostage killings leave Israeli protesters at 'breaking point',Hostage killings leave Israeli protesters at 'breaking point',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20l22jnj6go,articles/article_3017.txt,results/article_3017.txt.json
3019,2024-09-30 18:35:42.651000+00:00,/news/articles/cj9jwkppnd1o,"Israel says it has launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah, marking another significant escalation of their long-running conflict that has heightened fears of a regional war. The Israeli military said troops were carrying out “limited” raids in villages near the border, as aircraft continued to conduct intense air strikes throughout Lebanon. It follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against the Iran-backed Shia Islamist military and political organisation, including the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas who have been displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Although Hezbollah has been weakened, it remains defiant. The group is continuing to fire barrages of rockets into northern Israel and has said it is ready for the next battle. Here’s what we know about the latest developments. BBC Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega in Beirut says Lebanon woke up to the news that Israel had launched a ground operation in the south - something that felt almost inevitable in the last few days. The fear is that this could be the beginning of a wider campaign against Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war war with Israel in 2006. In a brief statement put out early on Tuesday, the Israeli military announced that troops backed by aircraft and artillery had begun “limited, localised and targeted raids against Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages, saying they posed an “immediate threat” to northern Israeli communities. According to BBC Middle East Correspondent Lucy Williamson in northern Israel, helicopters and jets flew low across this border overnight, to the regular crump of artillery and occasional loud explosions. And by the morning, fields a few miles from the border that had been full of dozens of tanks were emptying. The military did not say how many troops were involved or how far it was preparing to push into Lebanese territory. However, a senior security official told the BBC that this was “not numbers of a large ground invasion” and that the troops had so far only gone as far as “very close walking distance”. But sending ground troops even a short distance into Lebanon carries significant risks. Hezbollah, which is well armed with anti-tank missiles and mines, has been preparing to meet Israeli forces on that terrain for years.

But he added that the group was “ready for a direct confrontation with the enemy forces that dare or attempt to enter Lebanese territory and to inflict the greatest losses on them”. Hezbollah also fired more rockets and missiles into Israel - attacks that Mr Afif said were “only the beginning” of its response to Israel’s attacks. Sirens sounded several times in the border town of Metula, where Hezbollah said its fighters had targeted Israeli troops with artillery and rocket fire without mentioning any incursion. The group also claimed it had fired missiles towards two Israeli intelligence bases in the central Tel Aviv area. Paramedics said two people were injured on a highway near Kafr Qasim. Israel has inflicted huge damage on Hezbollah in recent weeks, killing more than a dozen top commanders and apparently destroying thousands of weapons in air strikes. It was also blamed for the exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that left thousands of Hezbollah members maimed, blinded or killed. However, BBC International Editor Jeremy Bowen says the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday is the biggest blow of all. For more than 30 years, he was the beating heart of Hezbollah. With the help of Iranian funding, training and weapons, he turned it into a military force whose attacks led Israel to end a 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and which fought Israel to a standstill during a month-long war in 2006. For Israel, Nasrallah’s killing is a huge victory. In a defiant speech at the UN on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that Israel was “winning” the war against enemies who wanted to destroy it. By then, he had authorised the strike that killed Nasrallah. Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned on Tuesday that Lebanon was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases of its history"". He said about a million people - a fifth of the population - had fled their homes “because of the devastating war that Israel is waging on Lebanon”. The Lebanese health ministry said more than 1,200 people had also been killed, including dozens of children and women, over the past two weeks. Authorities are struggling to assist everyone, with shelters and hospitals under pressure. Israel says it is hitting Hezbollah sites, including weapons stores and ammunition dumps, and accused the group of using civilians as human shields. But BBC senior international correspondent Orla Guerin says that is disputed by residents of the central Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been bombed repeatedly in the past week. The medical director of the local Rayaq hospital also told her that all of the casualties it had treated had been civilians. Young Lebanese girl left fighting for life after Israeli strikes'I grabbed my grandchildren and ran': Lebanon families flee Israeli strikesWho was Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah?What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon? US President Joe Biden welcomed Hassan Nasrallah’s killing. And after the Israeli incursion began, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin released a statement saying he agreed with Israel on the “necessity of dismantling [Hezbollah] attack infrastructure along the border”. However, Mr Austin also reiterated that “diplomatic resolution is required” to ensure the safety of civilians “on both sides of the border”. BBC state department correspondent Tom Bateman says the Israeli decision to escalate sharply the conflict with Hezbollah struck a potentially fatal blow to US President Joe Biden’s entire strategy of the last 11 months - to try to stop the war in Gaza engulfing the region. Biden has said he is boosting the US defensive posture in the Middle East, while the Pentagon has warned Iran-backed militias not to try to use this moment to attack US bases. Despite the earlier US attempts to rein in the Israeli leader and coax Hezbollah to a truce, Netanyahu has signalled strongly that he will act as he sees fit, whatever the pressure from Washington. Can diplomacy bring Middle East ceasefire? Early signs don't bode well Hezbollah still has thousands of fighters, many of them veterans of combat in neighbouring Syria’s civil war, as well as a substantial arsenal of missiles, many of them long-range, precision-guided missiles that could reach Tel Aviv and other cities. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says there will be pressure within its ranks to use those missiles before they get destroyed, but a mass attack on Israel that kills civilians could trigger a devastating response. The assassination of Nasrallah was also a huge blow to Iran, hitting at the heart of the regional network of allied, heavily armed militias known as the “Axis of Resistance” that is key to its deterrent strategy against Israel. On Sunday, Israeli jets struck infrastructure in Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hudaydah in response to recent missile and drone attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi movement. Iran could ask the Houthis and other groups to step up their attacks on both Israel and US bases in the region. But whatever response it chooses, it will likely calibrate it to be just short of triggering a regional war that would draw in the US and which it could not win.

3020,2024-10-31 06:25:47.366000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2yv9k3mpmo,"Last time Donald Trump was president, Israel’s prime minister was so pleased, he named a community after him. Trump Heights is an isolated cluster of pre-fabricated houses in the rocky, mine-strewn landscape of the Golan Heights, a soaring eagle-and-menorah statue guarding the entrance gate.  Mauve mountain peaks jut into the azure sky at the horizon. This was Trump’s reward for upending half a century of US policy – and wide international consensus – by recognising Israel’s territorial claims to the Golan, captured from Syria in the 1967 war, and later unilaterally annexed. The question for residents there – two dozen families and a few billeted soldiers – is what impact Republican candidate Trump or his Democratic rival Kamala Harris might have on Israel’s interests in the region now. Elik Goldberg and his wife Hodaya moved to Trump Heights with their four children for the security of a small rural community. Since the 7 October Hamas attacks in southern Israel last year, they’ve watched Israel’s war with Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, escalate along the northern border with Lebanon, 10 miles away from them. “For the last year, our beautiful green open space has a lot of smoke, and our lovely view is a view of rockets that Hezbollah is sending to us,” said Elik.  “This is a war zone and we don’t know when it will end. ”Election polls - is Harris or Trump winning?How the election could change the worldElik tells me he wants the new US administration to “do the right thing”.  When I ask what that means, he replies, “support Israel”. “Support the good guys, and have the common sense of right and wrong,” he says. It’s the kind of language you hear a lot in Israel. It’s also the kind of language Trump understands. He won favour with Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, during his last stint as US president by scrapping an Iran nuclear deal that Israel opposed, brokering historic normalisation agreements with several Arab countries, and recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital – countering decades of US policy. Mr Netanyahu once called him “the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House”. As America prepares to vote, the Israeli leader has not hidden his appreciation for the Republican candidate - and polls suggest he’s not alone. Around two-thirds of Israelis would prefer to see Trump back in the White House, according to recent surveys. Less than 20% appear to want Kamala Harris to win. According to one poll, that drops to just 1% among Mr Netanyahu’s own supporters. Gili Shmuelevits, 24, shopping in Jerusalem’s Machane Yehuda market, said Ms Harris “showed her true colours” when she appeared to agree with a protester at a rally who accused Israel of genocide. The vice-president said “what he’s talking about, it’s real”. She later clarified that she did not believe Israel was committing genocide. Rivka, shopping nearby, said she was “100% for Donald Trump”. “He cares more for Israel. He's stronger against our enemies, and he's not scared,” she said. “I get that people don’t love him, but I don’t need to love him. I need him to be a good ally for Israel. ” For many people here, good allies never pressure, criticise or constrain. The war in Gaza has helped drive a wedge between Israel and its US ally. Harris has been more outspoken in calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has put more emphasis on humanitarian issues. After meeting Netanyahu at the White House in July, she said she would “not be silent” about the situation in Gaza and said she had expressed to him her “serious concern about the scale of human suffering” and the deaths of innocent civilians. Mr Trump has framed ending the war in terms of Israel’s “victory”, and has opposed an immediate ceasefire in the past, reportedly telling Netanyahu “do what you have to do”. But many Palestinians see little hope in either candidate. “The overall estimation is that the Democrats are bad, but if Trump is elected it’ll be even worse,” said Mustafa Barghouti, a respected Palestinian analyst and politician in the occupied West Bank. “The main difference is that Kamala Harris will be more sensitive to the shift in American public opinion, and that means more in favour of a ceasefire. ”The Gaza War has increased pressure from US allies like Saudi Arabia for progress towards a Palestinian State. But neither candidate has put the establishment of a Palestinian state at the forefront of their agenda. When Mr Trump was asked during the presidential debates if he would support it, he replied, “I’d have to see”. Many Palestinians have given up the promise of a Palestinian state – and on US support more generally. “The general feeling is that the US has failed drastically in protecting international law, has failed the Palestinians more than once [and] took the side of total bias to Israel,” said Mustafa Barghouti. “The issue of a Palestinian state is nothing but a slogan. ” SIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to knowEXPLAINER: The seven states that will decide the electionECONOMY: Harris and Trump should listen to this mum of sevenKATTY KAY: What's really behind this men v women electionPEOPLE: How much is abortion shaping women's vote?POLLS: Who is winning the race for the White House? On wider regional issues like Iran, the two candidates have historically had different approaches with Trump recently advising Israel to “hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later”. He was speaking before Israel carried out strikes on Iran in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack earlier this month. “Maybe Trump would play more hardball, and the Iranians would be more hesitant if he was president,” said former Israeli ambassador to the US, Danny Ayalon, but he says it is easy to overstate the differences between the two candidates. Both Harris and Trump are now talking about making a new deal to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon, and both want to expand the normalisation agreements between Israel and neighbouring Arab countries – in particular Saudi Arabia. What would be different is their approach. “I think if it’s Kamala Harris [in the White House], the direction will be bottom-up,” said Danny Ayalon, meaning that ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon would come first, before turning to the bigger questions of Iran or new regional alliances. With Trump, he says, “the direction would be top-down - he will go straight to Tehran and from there, try to sort out all the different prongs and theatres throughout the Middle East”. Political insiders in both Israel and the US see Kamala Harris as closer to America’s traditional bipartisan positions on foreign policy in the Middle East – and Donald Trump as unpredictable, reluctant to involve America in foreign conflicts, and prone to ad-hoc deal-making. But Ambassador Ayalon believes it’s not only policy that has an impact on public mood in Israel. “Biden stood by Israel for the entire year,” he said. “But did not get his recognition [because of] things like not inviting him to the White House – things that are more optics than real issues. ”When it comes to US-Israeli relations, he says, public gestures - and emotions - count. “A lot is personal. The [shared] interests are a given, but the personalities matter. ” Between now and the US election on 5 November, BBC correspondents around the world are exploring the impact its outcome could have where they are, and what people around the globe make of this White House race.

3021,2024-10-02 15:03:18.001000+00:00,/news/articles/ckg9k5l19njo,"The Middle East is once again on the brink of a deep and damaging war between two protagonists that have been facing off against each other for much of the past 45 years. This is now one of the most dangerous moments for the entire region. Iran, which became an Islamic Republic after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, has long vowed to destroy the state of Israel, which it calls the ""Zionist regime"". Israel accuses Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) of spreading violence across the Middle East through its allies and proxies, a view shared by several Arab governments. Israel is poised to retaliate against Iran for Tuesday’s volley of ballistic missiles, some of which penetrated Israel’s air defences. Iran says that was in response to two assassinations by Israel - of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. So what happens next?Both Israel and its closest ally, the US, have vowed to punish Iran for launching 180 missiles at Israel. ""Iran,"" says Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, ""will pay a heavy price. ""  Follow live updates on this storyWatch: Video shows Iran's missile attack on IsraelExplained: What we know about Iran's missile attack on IsraelExplained: What is Israel's Iron Dome missile system and how does it work?On the ground: First came the alert message, then the boom of interceptions The restraint that Israel’s allies urged on it the last time there was a standoff like this in April is more muted this time. And given Israel’s determination to take on all its enemies at once - in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and Syria - the Netanyahu government seems to be in no mood to hold back. Israeli planners will likely now be debating not if and when to hit Iran, but how hard.  Aided by US satellite intelligence and by Mossad (Israel’s overseas spy agency) human agents on the ground in Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has a wide range of targets to choose from. These can broadly be divided into three categories:Conventional military - An early and obvious target will be the bases from which Iran launched those ballistic missiles. So that means launch pads, command-and-control centres, refuelling tanks and storage bunkers. It could go further and hit bases belonging to the IRGC as well as air defences and other missile batteries. It could even try to assassinate key individuals involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme. Economic - This would include Iran’s most vulnerable state assets - its petrochemical plants, its power generation and possibly its shipping interests. This, however, would be a deeply unpopular move in Iran as it would end up hurting ordinary people’s lives far more than any attack on the military. Nuclear - This is the big one for Israel. It is a known fact, established by the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, that Iran is enriching uranium well beyond the 20% needed for civil nuclear power. Israel, and others, suspect Iran of trying to reach ""breakout point"" where it is within a very short timescale of being able to build a nuclear bomb. Sites on Israel’s possible target list include Parchin, the epicentre of Iran’s military nuclear programme, research reactors at Tehran, Bonab and Ramsar, as well as major facilities at Bushehr, Natanz, Isfahan and Ferdow. A large part of their calculations will involve trying to second guess Iran’s response in turn and how to mitigate it. The Iranian position is that after launching those missiles at what it says were Israeli military targets on Tuesday the score is now settled. But it is warning that if Israel retaliates it will hit back in turn. ""This is only a glimpse of our capabilities,"" said Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC reinforced this message, stating: ""If the Zionist regime responds to Iran’s operations, it will face crushing attacks. "" Iran cannot defeat Israel militarily. Its air force is old and decrepit, its air defences are porous and it has had to contend with years of Western sanctions. But it still has an enormous quantity of ballistic and other missiles as well as explosive-laden drones and numerous allied proxy militias around the Middle East. Its next volley of missiles could well target Israeli residential areas, rather than military bases. The attack by an Iran-backed militia on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in 2019 showed just how vulnerable its neighbours are to attack. The IRGC Navy, which operates in the Gulf, has large flotillas of small, fast missile attack boats which could, potentially, overwhelm the defences of a US Navy 5th Fleet warship in a swarm attack. If it had orders to do so, it could attempt to sow mines in the Strait of Hormuz, interrupting the flow of up to 20% of the world’s daily oil exports, something that would have a major impact on the global economy. And then there are all the US military bases, dotted up and down the Arabian side of the Gulf, from Kuwait to Oman. Iran has given warning that if it is attacked it won’t just hit back at Israel, it will target any country it perceives as supporting that attack. These then, are just some of the scenarios that defence planners in Tel Aviv and Washington will now be considering.","How could Israel respond, and what might Iran do then?","How could Israel respond, and what might Iran do then?",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg9k5l19njo,articles/article_3021.txt,results/article_3021.txt.json
3022,2024-10-17 15:39:33.737000+00:00,/news/articles/c77x05l5ze4o,"Since Israel began a renewed military offensive in northern Gaza 12 days ago, humanitarian groups say that virtually no aid has entered the area. Israel's own statistics show that aid deliveries to Gaza as a whole have collapsed when compared with the same period in September. This has prompted accusations that the Israeli military is blocking food aid deliveries in a bid to starve out Hamas fighters. The lack of food has prompted a top UN official to warn that ""supplies for survival are running out"" in north Gaza, with civilians on the ground telling the BBC that the situation is unsustainable. Joyce Msuya, the UN's Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, said on Monday that Israel blocked all food aid entering northern Gaza from 2-15 October. She said a ""trickle"" of aid had been allowed to enter the territory on Monday, but warned that a lack of fuel deliveries would force bakeries to close within days.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that his government is deliberately preventing food from reaching northern Gaza. But the US has warned its ally to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off, and now says it is monitoring Israel's actions in northern Gaza to ensure it's not pursuing ""a policy of starvation"". On Thursday, a UN-backed assessment warned that “the risk of famine persists across the whole Gaza Strip”, adding: “Given the recent surge in hostilities, there are growing concerns that this worst-case scenario may materialize. ” The Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said a total of 5,840 tons of food crossed into Gaza in the first 12 days of October, compared to a total of 75,898 tons in September. The UN said no aid at all had entered north Gaza for the two weeks before last Sunday, when the US warned its ally in a letter to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off. In its own statistics, the UN said the number of lorries entering Gaza was the lowest since the beginning of the war a year ago. Briefing the UN security council on Wednesday, Ms Msuya said Israel had facilitated just one of 54 attempts to deliver aid through the Rashid checkpoint in the first two weeks of October. The checkpoint is south of Gaza City, where the main coastal road meets the east-west Israeli military road that effectively divides the territory in half. She added that another four efforts were impeded, but eventually occurred. Ms Msuya said that while distribution of existing stocks in northern Gaza continued, supplies were ""quickly dwindling"". Meanwhile the World Food Programme (WFP) told the Financial Times on Tuesday that it will run out of food aid to distribute in just a week-and-a-half if Israel does not immediately facilitate fresh deliveries to northern Gaza. WFP's director for the Palestinian Territories, Antoine Renard, also told the outlet that his teams on the ground had just a week of flour supplies left. Cogat said 50 trucks carrying aid entered the north of the strip on Wednesday. Georgios Petropoulos - head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza - told the BBC that when aid does enter Gaza through Israeli checkpoints, aid groups often lack the capacity to distribute it effectively on the other side. He pointed out that while 50 truckloads of aid were allowed to enter Gaza on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) allowed just 30 of those to be collected. The IDF launched a renewed offensive against Hamas in the north 12 days ago. It says it is seeking to prevent the group's fighters from regrouping in the area. Military officials issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many refused to leave, exhausted by constant displacement and fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies. Israeli forces have surrounded and bombarded the bombarded the densely-populated Jabalia area, which includes an urban refugee camp, to the north of Gaza City. Israel insists that there is no policy of starvation in northern Gaza, but some have speculated that the fall in humanitarian supplies indicates the implementation of what Israeli media has dubbed ""the Generals' plan"". Retired Maj Gen Giora Eiland recently told the BBC that civilians should be evacuated from northern Gaza, with the remaining Hamas fighters left with a choice to ""surrender or starve"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted in an interview with Le Figaro that the ""allegation that we are pursuing a deliberate policy of starving the population is completely baseless"". He had previously told the UN that Israel was facilitating the entry of food amounting to ""more than 3,000 calories a day for every man, woman, and child in Gaza"". People in northern Gaza have told the BBC that supplies of food and water have plummeted in recent days. Awad Hassan Ashour from Jabalia said residents of his area were getting very little food and water was also scarce""Every two or three days they bring us one meal, either lunch or breakfast,” he said. Yousef Qarmout, a displaced person in Jabalia, told the BBC that food and water shortages were making ""untenable"" for those living in the area. What little food remained on sale was prohibitively expensive, he said. ""Life is becoming ever more untenable in northern Gaza, there is no food at all,"" he said. ""We also suffer from high prices - take for example a can of beans. It costs 20 shekels [£4; $5.30], which is too much for me because I don’t work, nor do my children work. We all do not have any source of income. "" Sayab al-Zad said it was almost impossible to obtain meat or fresh vegetables, noting that only a few people could afford such produce. Instead, his family largely subsisted on bread, he said. ""To get bread for us is a very big challenge, you can lose your life for getting bread,"" he said. Mr Petropoulos said organised criminal gangs operating in Gaza were exacerbating the problem, with many aid drivers reporting being robbed while transporting food and shelter items. ""I see that the shelters of families are being winterised with plastic sheeting. You can see them starting to be put on top of these boxes of plastic that people live in,"" he told the BBC. ""The problem is that we were supposed to give that to the people who need it for free. But they’ve been looted and sold to them and now instead of getting a plastic sheet free so that at least you have a waterproof roof for the rain you’re in further debt. ""The damage we’re seeing done through looted equipment and supplies being sold back to people already in desperate poverty is just immense. ""Israel has long accused Hamas accused of hijacking and stealing aid deliveries - something the group has denied. Michael Fakhri, the UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to food, accused Israel of pursuing a deliberate policy of starvation in Gaza during an interview with the BBC's Newshour programme on Monday. ""We've seen the effects of their starvation campaign, with high mortality rates - people are dying, not just from hunger, but from dehydration and disease, which often follows,"" he said. ""Israel has told us what it's doing, it's done it, and we've seen the effects. ""Thursday's report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said about 1.84 million people were experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, with 664,000 of them facing “emergency” levels of hunger and almost 133,000 facing “catastrophic” levels. The last figure is three-quarters lower than at the time of the last report in June - a fall the IPC attributed to a temporary surge in humanitarian assistance and commercial supplies between May and August. However, the IPC said it expected the number of people facing “catastrophic” hunger to nearly triple in the coming months because there had been a sharp decline in aid deliveries and food availability since September. In response to the report, UN Secretary General António Guterres said on X: “Famine looms. This is intolerable. Crossing points must open immediately, bureaucratic impediments must be removed, and law and order restored so UN agencies can deliver lifesaving humanitarian assistance. ”Concerns over the situation have been growing in Washington, and prompted the warning from top officials giving Israel 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off. The US letter to the Israeli government was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin. The pair said they were writing to ""underscore the US government’s deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory"". But the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, scorned the US warning. ""The US has been saying to Israel that they have to improve humanitarian support to Gaza, but they gave one month delay,"" he told reporters in Brussels. ""One month delay at the current pace of people being killed. It's too many people.

3023,2024-10-04 17:54:11.932000+00:00,/news/articles/cgry10924jqo,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched. The cost of oil affects everything from the price of food at the supermarket to how much it costs to fill up your car. The price of crude oil has risen almost 10% this week to around $78 a barrel as the conflict has intensified. That may seem like a big jump, but the price of crude oil tends to be volatile, and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a barrel of benchmark Brent crude hit almost $130. The uptick comes as many countries, including the UK, are just beginning to recover from the sharp rise in oil prices after the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. So how worried should we be? Crude oil is a key ingredient in petrol and diesel, meaning higher oil prices could drive up prices at the pumps just when they've just hit their lowest level for three years. If a company delivering goods, such as food, is hit by higher fuel costs, it is also likely to raise its prices. These increased costs could then be passed on by supermarkets selling the food to us, the consumer. The cost of living goes up. ""Everything we go and buy in the shop has been transported around and has been made from things that have been transported around. The increase in fuel costs tends to filter into everything,"" Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, tells the BBC. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has warned the conflict in the Middle East has the potential to have a ""very serious"" impact on the UK. Mr Bailey said he was watching developments ""extremely closely"". This comes as he signalled interest rates are on the path downwards, and the UK's prospects on inflation - which has come down after being driven up by high oil and gas prices in 2022 - are looking brighter. Yet so far a rise to about $78 a barrel is not the time for alarm bells. If the ""worst-case scenario"" of further escalation does not materialise, oil prices are likely to ""ease back quite quickly"", says Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. Iran is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, with half of its exports going to China. If supplies were disrupted, China could turn to Russia. But Ms Bain warns markets are ""finely balanced"", and if the conflict escalates, ""taking out a medium-sized supplier like Iran would lead to a spike in prices"". She says there is ""more than enough capacity"" globally to cover the gap if Iranian production is lost, but there is the question of where Saudi Arabia's ""loyalty will lie"" as the world's second largest oil producer and whether it will increase or restrict further production. Mr Macpherson says if Israel did decide to attack Iran's oil sector, a rise in the price of Brent crude could increase the cost of filling up at the pumps ""quite quickly"". He explains that this scenario could threaten general inflation in the UK, which could in turn influence any decision from the Bank of England to lower interest rates. However, he also points out ""there might not ultimately be any disruption to supply"" at all. The direct impact of Iran's oil production is not the only concern. There is a risk that any escalation in the region could block the Strait of Hormuz, a relatively narrow channel through which a huge amount of oil tanker traffic passes -about a third of total seaborne-traded oil. It is also the path through which a fifth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is transported, a commodity that the world has become more dependent on since sanctions were imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Asia is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, and the immediate impact of an escalation would be significant. Disruption to LNG shipments from one of the world's biggest exporters in Qatar would lead to higher gas prices - which could in turn lead to a rise in household gas and electricity bills. As with oil, gas prices filter down supply chains, affecting the cost of virtually all goods. UK energy bills have risen 10% for this winter, but are currently predicted to fall slightly in January. This forecast could change of course, if an escalation to the conflict in the Middle East affects global gas supplies, and leads to higher prices. But Ms Bain says the risk of strait being blocked as a result of the conflict is small. And if it does transpire, Mr Macpherson adds the effect on the UK would be minimal, given that most of Europe's gas is supplied mainly from Norway. There are a lot of possible outcomes, but in terms of what will happen with oil prices in the coming weeks and months, ""nobody knows"", Mr Macpherson admits. There's a ""wide spectrum"" of what could come next, he adds, but ""there is really no way of telling where we will be this time next week"".",How worried should I be about rising oil prices?,How worried should I be about rising oil prices?,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgry10924jqo,articles/article_3023.txt,results/article_3023.txt.json
3024,2024-09-27 17:22:28.790000+00:00,/news/articles/cn5zk4gnr40o,"Israel has launched a series of huge air strikes in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, targeting what it says is Hezbollah’s central headquarters. At least two people have been killed and 76 injured, according to Lebanese officials, after several buildings were hit in Dahieh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in the south of the city. BBC reporters in Beirut said explosions were followed by chaotic scenes with nearby roads packed with people fleeing. The Israeli military said the headquarters it targeted was located ""under residential buildings"". Israeli and US media said the strike targeted Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. It was too early to say if Nasrallah was hit, an Israeli official told reporters.  Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told state TV that Israel was crossing Tehran's red lines. ""Assassinations will not solve Israel's problem. . . With the assassination of resistance leaders, others will take their place,"" he told state TV, Reuters reported. Iran's embassy in Beirut meanwhile said the strike on Dahieh was a ""dangerous game changer"". The attack took place shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “defeat Hezbollah” in a speech at the UN. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said it showed Israel ""does not care"" about US-led efforts to bring about a ceasefire. Israel has sharply escalated its campaign against the Lebanese armed group, with which it has been trading cross-border fire for nearly a year. Air strikes on southern and eastern Lebanon this week have killed nearly 800 people, many of them civilians, Lebanese officials say. The US had no advance warning of Israel's attack on Dahieh, the Pentagon said. Hezbollah continued firing into Israel on Friday evening, with air raid alerts sounding in multiple areas in the north of the country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a ""direct hit from a Hezbollah rocket was identified"" on a house and car in the city of Safed. On Thursday allies including the US, UK and EU called for a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon. The 12-strong bloc proposed an immediate 21-day pause in fighting ""to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement"" and a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting the Palestinian armed group Hamas. However in his UN General Assembly speech Netanyahu said Israel would continue attacking Hezbollah to achieve its goal of returning about 70,000 displaced Israelis to their homes in northern Israel. ""As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice. And Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that's exactly what we're doing,"" he told the UN. Netanyahu's office later said he had cut short his trip to the US and was returning to Israel. In his own speech to the UN on Thursday, Mikati warned that hospitals were no longer capable of treating people because of the sheer number of casualties from Israel’s attacks. ""Israel is violating our sovereignty by sending their war planes and drones to our skies, by killing our civilians, including youth, women and children, destroying homes and forcing families to flee under harsh humanitarian conditions,"" he said. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Live: Latest news on Israel and HezbollahExplained: What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Watch: Hezbollah rockets hit residential areas in IsraelAnalysis: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has since killed more than 41,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on 8 October, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The group, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries, has launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It has also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. Israel had responded with thousands of its own air, drone and artillery strikes targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon before ramping up its bombardment this week.

3025,2024-10-15 09:14:00.847000+00:00,/news/articles/cy435dx0jpko,"David Cameron has urged the UK to consider sanctioning two Israeli ministers as a way of ""putting pressure"" on the country to act within international law. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former Conservative foreign secretary said before the election he had been ""working up"" plans to put sanctions on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. He described the two men as ""extremist"" and said using sanctions would send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that ""this is not good enough and has to stop"". The BBC has contacted Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for a response.  Lord Cameron said both men had ""said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out"". Earlier this year, Smotrich suggested it might be ""justified and moral"" to starve Gazans and has called for Palestinian residents to leave and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"". Asked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, Lord Cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024, said he had been advised that it would have been ""too much of a political act"" during the election. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned comments by the Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as ""entirely unacceptable"".  Speaking at a Labour conference event, external last month, he said: ""We are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. ""I’m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. I’m in discussions with G7 partners, particularly European partners, on that. I’m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review. ""Asked in Parliament about sanctioning the Be-Gvir and Smotrich, Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said that the government kept its sanctions regime ""closely under review"" and would announce any changes.  Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Lord Cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go. The imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. But they said the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. There were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the Middle East were polarised. It is also understood the United States at the time opposed sanctioning Mr Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The UK tends to impose sanctions alongside US and the European Union to maximise their impact. The Foreign Office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources said any decision on sanctioning the two Israeli ministers might be delayed until after the US election. They also said that with such little UK leverage over Israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. Labour has already restricted UK arms sales to Israel, refunded the UN agency helping Palestinians, and lifted opposition to the International Criminal Court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.  Another decision against the Israeli government might be seen as one step too far. The sources also said there was the risk UK sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers. Tom Keatinge, from the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told the BBC that putting sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would be a ""significant move"" aimed at sending a ""major political message"" to Israel. He also said there was ""not a precedent"" for the UK government sanctioning elements of an ally country. He added that there were ""practical issues"" as sanctions required ""a lot of work"" and that the Foreign Office's sanctions director was already ""heavily overworked"" due to issues related to Russia. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it said had ""supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank"". The three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost, Meitarim Outpost, and Shuvi Eretz Outpost. The four organisations targeted are Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a religious school; Hashomer Yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; Torat Lechima, an Israeli charity and Amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. The announcement follows previous sanctions announced in February, external and May. , external The foreign secretary said the measures would ""help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights"". Lord Cameron argued the UK government should seek to influence Israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the ""wrong path"" of suspending arms exports. Last month, the UK government restricted arms sales to Israel saying there was a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. But Lord Cameron said restricting arms sales to Israel while simultaneously helping to protect the country from Iranian attacks ""made no sense"". The former PM said everyone wanted to see the conflict end, but ""end in a sustainable way"". He said Israel had faced attacks from Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north and it was right to back the country's right to self-defence. ""But it is not a blank cheque, it is not unconditional,"" he said. ""We do want to make sure aid gets through into Gaza, we do want to see the role of the UN in Lebanon to be respected.

3026,2024-09-05 09:18:56.999000+00:00,/news/articles/c303y5m1p19o,"The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has told the BBC that justice must be seen to be done after seeking an arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister and defence minister. Karim Khan said it was important to show the court would hold all nations to the same standard in relation to alleged war crimes. He also welcomed the new UK government's decision to drop its opposition to the arrest warrants. “There's a difference of tone and I think of substance in relation to international law by the new government. And I think that's welcome,” he told Political Thinking with Nick Robinson. He has also requested warrants for three Hamas leaders, two of whom have since been killed. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Khan explained the ICC needed to request warrants for leaders on both sides to ensure people around the world thought the court was applying “the law equally based upon some common standards”. “If one had applied for warrants in relation to Israeli officials and not for Gaza, [some would] say: ‘well, this is an obscenity’ and, ‘how on earth is that possible?’” he said. “You can't have one approach for countries where there's support, whether it's Nato support, European support [and] powerful countries behind you, and a different approach where you have clear jurisdiction,"" he added. In May, Mr Khan said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahiya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October onwards. However the request for the warrants must yet be approved by ICC judges.  Mr Khan said Israel's prime minister and defence minister were suspected of crimes including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, and extermination. He accused the Hamas leaders of having committed crimes including extermination, murder, hostage taking, rape and sexual violence, and torture. Israel and Hamas have both rejected the allegations. US President Joe Biden said the application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders was ""outrageous"". But Mr Khan told the BBC that unlike his critics, he had seen the evidence the warrant requests were based on. “I have one advantage at least. Hopefully even they will concede I've seen the evidence. They haven't,"" he said. “The application is not public. It is confidential. It is filed to the chamber. So they are guessing what evidence has been submitted. ""The previous UK Conservative government had indicated it planned to make a submission to the court, having questioned the right of the prosecutor to apply for a warrant against the Israeli leaders. But in July, a spokesperson for the Labour administration which succeeded it said the issue was a ""matter for the court"" and therefore would not be making a submission. Mr Khan told the BBC he had been pressured by some world leaders not to issue warrants. “Several leaders and others told me and advised me and cautioned me,” he said. Turning to the war in Ukraine, Mr Khan said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""see the inside of a courtroom"", pointing to historic cases of other world leaders being brought before the court. “Nothing is permanent. Life is transitory. And every political life ends in failure,"" he said. Mr Putin was not arrested during his visit on Tuesday to Mongolia, an ICC signatory, despite the valid arrest warrant for alleged war crimes committed during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian leader is wanted for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children since the start of the war in 2022. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were ""outrageous"". ------Karim Khan's interview with Nick Robinson will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 BST on Saturday and is already available on BBC Sounds and the Political Thinking website.",ICC chief prosecutor defends Netanyahu arrest warrant in BBC interview,ICC chief prosecutor defends Netanyahu arrest warrant in BBC interview,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c303y5m1p19o,articles/article_3026.txt,results/article_3026.txt.json
3027,2024-10-28 19:14:04.986000+00:00,/news/articles/cgk1xg0gjg8o,"The most senior prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, has denied allegations of sexual misconduct and asked for an immediate investigation. In a statement, he announced that he had asked the ICC's watchdog, the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM), to conduct the investigation. He also said he had requested an inquiry into what he termed apparent ""disinformation"" related to the case. This move follows recent media reports which cited a document outlining accusations against Mr Khan. They are understood to include unwanted sexual touching and ""abuse"".  This is denied by Mr Khan, who has said he will co-operate fully with the inquiry. The ICC has been under intense scrutiny following the prosecutor's request for arrest warrants linked to the conflict in Gaza. This development comes after the president of the ICC's Assembly of States Parties (ASP), the court's management oversight and legislative body, revealed last week that the IOM had been in contact with the alleged victim, but said it was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. According to the Guardian newspaper, the female lawyer who was subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Mr Khan, over an extended period of time and in various locations, had concerns about the IOM's competence and was not given adequate opportunity to have the matter investigated by an external body. ASP President Paivi Kaukoranta referenced the IOM's 2023-2024 annual report, which states that, ""following the conversation with the alleged victim, the IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. Measures to safeguard everyone’s rights were recommended. ""In an earlier statement, Mr Khan did not explicitly blame Israel, but did juxtapose the sexual misconduct allegations and efforts to undermine his position when he described this as ""a moment in which myself and the International Criminal Court are subject to a wide range of attacks and threat"". But the sexual misconduct allegations are understood to pre-date his request for arrest warrants linked to the conflict in Gaza. A panel of three ICC judges is currently considering requests by Mr Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. The court of last resort was set up to deal with the most heinous crimes of an international nature when countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute high ranking individuals accused of atrocities. Mr Khan said he learnt that the accusations were to be ""aired publicly"" with ""deep sadness"", and that there was ""no truth to suggestions of such misconduct"". The serious allegations have reached the public domain at a sensitive moment for the ICC. Based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, the ICC now faces an unrivalled crisis, with intensifying internal wranglings over the handling of the allegations, and apparent efforts by the court’s critics to politicise them. Kaukoranta said the ICC had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" towards prohibited conduct, such as harassment, including sexual harassment, discrimination and abuse of authority, and that she remained ""in contact with all  individuals concerned to ensure that everyone's rights continue to be safeguarded"".",ICC prosecutor denies sexual misconduct allegations,ICC prosecutor denies sexual misconduct allegations,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgk1xg0gjg8o,articles/article_3027.txt,results/article_3027.txt.json
3028,2024-08-02 05:06:44.319000+00:00,/news/articles/c87r7jpl5zlo,"An Australian government review has found that ""serious failures"" by the Israeli military led to drone strikes on an aid convoy that killed seven workers in Gaza. The strike on 1 April killed charity workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US, as well as their Palestinian colleague.  The review, released on Friday, concluded that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) failed to follow procedures and made identification and decision-making errors. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the Australian government would ""press for full accountability"" for those responsible for the incident, ""including any appropriate criminal charges"".  ""The military advocate general of Israel is still to decide on further action,"" she said in a statement on Friday. The IDF had launched an internal investigation amid intense international pressure and sacked senior officers after acknowledging that the strike was a ""serious failure"" and a ""grave mistake"". The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The convoy was hit in the Gazan city of Deir al-Balah when drone operators did not follow rules and thought WCK's cars were carrying Hamas gunmen, the IDF's inquiry said. WCK founder José Andrés had accused Israeli forces of targeting his aid workers ""systematically, car by car"". While WCK recognised at the time that the IDF's admission of failure was an important step forward, it called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack. ""It is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement,"" WCK said in a statement in April. ""We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza. ""Shortly after the attack, the Australian government appointed former defence force chief Mark Binskin as a special advisor on a review into the WCK workers' deaths. Ms Wong said at the time that Mr Binskin would examine the ""sufficiency and appropriateness of the steps taken by the Israeli government"" in relation to the incident. Following the release of the review on Friday, Ms Wong said the Australian government would implement all of Mr Binskin's recommendations, including calls for Israel to improve coordination with humanitarian organisations working on the ground. The IDF had also said that it had formally reprimanded three commanders for their overall responsibility in the strikes, and that those who carried out the attack could face criminal prosecution. Ms Wong said Israel is still in the process of determining accountability. ""Our expectation remains that there be transparency about the military advocate general's process and decision,"" she added.

3029,2024-10-23 19:41:50.901000+00:00,/news/articles/cx24ngy9g70o,"As someone who served four Israeli prime ministers and was deputy head of the country’s National Security Council, Eran Etzion’s judgement was trusted at the highest levels of the state. A longstanding critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he is also someone whose years of public service earned him widespread respect. But now Mr Etzion, a former soldier himself, is warning that Israel’s military - the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)  - might be committing war crimes in northern Gaza. And he is suggesting that officers and troops should reject illegal orders. “They should refuse. If a soldier or an officer is expected to commit something that might be suspected as a war crime, they must refuse. That's what I would do if I were a soldier. That's what I think any Israeli soldier should do,” he tells me. We are sitting on the balcony of his home in Shoresh in central Israel. Here there is the quiet sunshine of an autumn morning. A peaceful neighbourhood where some builders are working on house improvements. Less than 40 miles down the road is the Gaza neighbourhood of Jabalia. As Mr Etzion and I are speaking, doctors and medical staff at the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia are sending desperate voice notes to the international community begging for aid. One senior nurse - in a message heard by the BBC - speaks in an exhausted voice of relentless privations allegedly imposed by the Israelis besieging Jabalia. “My friend, I’m so so tired,” he says. “I can’t explain how tired I am. The water is empty. We don't have water. We contacted the Israeli force to allow us to charge water to the tank, but they don't accept that. . . . And we don't know what will happen tomorrow. The situation is very very bad. ”Another nurse says: “I am sorry for my language, I can't talk well. I am very fatigued and dizzy. I haven't eaten since yesterday. We try to give the food that we found to the patients and families and we don't eat ourselves. ”Tens of thousands of people are now fleeing Jabalia as the Israeli army continues its offensive against what it says is an attempt by Hamas to regroup. Mr Etzion is worried for the civilians of Jabalia and his country. “There is a very dangerous erosion of norms. There is a very widespread sense of revenge, of rage,” he says. This is because, Mr Etzion says, Israel is in the grip of trauma after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks in which around 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 taken hostage into Gaza. “The will to revenge could be understood. It's human, but we're not a gang, we're not a terror organisation, and we're not a militia. We're a sovereign country. We have our history, we have our morals, we have our values, and we must operate under international law and under international standards if we want to continue to be a member of the international community, which we do. ”He is speaking out as a former soldier, as someone whose children served in the IDF, and whose family and friends still serve. “I'm just a concerned citizen trying to raise my voice. So that's what I'm doing. I want to make sure that no soldier is involved in anything that could be constituted as a war crime. ”Israel has faced mounting international criticism over its conduct during the war. The United States has threatened to cut arms shipments if Israel does not surge aid into Gaza. The UN has accused the Israelis of repeatedly blocking or impeding the transfer of aid, most recently into northern Gaza. The IDF has consistently rejected allegations that it is implementing a deliberate policy of starvation to force residents to flee from Jabalia. Israel has long accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields, launching attacks from schools and medical facilities. “Hamas does not hesitate to abuse Gazans, exploit them, steal aid from them, and forcefully prevent them from evacuating when it is necessary for them to do so,” the IDF said in May. One of Britain’s most prominent war crimes lawyers, Prof Philippe Sands KC, told me that while Israel had a right to self defence after the 7 October attacks, it was now violating international law. “It has to be proportionate. It has to meet the requirements of international humanitarian law. It must distinguish between civilians and military targets. ""It doesn't allow you to use famine as a weapon of war. It doesn't allow you to forcibly deport or evacuate large numbers of people. ""So it's impossible to see what is going on now in Gaza, as it's impossible to see what happened on 7 October, and not say crimes are screaming out. ”Prof Sands has led the genocide case against Myanmar, and the case for Palestinian statehood at the International Court of Justice in the Hague. His book East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity won the Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction. The book also details his own Jewish family’s experience of the Holocaust. I ask if the crisis in Gaza makes him worry about the survival of international law. He points to the fact that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and defence minister. The prosecutor also sought warrants for three Hamas leaders. All three, including Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, are now dead. ""It [international law] is not working on the ground in relation to Russia and Ukraine. It's not working on the ground in relation to Sudan. It's not working on the ground in relation to Palestine and Israel. ""There's just no ifs and buts. We just have to, we have to recognize that. But that is not a reason to tear up the entire system. ""If you ask yourself what the alternative is, which is basically no pieces of paper with the words Treaties written on it, you're back to the 1930s, and at least what we have now is a system of rules which allows people to stand up and say: ‘This is a violation of a treaty'. ”We asked the IDF for an interview but they said no spokesperson was available today, and referred us to an earlier statement which says: “The IDF will continue to act, as it always has done, according to international law. ” And today the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the army’s humanitarian relief wing, said it was their policy to facilitate the entrance of aid into Gaza “without limits”. This is Israel’s narrative. But as scenes of civilian suffering continue to emerge from Jabalia it is being widely challenged.

On Tuesday night's episode, contestant Ali Bromley was seen wearing a black T-shirt displaying a watermelon in the shape of British Mandate Palestine, while she was in the garden of the Big Brother house. The watermelon symbol has been used to show solidarity with Palestinians, external during the Israel-Gaza war. The episode has since been edited and ITV said the housemate had told them she was ""unaware of the implications"" of the symbol and ""did not wish to cause offence"". After the episode aired, it was removed from ITVX and re-uploaded on Wednesday with the watermelon symbol removed from Bromley's T-shirt. A spokesman for Big Brother said it did not ""allow any personal items into the house that could be deemed harmful"".

""It added that the item of clothing had now been removed from the house and the housemate ""expressed that they are unaware of the implications and did not wish to cause any harm or offence"". Tuesday's episode of Big Brother Late & Live was also edited to remove the footage of Bromley wearing the top. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Hamas attack on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. The watermelon symbol is synonymous with the pro-Palestinian movement as the colours of the fruit are the same as those on the Palestinian flag. Following Tuesday's episode, charity Campaign Against Antisemitism said it had submitted a complaint to Ofcom as the ""incident represents a serious violation of broadcasting standards"". In a statement on X, the organisation said the graphic was anti-Semitic and ""caused significant distress among the British Jewish community, who regard it as a genocidal message similar to the slogan From the River to the Sea which calls for the elimination of the world’s only Jewish state.

3031,2024-10-12 18:10:21.687000+00:00,/news/articles/c80r9zyk89yo,"Israeli army vehicles had already pounded the dirt road into dust where we crossed into Lebanon, breaking through a hole in the fence that marks the ceasefire line drawn between the two countries a generation ago. The ceasefire itself is already in tatters. Israel’s ground invasion along this border last week was launched, it said, to destroy Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Ten days on, the army was taking us to a village a couple of miles into Lebanese territory, where it had just established “some level of control”. We were told not to reveal where it is, for military reasons, and our movements were restricted. Israeli artillery was blasting through the air as we arrived. The brigade commander, Col Yaniv Malka, told us the area was still not clear of Hezbollah fighters. Bursts of small-arms fire were from fighting that was taking place 500m away, he said, describing “face-to-face combat” with Hezbollah fighters inside the village just a couple of days before – meaning, he said, “my troops seeing in their eyes, and fighting them in the streets”. All along the central path through the village, houses lay demolished; piles of rubble leaching glimpses of family life. Buildings left standing were shot through with artillery, missing corners or walls and peppered with gunshot and shrapnel holes. Two tanks sat in churned up earth near what was once a village square. The level of destruction around them is reminiscent of Gaza. Our movements on the ground were restricted by the army to a limited area of the village, but neighbouring buildings and communities appeared, from a distance, to be untouched. These incursions seem – so far – to be more “limited and targeted” geographically than militarily. The graffiti on a building commandeered by troops read: “We wanted peace, you wanted war”. “Most of the terrorists ran away,” Col Malka told me. “[But] dozens of houses were booby-trapped.  When we went house to house, we discovered booby-traps and weapons. We had no choice but to destroy them. ”We only have the army’s account of what happened here. I asked an army spokesman whether any women or children were present when the operation here began. He replied that all civilians had been given ample warning to leave. The human rights group Amnesty International this week described Israel’s evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon as inadequate and overly general, and said they did not absolve the country of its obligations under international law. We were also shown three caches of weapons it said were found inside civilian homes here, including boxes of brand-new mortars, new anti-tank missiles and mines, as well as sophisticated shoulder launched rockets and night-scopes. One anti-tank missile we saw was already semi-assembled. The chief of staff for the 91st Division, Roy Russo, also showed us a garage he said had been used as an equipment warehouse, with sleeping bags, body armour, rifles and ammunition hidden in a large barrel. “This is what we call an exchange zone,” he said. “They’re morphing from civilians into combatants. All this gear is designed to manoeuvre into [Israel] and conduct operations on the Israeli side. This is not defensive equipment. ”This, Israel says, is why it launched its invasion of southern Lebanon; that Hezbollah’s stockpiles of weapons and equipment along this border were planning for a cross-border attack similar to last year’s 7 October attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. At the start of this invasion, the army revealed that Israeli special forces had been operating across the Lebanese border in small tactical units for almost a year, conducting more than 70 raids to find and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including underground tunnels – one of which, it said, stopped 30m (100ft) before the ceasefire line with Israel and was unfinished. Col Malka showed me some of the weapons he said the army found on the day we arrived. They include a large IED, an anti-personnel mine, and a high-tech night-scope. He said troops were finding “two to three times” the number of weapons they found in Gaza, with “thousands” of weapons and thousands of pieces of ammunition found in this village alone. “We don’t want to hold these places,” he told me. “We want to take all the ammunition and fighting equipment out.  After that, we expect the people will come back, and understand that peace is better for them, and terrorist control over them in a bad thing. ”“But I’ll leave that to the diplomats to solve,” he smiled. After the last ground war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, the UN ruled that Hezbollah must pull back north of the Litani River.  A previous resolution also ordered its disarmament.  Neither decision has been enforced. That ground war in 2006 was a wake-up call for Israel. The Iran-backed militia fought its army to standstill.  For almost 20 years, both sides have been avoiding – and preparing for – the next one. Col Malka fought in Lebanon during that war.  “This one is different,” he said. When I asked why, he replied: “Because of 7th October. ”As we were speaking, the sound of small-arms fire grew louder. He gestured towards it. “That’s my guys fighting in the casbah,” he said. Israel's ground invasion is part of a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah over the past three weeks that has also seen it intensify air strikes on southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut. Lebanon says more than 2,200 people have been killed, mainly during the recent escalation, and more than a million people displaced. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields.  One commander described the ground war as an offensive operation to defend Israeli citizens - an invasion to stop an invasion, in other words. But the speed with which Israel’s forces have been moving through villages along this border may only be the first chapter in this story. Hezbollah tactics have shifted since the ground invasion began, with Israeli towns like Metula – surrounded on three sides by Lebanon – reporting a drop in direct fire from anti-tank missiles, and a rise in rockets fired out of sight from further away. The assessment of many is that Hezbollah fighters have not run away, but simply withdrawn further back into Lebanon. Israel already has four divisions lined up at this border – and a growing chorus of voices inside the country who say this is the moment, not just to push back Hezbollah, but to remake the Middle East. As the fighting near the village intensified, we were told to leave immediately, hurried out to the waiting convoy. Under the shadow of a growing conflict with Iran, Israel’s small successes along this frontier don’t change one key fact: this is not actually a border war, it’s a regional war being fought along a border.",Inside Israel's combat zone in southern Lebanon,Inside Israel's combat zone in southern Lebanon,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80r9zyk89yo,articles/article_3031.txt,results/article_3031.txt.json

But since then, this man says it had been largely quiet - with no sign of house-to-house searches in his neighbourhood, nor of fighters from the camp. ""It’s abnormally quiet,"" he said. The camp has been sealed off by the army since it arrived before dawn on Wednesday - part of a wide, coordinated operation across several centres of the occupied West Bank. Jenin camp is a base for armed Palestinian fighters, but also unarmed civilians.  There have been fierce gun battles here in recent months, as Israeli forces have raided, again and again, looking for them. Army vehicles are also stationed around two of Jenin’s main hospitals. Ambulances are stopped as they approach - approaching and reversing in response to terse instructions broadcast in Arabic from loudspeakers on the army Jeeps. We watched paramedics get out to open the back doors of their ambulance, to show what - or who - was inside. Two female patients were also made to get out and present themselves to soldiers in the Jeeps. Behind them, one of Jenin’s main commercial districts is shuttered and deserted.  Cardboard boxes are scattered across the empty road; fruit sits abandoned on carts under thin cotton covers - the sickly-sweet smell of rotting mangoes fills the silent street. One small grocery shop has been opening in the afternoon – an urban oasis for those who can reach it. Thaeer Shana’at is stocking up on food to deliver to local families in the eastern neighbourhood, where Israeli forces were blocking access, he says.

3035,2024-09-26 11:25:58.486000+00:00,/news/articles/clylgv2dk3yo,"Many hardline conservatives in Iran are growing uneasy about its lack of action as Israel targets the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, their country’s closest and most long-standing ally. When President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, he criticised Israel’s war in Gaza and warned that its attacks on Lebanon could not go unanswered. But Mr Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, adopted a more conciliatory tone than his hard-line predecessors, avoiding rhetoric about annihilating the Islamic Republic’s arch-enemy. “We seek peace for all and have no intention of conflict with any country,” he stated. He also expressed his government's readiness to resume nuclear talks with Western powers, saying: “We are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal. ”Other senior Iranian officials and commanders of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) have also appeared to be unusually restrained when expressing their intentions to take revenge on Israel for its actions against their country and its key allies Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran has armed, funded and trained both armed groups, but Tehran's leaders rely on Hezbollah to be a major deterrent preventing direct attacks on their country by Israel. Iranian support has been critical to Hezbollah’s transformation into Lebanon’s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped found the group in the 1980s. It is the main supplier of the weapons that Hezbollah can deploy against Israel, particularly advanced missiles and drones, and the US has previously alleged that it also provides as much as $700m in funds annually. Last week, Mojtaba Amani, Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, was severely injured when his pager exploded last week at the embassy in Beirut. Thousands more pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members also blew up in two attacks that killed a total of 39 people. Iran blamed Israel, but it made no immediate public threats of retaliation. In contrast, when Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April, killing eight high-ranking IRGC Quds Force commanders, Iran swiftly responded by launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. Iran also vowed to retaliate after blaming Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July, although it has not announced that it has taken any action yet. A former IRGC commander told the BBC that repeatedly threatening Israel without following through was further damaging the force’s credibility among its supporters inside Iran and its proxies abroad. On Monday, President Pezeshkian told members of the US media in New York that Israel was seeking to draw Iran into a war. “Iran is ready to defuse tensions with Israel and lay down arms if Israel does the same,” he insisted. Some hardline conservatives close to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised the president for talking about defusing tensions with Israel, asserting that he should recognize his position and avoid giving live interviews. Mr Pezeshkian was due to hold a press conference in New York on Wednesday, but it was cancelled. It was unclear if he was forced to cancel because of his comments. In Iran, power lies in the hands of Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC. They are the ones making the key strategic decisions, not the president. It is notable that Ayatollah Khamenei also did not mention any plans for retaliation or issue threats toward Israel, which is quite unusual for him, when he addressed veterans on Wednesday. Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist at the US news site Axios, reported on Tuesday that two Israeli officials and Western diplomats had indicated that Hezbollah was urging Iran to come to its aid by attacking Israel. The Israeli officials claimed that Iran had told Hezbollah that “the timing isn’t right”, according to Ravid. Last week, the host of the Iranian internet TV program Maydan, which is known to have ties to the IRGC, cited Iranian intelligence sources as claiming that Israel had also “carried out a special operation last month, killing IRGC members and stealing documents”. He asserted that the Iranian press had been forbidden from reporting on the incident, which allegedly happened inside in Iran, and that the authorities were attempting to control the narrative. In response, Tasnim News Agency, which also linked to the IRGC, denied the allegations. The Islamic Republic finds itself in a precarious situation. It is concerned that attacking Israel could provoke a US military response, dragging the country into a broader conflict. With a crippled economy due to US sanctions and ongoing domestic unrest, a potential US strike against the IRGC could further weaken its the regime’s security apparatus, possibly emboldening the Iranian opponents to rise up once more. However, if Iran refrains from direct intervening in Hezbollah’s conflict with Israel, it risks sending a signal to other allied militias in the region that, in times of crisis, the Islamic Republic may prioritize its own survival and interests over theirs. This could weaken Iran’s influence and alliances across the region.",Iran faces dilemma of restraint or revenge for attacks on ally Hezbollah,Iran faces dilemma of restraint or revenge for attacks on ally Hezbollah,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clylgv2dk3yo,articles/article_3035.txt,results/article_3035.txt.json

The banner featured photos of the three men whose deaths he said Iran was seeking to avenge with the major attack - Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in an attack that Iran blamed on Israel, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC Quds Force operations commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, who were killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last week. The IRGC claimed the barrage included Fattah hypersonic missiles that took 12 minutes to reach Israel and that they successfully hit targets including three Israeli airbases and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency. However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the missiles were “intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States”, and that there were a “small number of hits” in central and southern Israel. Shortly after the attack, a massive banner was raised in Tehran’s Palestine Square, featuring missiles flying towards buildings shaped like a Star of David and the words “The beginning of the end of Zionism”. Iran had appeared to show restraint after Haniyeh's assassination - but this inaction became a source of humiliation when Israel dealt a series of devastating blows to Iran’s closest and most longstanding regional ally Hezbollah, culminating in the air strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah and Nilforoushan. Iranian weapons, training and funding have been pivotal to Hezbollah’s transformation into Lebanon’s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped establish the group in the 1980s. Before this month, Iranian leaders had hoped that a war of attrition with Hezbollah would help wear down the Israeli military, which is still fighting a war against Hamas in Gaza. They also relied on Hezbollah and its massive arsenal of rockets and missiles to serve as a major deterrent against direct Israeli attacks on their country’s nuclear and missile facilities. President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, accused Israel of trying to provoke Iran into a regional war that would also draw in the US. ""We also want security and peace. It was Israel that assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran,"" he was quoted by Iranian media as saying during a visit to Qatar on Wednesday. ""Europeans and the US said that if we do not act, there will be a peace in Gaza in one week. We waited for them to have peace but they increased their killing.

Many hardline conservatives in Iran had been growing uneasy about the country's lack of action against Israel. Several commentators on state TV - which is controlled by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the IRGC - argued that the decision to hold back from seeking revenge for Haniyeh’s killing had emboldened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's interests and allies in Lebanon. After Tuesday's missile attack, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Maj Gen Mohammad Baqeri stated that the time for “patience and restraint” was over. “We targeted military and intelligence sites in Israel and deliberately refrained from hitting economic and industrial locations,” he said. “However, if Israel retaliates, our response will be more forceful. ”The missile attack reflects a growing concern among Iranian leaders that remaining silent after Israel's attacks would portray them as weak and vulnerable - both domestically and in the eyes of their regional allies in the so-called “Axis of Resistance” which includes Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran and Israel have pursued a shadow war for decades, adhering to a policy of “no war, no peace”. However, it now appears that this status quo is ending. Israel has vowed to respond severely, with Netanyahu warning that ""Iran made a big mistake and it will pay for it"". There are also indications of a shift in tone and strategy from the US. In April, President Joe Biden urged restraint after Israeli and US-led forces shot down most of the 300 drones and missiles that Iran launched at Israel in retaliation for an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria that killed several top IRGC commanders. Israel heeded the US call and responded by launching a missile that hit an Iranian air defence battery in central Iran. But this time, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned there would be “severe consequences” for the Iranian attack and that the US will “work with Israel to make that the case”. Israeli media cited Israeli officials as saying on Wednesday that Israel was preparing for retaliatory strikes on Iran “within days”, and that they would target “strategic sites”, including the country’s vital oil facilities. The officials also warned that Iran’s nuclear facilities would be hit if it made good on its threat to strike back at Israel. Senior Iranian officials have asserted that they consider their retaliation for the killing of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan to be over unless they are provoked further. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said he had conveyed a message to the US through the Swiss embassy in Tehran warning it “not to intervene”. He cautioned: “Any third country that assists Israel or allows its airspace to be used against Iran will be considered a legitimate target. ”The US has approximately 40,000 troops stationed in the Middle East, with many deployed in Iraq and Syria. These troops could be threatened by Iran-backed Shia militias in both countries. Iran must now brace itself for the Israeli response and hope its gamble pays off.",Iran gambles with Israel attack after humiliating blows to allies,Iran gambles with Israel attack after humiliating blows to allies,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m93l9krgro,articles/article_3036.txt,results/article_3036.txt.json
3037,2024-08-09 11:57:47.636000+00:00,/news/articles/cvgewyx7pn5o,"In the Saudi city of Jeddah on Wednesday, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of 57 countries, held an emergency meeting at Iran’s request to discuss, among other things, the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The gathering was an opportunity for Iran, whose Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed “harsh punishment” for the killing, to lay out the reasons for an expected retaliation. Both Iran and Hamas say the 31 July assassination was carried out by Israel, which has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind it. Baqeri Ali Bagheri Kani, the acting Iranian foreign minister, said his country had “no choice” but to respond, and that this would take place “at the right time and in the appropriate shape”. Mr Kani also described the possible Iranian reaction as “not only a defence of its own sovereignty and national security” but also a “defence of the stability and security of the entire region”. Haniyeh was killed in a heavily protected guesthouse run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s elite military force, as he visited Tehran for the inauguration of the country’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian, a humiliating breach of Iranian security. Since then, every sign, speech, or statement from Iran has been closely watched for an indication of how and when it might respond, amid concerns the retaliation could lead to a wider conflict with Israel. But Mr Kani offered no clues and, with apparent limited intelligence by the West, it remains unclear what Iran could be planning to do. In April, a strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, killed eight IRGC officers, another attack believed to have been carried out by Israel - and another embarrassing setback for Iran. After days of telegraphing its intentions, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel; almost all of them were intercepted by Israel and a US-led coalition, and the retaliation had no significant impact. Last week, American officials suggested that this time, Iran might have been preparing a bigger operation, perhaps in attempt to avoid repeating that failure. Recent media reports, however, suggest that details of how Haniyeh’s killing was carried out – possibly from inside Iran with local assistance instead of a precise air strike from outside – combined with the fact that no Iranians were killed and diplomatic efforts from Western and Arab countries, might have forced Tehran to reconsider its plans. The Jordanian foreign minister made a rare visit to Iran earlier this week and, on Wednesday, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Mr Pezeshkian and, according to the French presidency, urged him to “do everything to avoid a new military escalation”. Meanwhile, there is also the wait for another expected attack on Israel, from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon. The group has vowed to respond to the killing by Israel of senior commander Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before Haniyeh’s assassination, in its stronghold of Dahiya, in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Concerns of a major conflict in Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its strikes against Israel, a day after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Most of the violence has been contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border, with both Hezbollah and Israel still indicating they are not interested in an all-out war. So far, the group has mainly targeted Israeli military facilities, although its attacks are increasingly more sophisticated and hitting positions deeper inside the country. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has promised a “strong” and “effective” response, described Shukr as one of the “strategic minds of the resistance” and said they had spoken on the phone an hour before his assassination.  In the past, Hezbollah retaliated to the killings of top commanders by launching barrages of rockets at Israel. Having such a high-profile figure assassinated in their base in the Lebanese capital will likely result in a more symbolic response, although almost certain to be within what the group describes as the rules of engagement. In Lebanon, where people still remember the devastation caused by the 2006 war between the Hezbollah and Israel, many fear they are being dragged into a conflict that is not in the nation’s interest. But a damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran’s interest either. With its precision guided missiles and attack drones, Hezbollah is a key element of Iran’s deterrence, right on Israel’s borders. Israel sees the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat, and Hezbollah would probably play a vital role in Iran’s response if its facilities came under Israeli attack. Hezbollah is the main group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an Iranian-backed alliance across the region that includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, which have also carried out attacks on Israel and Western targets since October. It is not known whether Iran and its proxies will co-ordinate their response, although reports in US media suggest Hezbollah may act independently, and first. This week, Gen Michael Kurilla, the head of the US Central Command, visited Israel to assess security preparations, and the US is expected to, again, lead an effort to protect Israel in the case of an Iranian attack. And the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to “exact a heavy price for any act of aggression against us, from whatever quarter”. As the wait continues, flights in both Israel and Lebanon are being cancelled or suspended, airlines are avoiding the countries’ airspaces and foreign governments are urging their citizens to leave.

Millions of people rushed to shelters before explosions lit up the night skies above Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A man was killed by falling missile debris in the city of Jericho in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake"" and ""will pay for it"". Iranian state TV said Iran had fired 200 missiles towards Israel. These included hypersonic weapons, it said, while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the strikes were in retaliation for the killings of the leaders of its allies Hezbollah and Hamas. Within hours of the massive barrage on Tuesday evening local time, Israel's military resumed air strikes against what it said were Hezbollah targets in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. US President Joe Biden said the Iranian missile attack appeared to have been “defeated and ineffective”. The US Department of Defense confirmed its forces had helped shoot down missiles in support of its Middle East ally. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the majority of missiles were ""intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States"". UN secretary general Antonio Guterres condemned what he called the “broadening conflict in the Middle East”, adding: “This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire. ”There was support for Israel from allies including Britain, France, Japan and Australia - with UK Defence Secretary John Healey issuing a statement saying the armed forces ""had played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East"". The missile attack came hours after Israeli troops began an invasion of southern Lebanon to remove what the military said were ""Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages that posed a threat to residents of northern Israel. Israel has gone on the offensive against the Iran-backed Shia Islamist political and military organisation after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war with Hamas in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, drone and missile attacks. Air raid sirens sounded all across Israel at around 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, as the IDF warned missiles had been launched from Iran. Within a few minutes in Jerusalem, loud explosions were heard in Jerusalem as missiles flew overhead and were intercepted by Israeli air defence systems. Videos shared on social media showed streams of light as the missiles flew over Israel, and clouds of smoke as they were intercepted or detonated on impact. Just over an hour later, the IDF announced that people were allowed to leave their protected spaces because it did “not identify any additional aerial threats from Iran”. Later, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that “there were a small number of hits in the centre of Israel, and other hits in Southern Israel”. “The majority of the incoming missiles were intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States. ”He added: “Iran’s attack is a severe and dangerous escalation. There will be consequences. “Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest levels of readiness. Our operational plans are ready. ""We will respond wherever, whenever, and however we choose, in accordance with the directive of the government of Israel. ”US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that he did “not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel”. “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he added. He also condemned the attack as “a significant escalation” and warned: ""We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case. ” Speaking on Wednesday, Iran's chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV that it would hit infrastructure across Israel if it decides to strike back. The barrage ""will be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted"", Mr Bagheri said. Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps said it had targeted unspecified ""sensitive security and military"" centres in retaliation for the ""violation of Iran’s sovereignty and the martyrdom” of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed by an explosion in Tehran in July that Iranian officials blamed on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim. The statement described the missile barrage as having been ""in line with the legitimate right of the nation to defend itself”. It also said the attack was in response to the Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, the operations commander of the IRGC’s overseas arm, the Quds Force. Later, Iranian state media claimed that missiles had hit the Nevatim, Hazterim and Tel Nof air bases, as well as Israeli tanks in Netzarim – a reference to an Israeli military corridor in central Gaza – and gas installations in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. The attack took place about an hour after a senior White House official told reporters that the US had indications that Iran was preparing to imminently launch missiles at Israel. In April, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria that killed several top commanders. Almost all of them were shot down by Israel, the US and other Western allies and their Arab partners, and an air base in southern Israel sustained only minor damage when it was hit. Israel responded by launching a missile that hit an Iranian air base after Western calls for restraint. On Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had promised that the death of his close ally Hassan Nasrallah would “not go unavenged"". He gave no details, but said: ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront. ""Iran has built a network of allied armed groups across the Middle East, which are all opposed to the US and Israel and sometimes refer to themselves as the “Axis of Resistance”.

3039,2024-10-27 18:11:05.217000+00:00,/news/articles/ced99eznje9o,"Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be ""exaggerated or downplayed"" while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would ""give an appropriate response"" to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war. Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had ""severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles"". ""The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals,"" Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks by Hamas. ""This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him. ""Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems. In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: ""It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country. "" He adopted a much more measured tone compared to previous fiery and menacing language. In the past, he has threatened to “flatten Haifa and Tel Aviv” if Israel attacked Iran, or to “hit Israel 10 times if they strike once”. It is uncharacteristic for Khamenei to delegate responsibility to “authorities”, as the commander-in-chief. He has consistently influenced major political decisions in the past 35 years as the supreme leader, undermining the role of the president. This could be an attempt to avoid appearing weak for not responding decisively or to deflect blame if a retaliation were to backfire. President Pezeshkian largely echoed Khamenei's language, telling a cabinet meeting: ""We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country. ""The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Netanyahu's government not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Israel. The Iranian foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran had ""received indications"" about an impending attack hours before it took place. ""We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night,"" Abbas Araghchi told reporters, without going into more detail. Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war. Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the ""limited"" damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians. Fighting continued between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the town of Sidon in southern Lebanon killed at least eight people, according to local authorities. Late on Sunday Lebanon said at least 21 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on the south of the country. In Gaza, nine people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-Shati refugee camp, Palestinians officials said. Palestinian media and the Reuters news agency said three of the dead were Palestinian journalists, citing government officials. And in Israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities said was a suspected terror attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve an exchange of four Israeli hostages for some Palestinian prisoners. He said that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one. But speaking to the BBC's Arabic Service, a senior Hamas official said its conditions for a ceasefire - rejected by Israel for months - have not changed. Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal. ""Any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value,"" he added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

3040,2024-07-31 15:18:34.360000+00:00,/news/articles/cq5xn9enj45o,"The killing of Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran represents a major escalation in the tensions between Iran and Israel. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has blamed Israel for the air strike, and said the killing required “a harsh punishment”. He added that it was Iran's ""duty to avenge his blood"". The country's new president Masoud Pezeshkian echoed this sentiment, saying: “We will make the occupying terrorist regime regret its action. ”Israel has yet to respond but has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders following the 7 October attack launched by the group. Iran has confirmed Mr Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed at a guest house in northern Tehran at 02:00 local time by a missile fired from beyond Iran’s borders.  The immediate concern now is Iran’s response - what shape it might take and whether it would inflame tensions in the region, which are already at an all-time high. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Iran's mission to the UN said the response to the strike would be comprised of ""special operations"", which would be ""harder and intended to instil deep regret to the perpetrator"". In April, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in reaction to the killing of seven of its officers - including a top commander of its Quds Force - in the Syrian capital Damascus. The action was unprecedented in its scope and seriousness, although Israel - together with the US and a number of regional and international partners - managed to destroy almost all the Iranian missiles and drones. It’s thought Iran could now unleash an attack of a similar kind on Israel. Tehran  could also ask its proxy militias in the region to step up their attacks. Lebanon's Hezbollah already has a reason of its own to escalate its cross-border missile war with Israel. The assassination of Mr Haniyeh came only a few hours after the killing of one of the group's own senior military commanders in southern Beirut.  Already there are commentators in the region who believe the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah could themselves spark a full-scale war. The strike happened on a significant day for Iran's leaders. Mr Haniyeh was in the Iranian capital to take part in the swearing-in of newly elected president Masoud Pezeshkian. He was among invited guests at the inauguration ceremony, alongside the leaders of some of Tehran's key allies. The leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, Hezbollah's second-in-command, and a leader from Yemen’s Houthi group were all also front row guests at the ceremony. All received a warm welcome from Ayatollah Khamenei. In his statement on Haniyeh's death, Iran's supreme leader said Israel had ""martyred our dear guest in our house"". Mr Pezeshkian has reacted to the killing on X, saying that while yesterday he was raising his hand in parliament, today he has to shoulder Mr Haniyeh’s coffin. The new Iranian president is viewed as a relatively moderate figure, who has spoken previously about mending relations with the West through dialogue, and putting Iran back on the map as a responsible member of the international community. However, Mr Pezeshkian will be under pressure to take a hard line on Israel and to  support Iran’s proxy militias in the region. But ultimately, it is the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guard that will decide on regional policies and Iran's response. Reports from Tehran say the country’s national security council has held an emergency meeting at Ayatollah Khamenei's residence. What has been decided has not been made public, but the shape and timing of Iran's response are the questions most likely to have been discussed. Iran may decide to move quickly, given that the targeted killing is a major loss of face for Tehran. Does this make all-out war in the region more likely? It is difficult to say. Nobody appears to want such an outcome at the moment, but wars are not always the result of calculated risks.",Iran reels after Hamas leader assassinated in heart of Tehran,Iran reels after Hamas leader assassinated in heart of Tehran,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5xn9enj45o,articles/article_3040.txt,results/article_3040.txt.json
3041,2024-08-13 11:27:26.227000+00:00,/news/articles/c14znyrdkrmo,"Iran has dismissed calls from the UK and other Western countries to refrain from retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Amid a flurry of international diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to ""stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack” in a rare telephone conversation on Monday. But Mr Pezeshkian said retaliation was a “way to stop crime” and Iran’s “legal right”, according to Iranian state media. Israel, which did not say it was involved in Haniyeh’s assassination, has meanwhile put its military on its highest alert level. The US has warned that it is preparing for “a significant set of attacks” by Iran or its proxies as soon as this week, and has built up its military presence in the Middle East to help defend Israel. The powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is also threatening to retaliate over Israel’s killing of one of its top commanders in an air strike in Beirut. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed plans to travel to the Middle East on Tuesday to participate in talks on ending the war in Gaza. On Monday evening, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany issued a joint statement urging Iran and its allies to “refrain from attacks that would further escalate regional tensions”. ""They will bear responsibility for actions that jeopardise this opportunity for peace and stability,” Sir Keir, President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Later, the British prime minister also expressed his deep concerns directly to Iran’s president by telephone - the first such call since March 2021. Sir Keir told Mr Pezeshkian that “there was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration”, Downing Street said. “He called on Iran to refrain from attacking Israel, adding that war was not in anyone’s interests,” it added. On Tuesday morning, Iranian state news agency Irna reported, external that Mr Pezeshkian had told Sir Keir that Western countries’ support for Israel had encouraged it to “continue atrocities” and threatened peace and security. “Pezeshkian stated that from the point of view of the Islamic Republic of Iran, war in any part of the world is not in the interest of any country, emphasizing that a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right of states and a way to stop crime and aggression,” Irna added. The Iranian foreign ministry separately rejected the call for restraint from London, Paris and Berlin. “Such demands are void of political logic, in complete contradiction to the principles and rules of international law, and excessive,” spokesman Nasser Kaanani said. The Israeli military said on Monday that it was taking Iran’s statements seriously. “We are prepared at peak readiness in offence and defence, and we will act according to the directives of the government,” spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a briefing. An Israeli government spokesman meanwhile warned Iran and its allies that Israel would “exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any arena”. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters: “We share the same concerns and expectations that our Israeli counterparts have with respect to potential timing here. [It] could be this week. ”“It is difficult to ascertain at this particular time if there is an attack by Iran and or its proxies, what that could look like, but we have to be prepared,” he added. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has dispatched a second aircraft carrier strike group as well as a guided missile submarine to the Middle East to reinforce what the Pentagon said was the “United States’ commitment to taking every possible step to defend Israel”. The US believes that a new deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages would be the best way to calm tensions in the region, and has called for talks to resume on Thursday. Israel has said it will send a team of negotiators to finalise a deal, while Hamas has indicated an agreement in principle to participate despite the killing of its leader. Hamas said on Sunday that any deal must be based on where talks were a month and a half ago, rather than any new rounds of negotiations. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people have also been killed in the almost daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the conflict.",Iran rejects Western calls to refrain from attack on Israel,Iran rejects Western calls to refrain from attack on Israel,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14znyrdkrmo,articles/article_3041.txt,results/article_3041.txt.json
3042,2024-08-03 13:56:09.843000+00:00,/news/articles/cg64642q0dxo,"Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a ""short-range projectile"" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says. The paramilitary organisation said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a ""strong blast"", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard last Wednesday. The Hamas leader had been visiting the Iranian capital for the inauguration of President Massoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC accused Israel of designing and implementing the operation - supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. The IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives. The failures surrounding Haniyeh's death, especially on a day marked by intense security, have caused embarrassment for Iran and the IRGC.  Dozens of IRGC officers have been arrested or dismissed in the days since Haniyeh's death, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The paper said the organisation's intelligence agency had taken over the investigation. Staff members at Haniyeh's guesthouse have been interrogated and their phones and other electronics have been seized, it added. Meanwhile, the security details of Iranian politicians have been overhauled. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh on Thursday, but was whisked away soon after the ceremony by his security detail. The IRGC's statement on Saturday came after Britain's Daily Telegraph said Haniyeh was killed by bombs planted in his room by agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency Citing Iranian officials, the paper said two Mossad agents had entered the guesthouse and planted explosives in three rooms. The Iranians, who had viewed CCTV footage of the operatives, said the two subsequently left the country before detonating the bombs from outside Iran. The New York Times also reported that Haniyeh was killed by explosives detonated in his room, saying they could have been planted up to two months earlier.  The BBC has not been able to verify these claims. But Hamas officials told the BBC earlier this week that Haniyeh had stayed at the same guesthouse before. He had made up to 15 visits to Iran since becoming the head of the political bureau in 2017. The papers' reports - if true - would represent an even bigger failure for the IRGC, who have long controlled internal security in the country. Experts also said it would highlight the degree to which Mossad can operate with impunity in Iran. Regardless of the manner of Haniyeh's death, both Iran and Hamas have vowed to retaliate. The IRGC said on Saturday that Israel would receive ""a severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner"". Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group in Lebanon, has also vowed reprisals. One of their top commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike last Tuesday. After an Israeli operation killed IRGC Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Damascus earlier this year, Iran fired 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead. . . We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". His ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on the country's communication infrastructure. Despite the government's warnings, the mood appeared relaxed on Tel Aviv's seafront, with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas. But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full-scale war. Israel is on high alert and several international airlines have suspended flights to the country. The US has also deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has warned that the risk that ""the situation on the ground could deteriorate rapidly is rising"". Meanwhile, at least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas-run government media office has said. It comes as Israel said an airstrike it conducted in the occupied West Bank killed a Hamas commander and four senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters on Saturday. The Israeli military said the air strike hit a vehicle as the men were on the way to carry out an attack. Elsewhere, Israeli officials - including the directors of Mossad and the internal security agency Shin Bet - have arrived in Cairo for fresh ceasefire talks. They will meet Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, and other senior military officials in a bid to rescue a potential truce. But US President Joe Biden admitted on Friday that Haniyeh's death had damaged the talks. Haniyeh was heavily involved in negotiations and Mr Biden said his death “doesn’t help” efforts to end the ten-month old conflict. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,550 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Iran says Hamas leader killed from close range,Iran says Hamas leader killed from close range,"israel,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg64642q0dxo,articles/article_3042.txt,results/article_3042.txt.json

Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran early on Wednesday. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined. ""UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region.  Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. The group attacked Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. A response from Hezbollah is almost certain. In the past, the heavily-armed, Iranian-supported group has responded to the killings of senior members by firing barrages of rockets into Israel. The US has updated its travel guidance for citizens, advising them not to travel to Lebanon due to ""rising tensions"", and the UK foreign secretary has urged nationals to leave the country.

3045,2024-09-28 18:11:23.117000+00:00,/news/articles/cj31rgz511no,"Iran’s supreme leader has said the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah ""will not go unavenged"", a day after he was killed in an Israeli air strike in Lebanon. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced five days of mourning in Iran in response to what he called the ""martyrdom of the great Nasrallah"", describing him as ""a path and a school of thought"" that would continue. Iranian media reported that a Iranian Revolutionary Guards general was also killed in the Israeli strikes in Beirut on Friday. Israel’s military said Nasrallah had ""the blood of thousands. . . on his hands"", and that it targeted him while he was ""commanding more imminent attacks"". There are fears that the strike could plunge the wider region into war, after nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the 7 October attacks and war in the Gaza Strip. Key to what happens next in the Middle East is what Ayatollah Khamenei decides. So far, he and other senior Iranian figures have refrained from vowing to retaliate for the series of severe and humiliating blows that Israel has dealt Hezbollah in recent weeks, seemingly because Iran does not want a war with its arch-enemy. Iran also has not carried out its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and other countries. Earlier on Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei urged Muslims to stand by Hezbollah ""with their resources and help"" but did not promise to retaliate for the strike that killed Nasrallah. ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront,"" he said. Reuters news agency meanwhile cited two regional officials as saying that the supreme leader had been transferred to a secure location inside Iran with heightened security measures. They also said Iran was in constant contact with Hezbollah and other allies to determine their next steps, according to the report. Friday’s Israeli strike levelled several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahieh, underneath which the Israeli military said Hezbollah’s central headquarters was located. Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death on Saturday. But it did not comment on the Israeli military’s claim that Ali Karaki, the head of the group’s Southern Front, and other commanders were killed alongside Nasrallah. Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of operations for Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), was also ""martyred"" in Dahiyeh on Friday, according to the IRGC-linked Saberin News outlet. It provided nor further details, although the moderate Didban news website said he was ""assassinated along with"" Nasrallah. However, there has been no official confirmation from Iranian authorities. Iran uses the IRGC to provide Hezbollah with most of its funding, training and weapons, which have allowed the Shia Islamist group to build a military wing stronger than the Lebanese army. The US says the IRGC also oversees the co-ordination of Iran’s network of allied armed groups across the Middle East, which are all opposed to the US and Israel and sometimes refer to themselves as the “Axis of Resistance”. Besides Hezbollah, they include Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria. On Saturday, there were air raid sirens in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after the Houthis launched a missile in support of Hezbollah. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias, also claimed new drone attacks on northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, said Iran’s reputation among its allies was ""certainly damaged"" and that it would be “looking for some way to turn the tables and save some face”. “This could result in a co-ordinated axis response, including from Iraq and the Houthis, or another direct Iranian strike on Israel itself,"" she said. “By maintaining pressure or even escalating, Tehran is aware that this will invite further attacks, but it will choose to do so keep pressure on Israel.

His comments came during an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of states with Muslim-majority populations, which convened in Saudi Arabia to discuss Iran’s response to the killing. The US said it hoped OIC members would caution Iran against taking “steps to escalate the conflict”. Tensions in the Middle East have soared since Haniyeh’s assassination in Tehran last week. Iran and its allies blamed Israel, though Israel has not commented. Iran vows revenge after Hamas leader assassinated in TehranCalls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow The OIC convened in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Wednesday, at the request of Iranian and Palestinian officials. Acting Iranian Foreign Minister Baqeri Ali Bagheri Kani told members “it is expected” that they support Iran’s response to the killing. “Iran's action is not only a defence of its own sovereignty and national security but also a defence of the stability and security of the entire region,"" he said. A statement later released by the OIC said the bloc holds Israel ""fully responsible"" for the ""heinous attack"", which it described as ""a serious infringement"" of Iran's sovereignty. But it stopped short of endorsing any Iranian military action. In April, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel - nearly all of which were shot down - in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria. Many fear Iran's response on this occasion could take a similar form. OIC Chair Mamadou Tangara said Haniyeh’s killing had the potential to cause “a wider conflict that could involve the entire region"". The killing ""will not quell the Palestinian cause but rather it amplifies it,” he said. Saudi Arabia commented on the killing for the first time on Wednesday, with deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji calling it a ""blatant violation"" of Iran's sovereignty. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that the US hoped ""all parties that have a relationship with Iran impress upon Iran, the same way we've been impressing upon the government of Israel, that they shouldn't take any steps to escalate the conflict"". Miller said the US had been in contact with some members of the OIC and believed there is a ""broad consensus"" that ""escalation would only exacerbate the problems facing the region"". Diplomatic efforts have been ongoing since the start of the week, with US President Joe Biden speaking on the phone to the leaders of Jordan, Qatar and Egypt on Tuesday.

We communicated that message directly to Israel,"" US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Tuesday.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the comments while speaking to students on Saturday ahead of the 45th anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the US embassy in Tehran. The threat comes as Iran assesses whether and how to respond to Israel's attack last month, that Iran said killed four soldiers, which was in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack against Israel earlier in October. The Iranian attack came in response to the killings of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas - Iranian-backed armed groups fighting Israel - and a senior Iranian commander. Khamenei said Iran's enemies, including Israel and the US, ""will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran, the Iranian people, and the resistance front"". Iran's so-called ""axis of resistance"" is an alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states. Israel is said to have inflicted severe damage on Iranian air defences and missile capacities in its 26 October attack, even though Iran has not admitted this. Israel sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks which killed about 1,200 people on 7 October last year. More than 250 were also taken into the Gaza Strip as hostages. Since then, Israel has launched a major operation in Gaza, during which more than 43,300 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel also went on the offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon in September, after almost a year of cross-border fighting and rocket fire, which Hezbollah had launched in support of Palestinians the day after the Hamas attacks. Israel said it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents from northern Israel displaced by the conflict. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities.

3049,2024-09-23 10:18:41.150000+00:00,/news/articles/c3vkw7vg727o,"The President of Ireland Michael D Higgins has accused the Israeli Embassy in Dublin of circulating a letter he wrote to the President of Iran. The Israeli Embassy in Dublin has labelled Higgins' comments as ""baseless"", ""highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous"". The Irish president was criticised last month when the letter to Masoud Pezeshkian became public, following Pezeshkian's appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Speaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins said he believed that his letter had been circulated by Israeli officials. ""You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,"" Higgins said. Pressed by journalists as to where he believed the letter came from, Higgins said he believed ""it was circulated from the Israeli embassy"" in Dublin. Higgins said he wrote to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been some interest in re-starting nuclear talks with Iran. He told Pezeshkian that Iran had a ""crucial role"" in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. ""I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi,"" the letter read. The letter appeared in the Jewish Chronicle and prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. In a statement, the Israeli embassy said: ""Unfortunately in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred. ""This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely. ""The statement added that it is the ""burden of the author to defend its content,  which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region"". The spokesperson referenced the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on concert goers in Israel when about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 40,000 people have been killed in the territory because of Israel's response. A spokesperson for the Irish president's office said: ""The exchange of letters upon the coming to office of a new head of state is standard diplomatic practice for countries which share diplomatic relations. ""As is usual practice, the letter in question was drafted based on material supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and issued via standard diplomatic channels. Such letters have been sent to incoming presidents of Iran for a number of decades. ""In response to questions, the president indicated his view that this standard diplomatic letter had been circulated over the summer and presented as being something out of the ordinary. ""The president made no accusations of a leak, he solely referred to the letter being circulated. In this context, the question of reporting does not arise. "" The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris, also at the UN in New York, has defended the Irish president, stating his concerns was the loss of life in Gaza. Harris said that Israel ""is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue"". ""I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state,"" Harris said. ""Certainly, my focus here in New York is not on an exchange of letters, but is on the fact that there is still a horrific, bloody humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the middle east. ""I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,"" Harris added.",Irish president accuses Israeli embassy of Iran letter leak,Irish president accuses Israeli embassy of Iran letter leak,israel_and_the_palestinians,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vkw7vg727o,articles/article_3049.txt,results/article_3049.txt.json
3050,2024-08-18 15:00:53.516000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y3xzex72no,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to an American ""bridging proposal"" for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. It is now up to Hamas to agree, Mr Blinken added. The pair met in Tel Aviv for talks that Mr Netanyahu has described as ""positive"", with his office adding that he had reiterated his commitment to an American proposal on the release of the hostages still held by Hamas, which took into account Israel’s security needs. Mr Blinken had earlier warned this was ""maybe the last opportunity"" to secure a ceasefire agreement, as the US hopes to push a deal over the finish line. The Americans hope that could happen perhaps as soon as this time next week, but that level of optimism is not shared by the Israeli leadership or Hamas. Each accuses the other of obstinate cynicism, and blocking a deal. Speaking in Tel Aviv after the talks, Mr Blinken described ""the fierce urgency"" of progressing towards a truce and hostage release deal. ""We're never giving up"", he added, saying more delays could mean more hostages could die and further obstacles could hamper any agreement. The US secretary of state will now travel on to Egypt and then Qatar, to try and drive forward progress on a deal. Mr Netanyahu reportedly told Mr Blinken that he planned to send a negotiating team to Cairo later this week for a new round of talks with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators. Meanwhile, reports from Gaza speak of a worsening humanitarian situation amid continuing Israeli military activity. Israel said its aircraft and troops had killed “eliminated dozens of terrorists” over the past day and destroyed Hamas compounds and a tunnel network where rockets and missiles were found. Palestinian media reported that six people had been killed in an Israeli air strike near an internet access point near the southern city of Khan Younis on Monday, and that another four were killed in a strike on a car in Gaza City, in the north. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,130 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages during a week-long ceasefire in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. Mr Blinken was in Israel on Monday for a series of talks with key Israeli leaders. After one meeting - with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant - a large crowd of protesters outside could be heard chanting ""SOS USA, hostage deal now"" and ""Blinken we trust you, bring them home"". Some were holding pictures of hostages. That sense of urgency was in Mr Blinken's messages was clear. “This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” he said before talks with President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv. “I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line,” he added. “It is time for everyone to get to ‘yes’ and to not look for any excuses to say ‘no’. ”Speaking alongside him, President Herzog blamed what he called “the refusal of Hamas to move forward” with a deal. Mr Blinken then had a three-hour meeting in Jerusalem with Mr Netanyahu, whose office said was “positive and was held in a good atmosphere”. “The prime minister reiterated Israel's commitment to the current American proposal on the release of our hostages, which takes into account Israel's security needs, which he strongly insists on,” a brief statement added. On Sunday, the prime minister accused Hamas of being “completely obstinate” and insisted that “pressure needs to be directed” at the group - which Israel, the US and other countries proscribe as a terrorist organisation. A Qatar-based member of Hamas’s political bureau told the BBC on Monday that it was “still interested” in reaching a deal, although he said it would not be participating in the Cairo meetings. “We agreed a deal [through mediators] on 2 July. . . and therefore we don't need a new round of negotiations or to discuss the new demands of Benjamin Netanyahu,” Basem Naim said. “We have shown maximum flexibility and positivity and the other party has understood this as a weakness and met it with more force - he is not interested in reaching a ceasefire, only in flaring up the region. . . and serving his own personal political interests. ""The US is holding out hope that in the coming days, it can bridge the gaps on a ceasefire deal. However, that deadline is being imposed by Washington, rather than the warring parties. And the Israeli prime minister and the leaders of Hamas do not seem to feel that same sense of urgency. Their statements last night were very defiant, sticking to their positions and digging in. On Tuesday, Mr Blinken will fly from Israel to Egypt, which has been an important mediator along with Qatar and is able to pass messages directly to Hamas. The mediators announced last Friday that they had presented “a proposal that narrows the gaps between the parties” and was consistent with the principles set out by President Joe Biden on 31 May, which would run in three phases:• The first would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel• The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities""• The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remainsThe Americans have not provided details about bridging proposal, but major differences are said to remain on issues including Israel’s continuing military presence in Gaza, the rights of displaced Palestinians to move freely from north to south and the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners who’d be released from Israeli jails in exchange for Israeli hostages. Brett McGurk, one of the Biden administration’s key envoys in the region, has been working with the Egyptians over the past couple of weeks to address the sticking point of the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land that runs along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Mr Netanyahu says he insists that Israel will remain present there to stop smuggling and Hamas rearming.

3051,2024-08-08 22:37:19.965000+00:00,/news/articles/c07e99ver7ro,"Israel has agreed to send negotiators to a new round of talks over a ceasefire and hostage release deal, after a diplomatic push from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. The three nations released a joint statement on Thursday pushing for the talks to take place between Israel and Hamas on 15 August in Doha or Cairo. Hamas is yet to respond. The statement said a ""framework agreement"" was ready and that it had ""only the details of implementation left to conclude”. The push for new talks will be seen as an attempt by the US and its partners to stop regional tensions from spiralling out of control, after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week.  Iran, blaming Israel, has vowed a response - though Israel has not commented directly on the killing. The statement invited Israel and Hamas to restart talks ""to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay"". ""As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties,"" it said. The statement was signed by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. It said the ""framework agreement"" was based on “principles” previously outlined by President Biden on 31 May, external - which proposed a deal that would start with a full ceasefire and the release of a number of hostages. The UN Security Council, external endorsed that framework. European Union chief Ursula Von der Leyen said she “strongly” supported the efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement. ""We need a ceasefire in Gaza now. That's the only way to save lives, restore hope for peace, and secure the return of hostages,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK ""fully endorses"" the plan for talks, adding that it welcomed ""the tireless efforts of our partners in Qatar, Egypt and the United States"". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Thursday evening he had spoken with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to brief him on changes to US forces in the region and ""reinforce my ironclad support for Israel’s defence"". ""I also stressed the importance of concluding a ceasefire deal in Gaza that releases the hostages,"" he said. Despite numerous rounds of talks, the challenge of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release agreement has so far proved elusive. Hamas official Osama Hamdan said in June that the group was pushing for a “permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal [of Israeli troops] from the Gaza Strip” and a swap-deal involving Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said the conflict can only stop once Hamas is defeated. On Thursday, Israel continued its bombardment of the Gaza strip. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence force said it hit two schools, killing more than 18 people. The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas command centres. Any proposed talks could be made even more difficult by Hamas’ decision to elect Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, replacing Haniyeh. Sinwar, who Israel holds responsible for the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, is seen as one of the group's most extreme figures. Amid fears of an attack from Iran or its allies, Israel’s security cabinet met in an underground bunker on Thursday, instead of its usual meeting place, Israel’s Channel 13 reported.",Israel accepts proposal to attend ‘urgent’ new ceasefire talks,Israel accepts proposal to attend ‘urgent’ new ceasefire talks,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07e99ver7ro,articles/article_3051.txt,results/article_3051.txt.json
3052,2024-08-29 21:01:32.097000+00:00,/news/articles/cn02z5kjn40o,"Israel has agreed to a series of “humanitarian pauses” in Gaza to allow for the vaccination of children against polio, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. The campaign will aim to vaccinate around 640,000 children across the Gaza strip and will begin on Sunday, senior WHO official Rik Peeperkorn said. It will be rolled out in three separate stages, across the central, southern and northern parts of the strip. During each stage, fighting will pause for three consecutive days between 06:00 and 15:00 local time. The agreement comes days after UN officials said a 10-month-old baby had been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza’s first case of polio for 25 years. Around 1.26m doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are already in Gaza, with 400,000 additional doses set to arrive soon. The vaccinations will be carried out by UN staff and other local health workers. Over 2,000 health and community outreach personnel have been trained to administer the vaccine. Louise Wateridge, a UN spokeswoman in Gaza, has called for a ceasefire to allow the vaccination programme to run safely. ""We cannot vaccinate children under a sky full of bombs and strikes, we cannot vaccinate children who are fleeing for their lives,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. ""Any military operations during the time we are trying to roll out a vaccination campaign will affect our ability to deliver these vaccinations to children,"" she explained. Ms Wateridge said children will receive two oral doses this week, and will need a repeat vaccination four weeks later. The WHO is aiming to achieve 90% vaccine coverage across the strip, which is needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza. An agreement is in place for an additional fourth day of vaccination and humanitarian pause if needed to achieve that level of vaccination. Poliovirus is highly infectious and is most often spread through sewage and contaminated water. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. Polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% in 2022, although it had declined to 89% last year, according to the latest data. The Israeli military said in July it had begun vaccinating its soldiers against the disease. Hamas official Basem Naim told the Reuters news agency: ""We are ready to cooperate with international organisations to secure this campaign, serving and protecting more than 650,000 Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip. ""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the series of three-day pauses were ""not a ceasefire"". James Kariuki, UK deputy permanent representative to the UN, said he ""strongly"" welcomed the vaccination plan. ""We now need to see this in action and these pauses need to be long enough to deliver the 90% coverage required. When the campaign starts and thousands of vulnerable and unaccompanied children gather at vaccination sites, they must all be protected,"" he added. Prof Hagai Levine, a spokesman for the Hostages Families Forum - a group which is calling for more action to secure the release of Israeli hostages - urged health workers to ensure those still being held are included in the vaccination campaign. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

3053,2024-11-25 16:45:13.783000+00:00,/news/articles/c0rge45kw4jo,"Israel and Lebanon appear to be close to a ceasefire deal, with the Israeli cabinet set to meet on Tuesday to discuss it, Israeli and US officials say. A 60-day truce is being proposed to end fighting between Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah. It is said to include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and an end to the Hezbollah presence in the area. ""We believe we've reached this point where we're close,"" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. But he added, ""We're not there yet. "" The US and France - a long-term ally of Lebanon - have been involved in the search for a ceasefire. It is often said that the darkest hour is before the dawn. There has been an intensification in the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, just as the two sides haggle over the final details of the deal. Sunday saw around 250 projectiles fired into Israel from Lebanon, with most intercepted, while the Israeli Air Force has continued to carry out air strikes on suspected Hezbollah positions and weapons stores in Beirut and elsewhere. The deal would include an increase in the presence of the Lebanese army in the area vacated by Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have agreed to the deal ""in principle"" and Lebanese deputy parliament speaker Elias Bou Saab said, quoted by Reuters, that there were now ""no serious obstacles"" to a ceasefire. One major sticking point - who would monitor the truce - had been resolved, he said, with a five-country committee set up including France as a member and chaired by the US. Also holding up the deal has been Israel’s insistence on its right to go back into Lebanon and take whatever military action it decides is necessary if it believes Hezbollah is moving back into southern Lebanon south of the Litani River or preparing to launch an attack on Israel. This freedom of movement was unpalatable to both Hezbollah and the Lebanese government but Amos Hochstein, the US envoy, is believed to have made it clear, as he shuttled between the two countries, that there was a time limit on this ceasefire deal. Concerns over how a ceasefire would be enforced, given the comparative weakness of both the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) and the Lebanese Army, appear to have been allayed. But then there is the domestic Israeli factor. The hard right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, has taken to social media to voice his opposition to a ceasefire deal, calling it ""a grave mistake"". He said that now, with Hezbollah on the back foot militarily, was ""a historic opportunity"" to destroy it. The hostilities began on 8 October last year, as Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel in support of Hamas in Gaza. Israel’s stated goal in its war against Hezbollah - which intensified in September - is to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who have been displaced from communities in northern Israel because of the group’s attacks. It was then that it launched a major offensive against the militia, destroying much of its infrastructure and weapons, and killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior figures. Lebanese authorities have said any ceasefire deal should be limited to the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution includes the withdrawal of Hezbollah’s fighters and weapons in areas between the Blue Line - the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the boundary with Israel. Israel says that was never fully respected, while Lebanon says Israeli violations included military flights over Lebanese territory. In Lebanon, more than 3,750 people have been killed and at least 15,600 injured since October 2023, according to Lebanese authorities, with more than one million forced from their homes. Several people were injured and buildings damaged in Hezbollah's Sunday attacks on northern and central Israel, some of them near Tel Aviv, Israel's police said. The attacks followed an Israeli air strike on central Beirut on Saturday, in which the Lebanese health ministry said 29 people were killed. Hostilities continued on Monday, with Lebanon's health ministry saying Israeli air strikes killed at least 31 people, according to news agency AFP. Israel also carried out multiple attacks on Beirut's southern suburbs, saying it was targeting buildings linked to Hezbollah.",Israel and Hezbollah close to Lebanon ceasefire deal,Israel and Hezbollah close to Lebanon ceasefire deal,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0rge45kw4jo,articles/article_3053.txt,results/article_3053.txt.json
3054,2024-08-25 03:23:44.008000+00:00,/news/articles/cq6rzvyz9p6o,"Israel has said it carried out a wave of pre-emptive strikes across southern Lebanon to thwart a large-scale rocket and drone attack by Hezbollah. Jets destroyed thousands of the Iran-backed armed group’s rocket launchers on Sunday morning, Israel's military said. Hezbollah and its Amal allies said three fighters had been killed. Hezbollah said it had still managed to fire 320 rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander. According to Israel's military, one  Israeli navy soldier was killed. The US says it is working to avoid any further escalation after 10 months of hostilities that have raised fears of an all-out war. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. There was no breakthrough at the latest round of US-backed Gaza peace talks in Cairo. Before leaving, Hamas said it rejected new Israeli conditions and accused Israel of backtracking on promises. Israel denies changing its demands since a last round of talks in early July. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group, which is also backed by Iran. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Since October, more than 560 people have been reported killed according to Lebanon's health ministry, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, while 26 civilians and 23 soldiers have been killed in Israel, authorities report. The UN says almost 200,000 people have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Israel's attack on Hezbollah at around 04:30 (01:30 GMT) on Sunday was its biggest since the full-scale war between them in 2006. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 100 fighter jets had “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” in more than 40 areas of southern Lebanon. The strikes went ahead after ""extensive preparation"" for a large-scale aerial attack by Hezbollah was detected, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli aircraft had struck Beaufort Castle, the Bir Kalb area, and the outskirts of the towns of Ain Qana, Kfar Fila, Louaizeh, Bsalia, Kfar Melki, Sajd and Sarba. A resident of the town of Zibqeen said it had “felt like the apocalypse”. What is Hezbollah?One person was killed in a drone strike on a car in Khiam, the Lebanese ministry of public health said. The Amal movement said one of its fighters from the village had been killed. The ministry also said an Israeli attack on the village of Tiri had killed two people. Hezbollah confirmed the deaths of two fighters from nearby Haris, without providing any details. ""What happened today is not the end of the story,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting. As well as destroying short-range rockets, Mr Netanyahu said, the IDF intercepted all of the drones which Hezbollah had “launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”. “[Sheikh Hassan] Nasrallah in Beirut and [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north,” he warned the leaders of Hezbollah and Iran. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had told dozens of his counterparts worldwide that Israel did “not seek a full-scale war” but would “do whatever it takes to protect our citizens”. Not long after the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah said it had targeted and hit 11 Israeli military facilities in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights with more than 320 Katyusha rockets. It described the barrage as a response to the assassination of senior military commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on 30 July. The group said the operation had been “completed and accomplished” and it dismissed as ""empty"" Israel’s statements that its strikes on Sunday had thwarted a larger attack. Video footage showed explosions in the sky as incoming rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. Later, the IDF announced that an Israeli Navy soldier had fallen ""during combat in northern Israel"", without providing further details. Israeli media say he was killed in an incident involving a Hezbollah drone and an Iron Dome interceptor in the vicinity of a Dvora patrol boat, about 4km from the Lebanese border. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address on Sunday evening that the group had targeted a military intelligence base about 110km (68 miles) into Israeli territory, which was only 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from Tel Aviv. He said Hezbollah had been able to carry out its attack as planned, and all drones had been launched successfully, entering Israeli airspace, according to a Reuters translation. He warned that the group would respond again if the results were deemed to be not enough. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati - whose government has little influence over Hezbollah - said he was “holding a series of contacts with Lebanon’s friends to stop the escalation”. He called for a halt to the “Israeli aggression” and the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution which ended the 2006 war. Mr Mikati also emphasised Lebanon’s support for international efforts to broker a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the hope was that the latest fighting would not lead to a regional war.

The Israeli military says around 100 fighter jets carried out what it described as pre-emptive strikes on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon on Sunday morning. Hezbollah later fired rockets and missiles into northern Israel. If that 100 figure is correct, it would be the largest Israeli attack on Lebanon since the full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israel's strikes happened at around 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT), and it said that Hezbollah was planning a large-scale attack half an hour later, at 05:00 local time. According to reporting by the New York Times, quoting an anonymous Israeli intelligence official, this included rocket strikes on Tel Aviv, the country’s biggest city, deep inside central Israel. In the end Hezbollah said it had fired more than 300 rockets and missiles targeting military facilities in northern Israel, where air raid sirens have been sounding. Across the region, the fear is this latest escalation could once again lead to all-out war. FOLLOW LIVE: Latest updates after strikes from Israel and Hezbollah In a statement, Hezbollah said this was the first phase of its response to the Israeli assassination of a senior commander Fouad Shukr in a strike in Beirut on 30 July. It is widely believed Israel was behind the assassination of the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in a strike in the Iranian capital Tehran the following day. Ever since, the region has been waiting for a response from both Hezbollah and Iran. From Iran, it is yet to come. But this appears to be Hezbollah’s first significant retaliation. For weeks now diplomats have been working to try to avoid the crisis in Gaza escalating into a wider regional conflict. The United States has warned the ongoing failure to agree a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas could see those diplomatic efforts fail. But despite intense US pressure, talks to establish a ceasefire deal for Gaza after more than 10 months of war have led to nothing. Israel’s military says it is ready to fight a war on two fronts: in Gaza and on its northern border with Lebanon. But Hezbollah is a far more formidable force than Hamas. It’s estimated it has around 150,000 rockets, some capable of reaching targets across Israel. Its fighters, some of whom have fought in the war in Syria, are well trained and better equipped than those of Hamas. Almost a year into the conflict in Gaza, some question whether there is appetite in Israel for another war. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli army reservists have been called up to fight in Gaza, often serving several tours. But many Israelis, especially those from the north, say Hezbollah needs to be dealt with. Tens of thousands of people living there have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the war in Gaza. Many have lost their businesses. In southern Lebanon too, tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes because of fears of Israeli strikes. Hezbollah, for now, has said it has concluded the first phase of its retaliation for the killing of Fouad Shukr. Its strikes on Israel this morning appear to have caused relatively little damage and there have been few casualties on either side. Israel believes it successfully thwarted a major Hezbollah attack. The question becomes: will we now see a return to the more routine cross-border ""tit for tat"" that has been going on since the start of the war in Gaza last October?Or could today's violence escalate into something far more dangerous?Israeli and Hezbollah leaders say they do not want another full-scale war.

They were also tasked with bombing a police car and throwing a grenade at a house, for a payment of some 200,000 shekels (£40,700; $53,000), authorities said. News of the detentions comes a day after Israeli security services announced that seven Israelis had been arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran.  Iran is Israel's arch-foe and tensions between the two countries are at their highest for years. Israel has pledged to retaliate against an Iranian missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The statement said the group was led by a 23-year-old man, who had allegedly been recruited as an Iranian operative. The leader is said to have recruited the six other suspects. Local media said the man had confessed to carrying out ""terrorist activity"" for nationalistic reasons. The Shin Bet and police statement said: ""Scientists, mayors, security officials, and other prominent Israelis are targets for Iranian agents. ""This investigation underscores Iran’s efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for terrorism. ""Israeli security agencies will continue collaborating to detect Iranian activities and prosecute those involved. "" News of the arrests came hours after authorities said seven Israeli Jewish citizens had been arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran. The seven - who had immigrated from Azerbaijan - were detained in the Haifa area. They are suspected of carrying out about 600 espionage missions, including passing on intelligence about military sites and energy infrastructure. Last week, four Israeli soldiers were killed in a drone attack by Iran's ally Hezbollah on an army base near Binyamina in northern Israel. The base was among the sites which the group had spied on, security services say. While Iranian attempts to recruit local operatives is not unusual, the alleged recruitment of Israeli Jews is very rare. A statement from the Shin Bet and police said those arrested were “well aware” that the intelligence they provided compromised national security and could potentially aid enemy missile attacks. They were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the information said police, who also described it as one of the most serious cases yet uncovered. The latest arrests come amid stepped up overt and covert activity between Israel and Iran, including intelligence and sabotage operations in each other's countries. Israel is believed to have penetrated Iranian security services, resulting in attacks and assassinations. Iran occasionally announces arrests of alleged Israeli intelligence agents and the breaking up of alleged Israeli spy cells, though without providing substantial evidence.

3058,2024-10-11 07:14:05.385000+00:00,/news/articles/cy0g2ge1k81o,"The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris has described Israel’s attack on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon as a breach of international law. Speaking to BBC News in Washington DC, Harris said it was an ""extraordinarily concerning development"". The IDF has acknowledged that its troops ""opened fire in the area"" of the base in Naqoura on Thursday after instructing UN troops to ""remain in protected spaces"". Ireland has 379 troops in Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission. None were hurt in recent attacks, but two Indonesian soldiers were injured on Thursday. Two other peacekeepers were injured in a separate explosion on Friday which the IDF has said it is investigating. The taoiseach described attacks on three United Nations Interim Force positions in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as ""really dangerous, despicable attacks on peacekeepers"". He added that the IDF had positioned themselves at a UNIFIL outpost which was being manned by about 30 Irish peacekeepers, but had since moved following UN and US intervention. The taoiseach said that he was protesting ""at the highest levels"" in relation to the attack, and said that the United Nations, and all of the countries making up the peacekeeping mission should ""speak with one voice"" about what he called Israel's breach of international law. However, he said he was concerned that ""Israel doesn't listen"". Harris added that Israel had ""a right to defend itself, a right to live in peace and security"" and that no-one disputed that but that “international law has to be followed, and proportionality also has to be due”. He said neither of those tests were currently being met. He said he had spoken to the US President Joe Biden twice in recent days, including at an hour-long meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said he had also spoken to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres about the matter. On Friday UNIFIL reported that two more peacekeeping troops had been hurt in two explosions near the Naqoura base. The IDF said Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon had identified a threat and responded with fire. The Israeli military said it had struck the UNIFIL post, which was about 50m away from the source of the threat. It said it had earlier told UNIFIL troops to stay in a protected space and added that it was continuing to examine the incident. The UK government has said it is “appalled” by reports that Israel deliberately fired on the base. US President Joe Biden has asked Israel not to hit UN peacekeepers while carrying out operations against Hezbollah, and France, Italy and Spain released a joint statement, saying attacks on peacekeepers are ""unjustifiable and should immediately come to an end"". In an evening update, the Irish Defence Forces confirmed all personnel ""are well and accounted for"". Israel has requested that the UNIFIL peacekeepers withdraw from southern Lebanon, but the taoiseach rejected that. He said: “We cannot have a situation where aggression can force a peacekeeping mission to leave. "" Harris said the IDF and Hezbollah needed to “respect the role of our peacekeepers” and what was needed was an “urgent de-escalation” and a ceasefire. Irish Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Seán Clancy described attacks on UN peacekeepers as an ""egregious violation"". He said the Israeli military needs to be held accountable as their actions were ""reckless"" and cannot be tolerated. Lt Gen Clancy told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that he did not believe the Israeli claim that the strikes were inadvertent. ""From a military perspective this is not an accidental act. It is a direct act,"" he said. ""Whether its indiscipline or directed, either way it is not conscionable or allowable. "" On Friday evening, the head of UN Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix said there is reason to believe some of Israel's firing at peacekeepers in Lebanon was direct. “We have reason to believe that in some cases the firing has been direct,"" he told BBC's Newshour programme. ""For example we have a case where a tower was hit by a fire and also damages to cameras at one of the positions – which obviously to us very much looked like direct fire. ""Lacroix added that parties involved in the conflict had obligations to respect peacekeepers safety. ""There is a risk for more of this incident, and it is highly important to keep conveying these messages. . . the idea to all parties that peacekeepers need to be respected. ""On Harris's earlier remarks, Mr Lacroix told BBC News: ""Certainly the firing against peacekeepers position is in violation of international obligation. That is absolutely clear. ""He added that although the peacekeepers are in ""difficult and dangerous conditions"", they have made a ""considerate decision"" to remain situated in position and fulfill their mandates. Israel alleges that that the UN has failed to enforce the 1701 resolution which called for a demilitarised zone and the disarmament of Hezbollah and this was partly to blame for the current conflict. For its part, UNIFIL has said Israel's ground invasion of southern Lebanon constitutes a violation of resolution 1701. Harris said: “It’s very hard to take a lecture from Israel in terms of holding UN resolution right now, or indeed international law, when we’ve seen completely disproportionate war and the impact that that has had from the humanitarian crisis point of view of civilians, including children. ""The taoiseach said there were “significant lessons” that could be learned from the Northern Ireland peace process, and the first was to “never allow the world to believe that a terrorist organisation is the same as a country”. Ireland is one of several European countries that has recognised the state of Palestine. The taoiseach said it took that decision because “we know Palestine is not Hamas"". He said: ""Hamas is a despicable, disgusting terrorist organisation that should be condemned outright by all right thinking people, but we know what it's like in Ireland to have efforts to hijack and sabotage your national identity and your flag by terrorists, and we can never stand for that.

3059,2024-11-28 14:51:35.927000+00:00,/news/articles/cp8x324vr0mo,"Israel is creating a new military dividing line in Gaza, separating off the far north of the strip, satellite images studied by BBC Verify appear to show. Troops are in control of, and are clearing, an area across the width of north Gaza. Satellite images and videos show that hundreds of buildings have been demolished between the Mediterranean Sea and the Israel border, mostly through controlled explosions. Images also show Israeli troops and vehicles have been stationed across the new divide. Analysts said the images suggest Gaza is being split into zones to make it easier to control. An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it was ""targeting terrorist operatives and infrastructure"" in north Gaza. Dr H A Hellyer, a Middle East security expert from the Rusi think tank, said the satellite images suggested Israel was preparing to block Palestinian civilians from returning to the north Gaza governorate. More than 100,000 people have already been displaced from the far north of Gaza, according to the UN. Images appear to show two long sections of road on either end of the strip being connected by cleared land through an urban area. Buildings are being demolished between the two sections of road, with a clear pattern visible since early October. This partition stretches about 5.6 miles (9km) across Gaza, from east to west, dividing Gaza City and the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in north Gaza. The BBC has been told that there is a tactical route between Jabalia and Gaza City, which is part of operational activities targeting Hamas in Jabalia. Videos filmed by the IDF and posted online show several multi-storey buildings being destroyed in controlled explosions since the beginning of October. The graphic below shows examples geolocated by BBC Verify along the new corridor. An IDF spokesperson told the BBC that it had no intention of destroying civilian infrastructure ""without operational necessity"" to neutralise Hamas. Other footage shows IDF Humvee vehicles being driven through the cleared area from the direction of Israel. Humvees are not as heavily armoured as other military vehicles - and Dr Hellyer told the BBC that they were unlikely to be used unless the military was confident about their safety, indicating that Israeli troops are in control of the area. Some analysts believe the IDF’s presence could indicate a permanent military partition – giving it control of who can travel between the Gaza and the North Gaza governorates. Dr Hellyer said of the IDF: “They’re digging in for the long term. I would absolutely expect the north partition to develop exactly like the Netzarim Corridor. ”The BBC has previously documented how two partitions have been constructed in Gaza since the start of the current war. The Netzarim Corridor splits an area south of Gaza City, while the Philadelphi Corridor gives the IDF control of land running the length of Gaza’s border with Egypt. BBC analysis of this new partition in the north shows a similar pattern to the construction of the previous corridors over the past year, with existing and newly built roads being connected and military positions emerging at regular intervals. Buildings and agricultural land are cleared so roads can be paved and military infrastructure built. Dr Eado Hecht from the Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (Besa), an Israeli think tank specialising in national security and foreign policy, agreed that the data showed a new dividing line, but questioned whether it was designed to be permanent. “There is a new partition corridor separating Gaza City and the northern towns of the Gaza Strip. The goal is to cut off the Hamas - and other organizations' - forces that have returned to that area from support and the ability to retreat, so they can be dealt with more effectively. ”Israel has denied that it is implementing the ""General’s Plan"". Under the strategy, devised by former general Giora EIland, civilians would be told to leave the north, supplies would be blocked and the area would become a military zone. Those who remained would be treated as combatants and faced with the choice of “surrender or starve"", with the aim of putting pressure on Hamas to release its hostages. In a statement to the BBC, an IDF spokesperson said: ""The IDF operates according to well-established military plans, and the claim that the IDF is implementing this specific plan is incorrect. ""But concerns have mounted over the safety of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who remain in besieged towns in north Gaza. The UN and aid charities have raised significant concerns about the situation in the north of Gaza. While thousands of people have been displaced, the UN says over 65,000 people could remain in the area. The UN also said that ""virtually no aid"" has entered parts of the North Gaza governorate in 40 days on 20 November. A spokesperson on 26 November said that Palestinians were facing “facing critical shortages of supplies and services, as well as severe overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions” due to the blockade. Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in the besieged areas of northern Gaza. BBC analysis shows around 90% of north Gaza has been subject to evacuation orders since the start of October. Videos posted on social media document people being moved south of the new partition. It is not clear if and when they will be able to return, but Israel’s foreign minister has insisted civilians will be allowed to return after the war. Satellite images show the displacement of people in north Gaza. Large groups of tents, erected as temporary shelter, disappear. In the area left behind, there are often destroyed buildings and other examples of military activity. While the IDF appears to have established enough control in the area to travel in lightly armoured vehicles, heavy fighting has also persisted in the area between IDF troops and Hamas fighters. Videos posted by Hamas fighters show clashes with IDF tanks in the area around the dividing line. Experts disagree over how long the new partition might be intended to remain in place. Dr Hellyer suggested that it could form the basis of plan to expel Palestinians from the area permanently. ""Personally I think they're going to settle Jewish settlers in the north, probably in the next 18 months,"" he said. ""They won't call them settlements. To begin with they'll call them outposts or whatever, but that's what they'll be and they'll grow from there. ""Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said that troops should occupy Gaza and ""encourage"" about half of Palestinian civilians to leave the territory within two years. But the Israeli government denies that it plans to build settlements in Gaza once the war ends, and Dr Hecht dismissed such suggestions as nothing more than a ""dream"" for some ultranationalist ministers. ""All three corridors (Philadelphi in the south, Netzarim just south of Gaza City and the new one just north of Gaza City) are for control purposes,"" Dr Hecht said. ""The duration of their existence depends on when the war ends and in what manner it ends. ” What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

3060,2024-07-30 21:44:41.889000+00:00,/news/articles/c1rwxyjydlyo,"Israel says it has killed a top Hezbollah commander after carrying out an air strike on a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. The Israeli military says Fuad Shukr was the target of an ""intelligence-based elimination"". Hezbollah has not yet confirmed his death, but says Shukr was in a building that was hit at the time. Israeli officials say he was responsible for a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday which killed 12 people, mostly children. Hezbollah has denied any involvement in that attack. In a statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said the rubble was still being removed from the site of the building in Daniyeh - a stronghold of the armed group which was ""still waiting for the result"". It said a number of people had been killed in the attack. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned ""blatant Israeli aggression"". He described it as a ""criminal act"" in a ""series of aggressive operations killing civilians in clear and explicit violation of international law. ""In a brief post on social media after the attack, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: ""Hezbollah crossed the red line"". An Israeli official has confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Israel gave the US notice of its Beirut strike. Fuad Shukr is believed to be a senior adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, the US has previously said. It has been offering a $5m (3.9m) reward for information about him, alleging he also played a ""central role"" in the 1983 bombing of a US Marines barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 US military personnel. Haret Hreik, the area of Dahiyeh hit by the air strike, is densely populated and strongly fortified. Dahiyeh itself is surrounded by Hezbollah checkpoints. Speaking after the Israeli strike, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that US President Joe Biden believed a wider war between Israel and Hezbollah could be avoided. ""We do not want to see an escalation, we do not want to see an all-out war,"" she said. Earlier in the day, two unnamed Israeli officials told Reuters news agency that while Israel sought to hurt Hezbollah, it did not want to drag Lebanon into all-out war. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) later said there would be no new instructions for Israelis on taking shelter, suggesting they did not anticipate an immediate or significant Hezbollah reaction. Both sides are aware of the cost of all-out war, which could bring in Iran in support of its Lebanese proxy. An Israeli reaction had been widely expected after the deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, and Israel's security cabinet had authorised Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant to decide how to retaliate. At least 12 people were killed - mostly children - when a rocket hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams on Saturday. Israel has blamed Hezbollah, but the group denies any involvement. It was the deadliest incident near the Israel-Lebanon border since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. That escalation came after Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October. Hezbollah - which supports Hamas - opened up a limited second front in Israel's north, and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. Recent days have seen world leaders urge restraint over fears of an all-out war. On Tuesday the UK foreign secretary told UK nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately or risk ""becoming trapped in a warzone"". David Lammy has arrived in Qatar along with Defence Secretary John Healey ""to ""drive forward efforts to bring the conflict in Gaza to an end and to press for de-escalation in the region"", the Foreign Office said. He said escalation and destabilisation were ""in no-one's interests"", adding: “It is absolutely vital that we engage closely with partners like Qatar, who play a key role in mediating the conflict in Gaza, so that we can bring this devastating war to an end.

3062,2024-11-12 11:49:01.301000+00:00,/news/articles/c8rl0v76nxyo,"The main UN aid agency in Gaza says Israel has failed to meet a US deadline to boost aid to the territory or risk a reduction in American military aid. Last month, in a strongly worded letter, the US secretary of state gave Israel an ultimatum of 30 days to ensure more aid trucks reached Gaza daily. The deadline expires on Tuesday. The amount of aid getting into Gaza is at its lowest level in a year, the UN says. A UN-backed report recently warned that there was an imminent likelihood of famine in northern Gaza, where hardly any aid has entered in the past month. Israel says it has substantially increased the amount of aid getting into Gaza, and accuses aid agencies of failing to adequately distribute it. In his letter on 13 October, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel needed to allow a minimum of 350 lorries a day into Gaza, every day, by 12 November. But when asked if Israel had done enough since then to meet America’s demands, Louise Wateridge, Senior Emergency Coordinator there for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), bluntly said “No”. “There is not enough aid here. There are not enough supplies,” she told the BBC from Unrwa's base in central Gaza. “People are starving in some areas. People are very hungry. They are fighting over bags of flour. There are just not enough supplies. ” In footage filmed for the BBC by a local journalist in Gaza at one of the few remaining bakeries in the centre of the strip, a stream of hot puffed-up pitas roll out of an oven on a conveyor belt. Through a small square window, hands desperately grasp at the bags of bread as money is handed over. Like all food, the price of bread has increased dramatically over the past year. Outside the bakery, hundreds of packed people scramble to get their hands on the bread. Among them is grandmother, Aida al-Horan, who has also been picking up soup. “If it were not for the soup kitchen, we would have starved to death,"" Aida says. “Every day it’s the same struggle. I go back and forth to the soup kitchen. ” But over the past month, Israel has met America’s request to open up more crossings into Gaza. Cogat – the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in the Gaza Strip – announced on Tuesday morning that it had opened a new crossing, Kissufim, towards the south. A spokesman for Cogat told the BBC that “most aspects [of Blinken’s demands] have been met and those which have not are being discussed, [and] some US demands are for issues that were being resolved already”. At Zikim, on the Israeli side of the strip’s northern border, I get as close as I’ve been to Gaza in more than 10 years. I was the BBC’s Gaza correspondent between 2009 and 2013 and know the strip well. But throughout this war, Israel has not allowed international journalists unrestricted access to Gaza. Zikim is one of a number of crossings which have been reopened by Israel in recent weeks. At a photocall on Monday, arranged by Israel’s military, a day before the US deadline, I and other journalists were invited to film around eight aid trucks passing into Gaza. They were laden with sacks of flour, rice and toilet paper, among other things. So, aid is getting into Gaza. But nowhere near enough. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says, over the past, month the average number of trucks getting into the strip is just over 40 trucks per day. Israel disputes Ocha's figures and blames the UN for failing to deliver aid. It says hundreds of pallets of supplies are waiting to be picked up by aid agencies on the Gaza side of the border and says some aid trucks are being looted by armed men. The UN rejects that. It says it is Israel’s responsibility as the occupying power to facilitate the safe passage of aid inside Gaza. It stresses that it cannot distribute aid if Israel’s military operations mean it is too dangerous. For more than a year Israel has crossed most of America’s red lines. Much of the death and destruction was caused by US weapons, given to Israel in order the help the fight against Hamas after the 7 October 2023, attack. But in the dying days of the Biden Presidency and with more than 43,000 Palestinian lives lost, it’s unlikely the White House will put its foot down and cut off arms supplies.","Israel has missed US deadline to boost Gaza aid, UN agency says","Israel has missed US deadline to boost Gaza aid, UN agency says","israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rl0v76nxyo,articles/article_3062.txt,results/article_3062.txt.json

It was published,” Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament. “There is a specific component in their nuclear programme that was hit. ”He gave no details, but last week Axios reported that a “nuclear weapons research facility” making plastic explosives at the Parchin military complex was destroyed, external. There was no immediate comment from Iran, but it has previously said the Israeli strikes caused limited damage to radar systems and that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. Iran has also insisted that it does not seek nuclear weapons, although evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggests that until 2003 it conducted activities relevant to the development of a bomb. The agency says Iran has not yet answered outstanding questions related to its nuclear activity.  The IAEA also says Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons since the US abandoned a nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions six years ago with Netanyahu’s support. On 26 October, the Israeli military announced it had conducted “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” in response to the 1 October attack that saw almost 200 ballistic missiles launched towards Israel. The military said the targets included missile manufacturing facilities, as well as surface-to-air missile arrays and aerial capabilities intended to restrict Israel’s freedom of operation inside Iran. Iran’s military said the attacks caused “limited and minor damage” to several radar systems and that four Iranian military officers and one civilian were killed. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the effect of the attacks should not be “magnified or downplayed”. Satellite images analysed by the BBC showed damage to four structures at Parchin, about 30km (18.5 miles) east of Tehran. Experts from the Institute for Science and International Security said three of the structures were related to missile production, and that the fourth, known as Taleghan 2, was previously involved in high explosive testing related to the development of nuclear weapons, external. Axios’s report cited unnamed US and Israeli officials as saying that intelligence services had detected recent activity at the Taleghan 2 facility that was “part of an effort inside the Iranian government to conduct research that could be used for the development of nuclear weapons but could also be presented as research for civilian purposes”. One former Israeli official said the strike destroyed “sophisticated equipment used to design the plastic explosives that surround uranium in a nuclear device and are needed to detonate it”, according to the report. Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel’s parliament that “a nuclear Iran poses a massive threat to our existence, to the peace agreements we aim to achieve with more of our neighbours and to global peace”. “We will be tested on our ability to thwart their nuclear ambitions,” he added. He then mentioned the attack on the “specific component” of Iran’s nuclear programme before warning that the “programme itself, its capacity to act here, has not yet been thwarted”. Before the Israeli strikes took place, US President Joe Biden had said publicly that he did not support attacks on Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities. President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to take a harder line with Iran when he takes office in January, meanwhile said he had advised Netanyahu to “hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later”. Last week, Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian told the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, that Iran was committed to resolving “doubts and ambiguities” surrounding its nuclear activities. Mr Grossi visited Tehran ahead of a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors this week, at which the UK, France and Germany are expected to pass a resolution critical of Iran’s co-operation. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned that Tehran would ""take countermeasures and new actions in our nuclear programme"" in response to any such resolution. He also strongly denied media reports that Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeed Iravani, had met Trump ally Elon Musk to defuse US-Iran tensions. “We are still waiting for the new US administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,"" he said.","Israel hit part of Iran's nuclear programme, Netanyahu says","Israel hit part of Iran's nuclear programme, Netanyahu says",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0l1ep34pro,articles/article_3063.txt,results/article_3063.txt.json
3064,2024-07-27 17:14:56.561000+00:00,/news/articles/c29dydz84ngo,"Israel says it has hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after 12 children and young adults were killed in a rocket strike while playing football in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The country's air force has blamed the Iran-backed militant group for Saturday's strike on the Druze town of Majdal Shams, but Hezbollah has strongly denied any involvement. Early on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had conducted air strikes against seven Hezbollah targets ""deep inside Lebanese territory"". It is unclear whether there were any casualties. The rising tensions have the potential to trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. Their forces have regularly exchanged fire since 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, triggering Israel's military offensive on Gaza. Saturday's bloodshed at the town's football pitch was the deadliest loss of life in and around Israel's northern border since October. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which had previously been sporadic, escalated when the militant group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attack, in solidarity with Palestinians. Israel's foreign ministry released the identities of 10 children killed in Saturday's strike, saying they were aged between 10 and 16. An eleventh person was named but no age was given. Details of the twelfth casualty were not confirmed. Verified video shows crowds of people on a football pitch and stretchers being rushed to ambulances. Majdal Shams is one of four towns in the Golan Heights, where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. On Sunday, thousands of people gathered in the town for the funerals of those killed. LIVE: Fears of full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah after strike kills children in Golan Heights Hezbollah spokesman Mohamad Afif denied responsibility for Saturday's strike in the Golan Heights. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation immediately after it happened, saying the group would ""pay a heavy price"". Hours later, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) said it had struck ""terror targets"" including ""weapons caches and terrorist infrastructure"" overnight. Before reports of the strike's impact emerged, Hezbollah had claimed responsibility for four other attacks. One was on a nearby military compound on the slopes of Mount Hermon, which lies on the border between the Golan Heights and Lebanon. The base is around 3km (2 miles) from the football pitch. Golan Heights profileReport: Israel and Hezbollah edge closer to all-out warIn maps: Damage, destruction and fear along the Israel-Lebanon border IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari, who visited the scene of the air strike, accused Hezbollah of ""lying and denying responsibility for the incident"". He said that the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1 ""owned exclusively by Hezbollah"". ""Our intelligence is clear,"" he said. ""Hezbollah is responsible for the murder of innocent children. ""Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the leader of the Druze community in the area, said the ""horrific massacre"" had crossed ""every possible red line"". Meanwhile, Iran warned Israel that any new military ""adventures"" in Lebanon could lead to ""unforeseen consequences"", said Nasser Kanani, a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry, according to AFP. The air strike prompted Mr Netanyahu, who was visiting the United States, to return home early. His plane landed in Israel on Sunday.  International leaders condemned the strike and cautioned against escalation, but differed on who was responsible. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Sunday: ""Every indication is that indeed the rocket was from Hezbollah. "" He said the US stands by ""Israel's right to defend"" itself, but does not want to see the conflict spreading. Lebanon's government also issued a rare statement in response to the strike, saying it ""condemns all acts of violence and aggression against all civilians and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts"". ""Targeting civilians is a flagrant violation of international law and goes against the principles of humanity,"" the statement added. The Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the BBC that he did not think Hezbollah carried out the attack. “I don’t think Hezbollah would do it”, he said, explaining the group usually hits military targets, not civilian targets. But he added “it could be a mistake by the Israelis or by Hezbollah – I don’t know”. ""We are talking with Hezbollah because the victims are Druze and the Druze community here [in Lebanon] cares about them a lot. We are asking Hezbollah not to retaliate at this present time”, Mr Bouhabib said. A United Nations statement, external said ""maximum restraint"" was crucial from all parties as the risk of a wider conflict would ""engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief"". In Majdal Shams on Sunday, where bloodstains remained on the astroturf pitch, locals expressed grief, anger and worry. Fighting back tears, Ugarit Abu Assad, 26, from nearby Buqata, told the BBC she feared a major escalation. “I’m afraid of the consequences of all out war,” she said, adding that ""a lot of people"" could die. Most Druze live in northern Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. In Israel, they have full citizenship rights and comprise about 1.5% of the population. Those living in the Golan were offered Israeli citizenship when the region was annexed from Syria in 1981, but not everyone accepted. Druze in the Golan can still study and work in Israel, though only those with citizenship can vote. Male Israeli Druze are required to serve in the army. They are the largest non-Jewish group in the IDF. The vast majority of the international community does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.

3065,2024-09-20 14:35:19.485000+00:00,/news/articles/cn8jg0x5xg8o,"Israel's military has launched an investigation after its soldiers were filmed throwing the bodies of three dead Palestinians off a rooftop during a raid in the occupied West Bank. Footage of the incident, filmed in the northern town of Qabatiya, near Jenin, then appears to show an Israeli military bulldozer picking up and removing the bodies. The images have sparked widespread outrage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that it was “a serious incident” that did not “conform” to its values and what was expected of its forces. Local Palestinian officials say at least seven people were killed by Israeli forces in Qabatiya on Thursday. Under international law, soldiers are obliged to ensure that bodies, including those of enemy fighters, are treated with respect. The IDF said it carried out a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya, during which  four militants were killed in an ""exchange of fire"" and three others were killed after a drone strike on a car. A journalist in Qabatiya told the BBC that on Thursday morning Israeli troops had surrounded a building in town. He described how four men who were in the house then escaped to the roof and were shot by snipers. Fighting continued in the town and when it had subsided, he then said he saw Israeli troops go up to the roof and drop the bodies down over the side, where they were then loaded onto a bulldozer. Asked about the incident shown in the footage, the IDF said: ""This is a serious incident that does not conform with [our] values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. The incident is under review. ""The military said that one of those killed in Qabatiya was Shadi Zakarneh, who it identified as being ""responsible for directing and carrying out attacks in the northern West Bank area"". It said he was ""the head of the terrorist organisation"" in Qabatiya but did not specify which group he belonged to. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, in the West Bank, described the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter, as a ""crime"" which exposed the ""brutality"" of the Israeli army. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby described the footage as ""deeply disturbing"". ""If it's proven to be authentic, it clearly would depict abhorrent and egregious behaviour by professional soldiers,"" he told reporters. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 690 Palestinians have been killed there since then, the Palestinian health ministry says, as Israeli forces have intensified their nearly daily search and arrest raids. Israel says it is trying to stem Palestinian attacks in the West Bank and Israel, in which at least 33 Israelis have been killed. In Gaza, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Israel investigates after its soldiers filmed throwing bodies off roof,Israel investigates after its soldiers filmed throwing bodies off roof,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn8jg0x5xg8o,articles/article_3065.txt,results/article_3065.txt.json

The woman's identity was not revealed by Hamas, and it was unclear how or when she is said to have died. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was currently unable to “verify or refute” the claim, but that its representatives are in contact with the woman's family. “This evening the terrorist organization Hamas released a document in which a kidnapped woman is allegedly seen killed,” the IDF said in a statement. “We are checking the information and at this stage we are unable to verify or refute it. ” Hamas claimed that communication with the woman’s captors had recently been restored after several weeks, leading to the discovery of her death. Abu Ubeida, spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said another female hostage who the woman was held with had been injured and that her life was endangered. Israeli authorities believe there are around 60 living hostages remaining in Gaza - and the bodies of dozens of others who are believed to be dead. Hamas is proscribed a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, and many other nations. The news came as Israel pressed ahead with its operations across Gaza on Saturday. According to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, about 120 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes across the territory in the past 48 hours. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Nearly 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Israel investigates as Hamas says female hostage killed,Israel investigates as Hamas says female hostage killed,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgzvqx252yo,articles/article_3066.txt,results/article_3066.txt.json

Lebanese civilians are being warned not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani river, located 20 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border, and residents in around 25 villages have been told to evacuate and head north. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the operation is aimed at the Iran-backed group's ""infrastructure"", which it says poses ""an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel"". An Israeli senior security official told the BBC earlier that ground forces had only ventured a ""very close walking distance"" into Lebanon, but Hezbollah deny claims that troops are in the country.

Hezbollah has also claimed to have fired at the headquarters of Mossad, the international arm of Israel's intelligence service, in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon are continuing. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant previously implied the army was ready for a ground operation, telling troops near the Lebanese border Israel was prepared to use forces ""from the air, sea and land"" to target Hezbollah. In a statement posted on X, external at 02:00 local time on Tuesday morning, the IDF confirmed troops had moved across the border following a build-up of tanks and other armour in northern Israel. The Lebanese army is pulling back troops stationed on its southern border to at least 5km (3 miles) north, according to Reuters news agency, which cited a Lebanese security source. Lebanon's prime minister, Najib Mikati, said on Tuesday that his country was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases"" in its history. Around one million people had been displaced across Lebanon since Israeli air strikes began last month, he added. Speaking during a meeting with United Nations organisations, Mikati issued an ""urgent call"" for more aid to help support them. The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee has also listed 25 villages in southern Lebanon, telling residents there to evacuate immediately. He added: ""Any home used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted. ""On Monday, Gallant told Israeli troops at the border that Israel's military would use all ""the means at our disposal"" to allow displaced people to return home in the north of the country. In a short video, he said the ""elimination"" of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on Friday ""is a very important step, but it is not everything"". He added that ""everything that needs to be done - will be done"" and that ""we will use all the forces from the air, sea and land"". The Israeli government has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of its citizens to return to their homes after nearly a year of cross-border fighting, which began with Hezbollah firing rockets at the start of the war in Gaza. The Lebanese armed group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and other countries - is known to have extensive tunnel networks as well as bunkers and other military infrastructure just over the border from Israel. Hezbollah's deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said the group - which is thought to have tens of thousands of well-trained fighters - was ready for an Israeli ground offensive. He described their attacks on Israel so far as the ""minimum"", adding that the battle could be long. Hezbollah - which is backed by Iran - has experienced mass casualties from exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, a wave of assassinations of its military commanders and devastating air strikes which have killed civilians, as well as the use of bunker-busting bombs in Beirut, which killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday. Explosions lit up the night sky on Monday as airstrikes hit Hezbollah’s stronghold of Dahieh, in Beirut's southern suburbs, near the airport. The attacks came shortly after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate buildings it said were linked to the group. In southern Lebanon, there were reports of heavy shelling in the border town of Aita al-Shaab. And near the city of Sidon, officials say a strike hit a building in a crowded Palestinian refugee camp, the first time it has been attacked in this conflict. Lebanese officials say more than 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks, while around a million may now be displaced. On Monday, US President Joe Biden said ""we should have a ceasefire now"". ""I'm more aware than you might know and I'm comfortable with them stopping,"" Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke to his US counterpart Antony Blinken on Monday, with the US State Department saying they discussed efforts to resolve the conflict. Both men stressed the need for a ceasefire and that the hostages taken by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas in the 7 October attack on Israel need to be returned home. The European Union's member states have called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ""any further military intervention would dramatically aggravate the situation and it has to be avoided"". Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas have both confirmed the killing of the head of Hamas in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin, in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. Israel's military said Sherif was ""responsible for co-ordinating Hamas's terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives"". Another Israeli strike in the central Beirut neighbourhood of Kola early on Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Palestinian armed group said in a statement. The statement named those killed as military security chief Mohammad Abdel-Aal, military commander Imad Odeh and fighter Abdel Rahman Abdel-Aal.

A year on from the attack - that saw some 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage - Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to stop such an assault happening again, saying Israel's armed forces were “changing the security reality” of the region. Since 7 October, nearly 42,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As the day of commemorations unfolded, Israel said it had intercepted more than 100 rockets fired by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as projectiles launched by Yemen's Houthis and from Hamas in Gaza. Overnight, rocket warning sirens continued to sound in northern Israel, and several more town were declared closed military zones, as Israel looks set to expand its ground offensive across the Lebanon border. On Tuesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Suhail Hussein Husseini, Hezbollah's logistics commander, was killed in a ""precise, intelligence-based strike in the area of Beirut"" on Monday. Hezbollah has not commented. Husseini was responsible for the budgeting and logistical management of Hezbollah's most sensitive projects, including its war plans and other special operations, the IDF said. The US has indicated that it supports targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon - but fears that what has been described as a limited operation by Israel could quickly turn into a larger-scale, prolonged conflict. And as American and Israeli officials discuss Israel’s response to last week’s unprecedented Iranian missile attack, CIA director William Burns has warned that there is a ""very real danger of a further regional escalation"".

On Monday, families of the hundreds killed and dozens of people taken hostage at the festival gathered at the site early for the first memorial event of the day. Holding pictures of loved ones they listened to the last track played at the festival before Israeli President Isaac Herzog led a minute's silence at 06:29, the moment that the attack began. In nearby communities also attacked by Hamas gunmen, smaller events were held. Elsewhere, Netanyahu visited the Iron Sword memorial in Jerusalem for victims of the Hamas attacks, lighting a candle to ""remember our fallen, our hostages"". In Tel Aviv's biggest park, Israeli families gathered for an event billed as the Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony, which served as an alternative to the official government memorial ceremony. Some of Israel's most popular singers gave emotional performances, while images of victims flashed on the screens. The stage was adorned with items symbolising the attacks including burnt and broken cars from the Nova music festival, and a child’s bicycle and swing set from the Be’eri kibbutz. Outside Israel, US President Joe Biden joined other world leaders in condemning what the ""unspeakable brutality"" of the Hamas attacks a year ago. He also expressed horror at the subsequent war, saying ""far too many civilians had suffered, far too much"". Mourners also gathered at vigils around the world including in Australia, South Africa, Germany and the US. In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer told the House of Commons he supported Israel's right to defend itself. But Britain's prime minister insisted there was no military solution to the current crisis and appealed for all sides to ""step back"". However as the memorial services took place, the wider conflict in the region raged. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired more than 130 rockets across the border from Lebanon. Most were shot down, but some hit the cities of Haifa and Tiberius. Earlier Hamas also launched rockets at Tel Aviv from Gaza. The army said ballistic missiles had been fired at Israel from Yemen but had been intercepted. Through the day, Israel carried out multiple air strikes and several ground incursions in Lebanon. The Israeli military said it was expanding operations against Hezbollah, warning residents in southern Lebanon to avoid using boats in the sea or rivers south of the Awali river. Three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 1,400 people, and displaced another 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident. . . in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel.",Israel marks year since Hamas attack as fighting rages on multiple fronts,Israel marks year since Hamas attack as fighting rages on multiple fronts,"israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g57q20l1vo,articles/article_3068.txt,results/article_3068.txt.json

The UN report gathered testimony from men, women and children who had been detained, who said ""they were held in cage-like facilities, stripped naked for prolonged periods, wearing only diapers"". UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said testimony received by his office suggested Israeli authorities may have inflicted ""appalling acts"" on detainees, including ""waterboarding and the release of dogs"". Many have been held without without charge, access to a lawyer, and in ""deplorable conditions,"" the report adds. The report also documents the suffering Israeli hostages say they endured while held by Hamas. Former hostages said they were deprived of adequate food and water in captivity, with some also saying they were beaten. Israeli forces have detained thousands of Palestinians over the course of the war in Gaza - mostly from Gaza but also from the occupied West Bank and Israel itself. Human rights defenders have raised concerns about the detention facilities some detainees are being held in, with both Israeli whistleblowers and released detainees alleging widespread mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says it has been refused permission to visit facilities where Palestinian prisoners are being held. In July Israeli authorities said they were investigating reports of abuse in detention centres, but gave no details. Responding to previous allegations, Israel said violence against detainees was “absolutely prohibited” and that it regularly briefed its forces on the conduct required of them. Earlier this week, Israeli military police detained reservists accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian prisoner in the Sde Teiman jail in southern Israel. The US state department has also previously expressed concern about allegations of ill-treatment. But today’s UN report contains the most extensive accounts, from former detainees and families of those detained, of alleged mistreatment. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year, when militants from the group killed around 1,200 Israelis and took 251 more hostage. Israel retaliated with a months-long military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The report suggests thousands of Palestinians have been arrested, some of them medical staff together with their patients, others children sheltering in schools. At least 53 people are believed to have died in detention. Those released told UN human rights investigators of being blindfolded, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burnt with cigarettes. Some women and men also spoke of sexual and gender-based violence. Mr Türk said the testimonies in the report indicated a ""flagrant violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. "" Detaining people indefinitely, denying them access to lawyers or any contact with their families or humanitarian organisations could, the UN says, amount to the international crime of enforced disappearance. The report is sure to anger Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which insists its troops are upholding international law in Gaza, and has long claimed the UN is biased against Israel.  The UN report calls on all parties to the conflict to ""immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention, including the holding of hostages, as well as torture or other ill-treatment, rape and other forms of gender-based violence, and ensure accountability for serious violations and abuses"".",Israel may have tortured Palestinian prisoners - UN,Israel may have tortured Palestinian prisoners - UN,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cglkvjr7lx0o,articles/article_3069.txt,results/article_3069.txt.json

Armed Israeli soldiers entered the building early on Sunday during a live broadcast. Israel's military said a legal opinion and intelligence assessment determined that the offices were being used ""to incite terror"" and ""support terrorist activities"", and that the channel's broadcasts endanger Israel's security. Al Jazeera ""vehemently"" condemned the closure and ""unfounded allegations presented by Israeli authorities to justify these illegal raids"", and called the move an ""affront"" to press freedom. The Foreign Press Association said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the development, which it also said threatened press freedom. ""Restricting foreign reporters and closing news channels signals a shift away from democratic values,"" the organisation said. Viewers watched as the troops handed the closure order to Al Jazeera’s West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari, who read it out live on air. “Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,” Mr al-Omari said in comments reported by his employer. The soldiers confiscated the last microphone and camera off the street outside and forced Mr al-Omari out of the office, Al Jazeera journalist Mohammad Alsaafin said. Posting about the raid on social media, Mr Alsaafin said the troops also pulled down a poster of Shireen Abu Aqla - an Al Jazeera reporter who was killed while covering a raid by Israeli forces in the West Bank. The network and witnesses at the time said the Palestinian-American reporter was shot by Israeli forces. Israel initially argued she had been shot by a Palestinian. However, months later it concluded there was a ""high probability"" that one of its soldiers killed her. About the closure of the offices, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it and Israel Border Police, alongside the civil administration, enforced an order signed by the Commander of the Central Command. The offices had been sealed and equipment confiscated, the IDF added. Al Jazeera decried the ""draconian actions"" and ""oppressive measures"", but said it would not deter the network from covering Gaza and the West Bank. The news outlet said it would pursue all available legal channels through international legal institutions to protect its rights and journalists, as well as the public's right to information. Relations between the Qatari-owned broadcaster and the Israeli government have long been tense, but have worsened following the outbreak of war in Gaza. With foreign journalists banned from entering the strip, Al Jazeera staff based in the area have been some of the only reporters able to cover the war on the ground. In April, the Israeli parliament passed a law giving the government power to temporarily close foreign broadcasters considered a threat to national security during the war. A ban would be in place for a period of 45 days at a time, as seen in Sunday's raid, and can be renewed.

3071,2024-11-07 17:35:26.325000+00:00,/news/articles/c1mlp9xdxl1o,"The Israeli parliament has passed a law allowing the government to deport the family members of people convicted of terrorism offences, including Israeli citizens. The controversial legislation, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, applies to first-degree relatives, meaning the parents, siblings or children of those found guilty of committing or supporting terrorism. Israeli human rights organisations say the law is unconstitutional. Some opposition members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, suggested it is targeted only at Palestinian citizens of Israel, sometimes called Israeli Arabs. The law allows for the deportation of the family members of those who had advance knowledge and either failed to report the matter to the police or “expressed support or identification with an act of terrorism”. Relatives of those who published “praise, sympathy or encouragement for an act of terrorism or a terrorist organisation” could also be deported. Relatives would be deported by order of the interior minister. Some members of the Knesset suggested during the debate on the bill that it would not be used against Jewish extremists, the Times of Israel website reported. “Yigal Amir’s family will not be deported anywhere,"" said opposition member of parliament Merav Michaeli, referring to former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassin, a Jewish extremist. Mickey Levy asked “whether you will deport Ben Gvir’s family,” a reference to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s conviction in his youth for incitement to violence and supporting a terror group. Dr Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst, told the BBC there was ""no question"" the law was intended to apply to Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. ""It is very unlikely that a Jewish citizen of Israel would ever be deported under this law,"" Dr Scheindlin said. ""This is clear from certain provisions in the law itself but also important elements which will determine how the law is applied, including that in normal Israeli parlance, the term 'terror' is almost never applied to Jewish acts of violence against Palestinian civilians. ""About 20% of the country's population are Palestinian citizens of Israel. A truck which hit a bus stop in central Israel last month, killing one and injuring dozens, was driven by a man identified by authorities as a Palestinian citizen of Israel. Many Israeli Arabs have also been convicted for posting support or sympathy for Hamas on social media since 7 October last year. Both the justice ministry and the attorney general’s office have raised concerns about how the legislation, which will likely be challenged in court, can be enforced. Eran Shamir-Borer, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute and a former international law expert for the Israeli military, said that if the legislation reached the Supreme Court, it would likely be struck down. “The bottom line is this is completely non-constitutional and a clear conflict to Israel’s core values,” Mr Shamir-Borer told the Associated Press news agency. Those deported will be sent to Gaza or to “another destination determined according to the circumstances"". Other than the military, ordinary Israeli citizens are not legally allowed to enter Gaza. About 100 Israelis are thought to be being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas, including around 60 who are thought to still be alive. Israeli citizens would retain their citizenship even after being expelled from the country. They would not be allowed to return for between seven and 15 years. Permanent residents could be deported for between 10 and 20 years. The majority of the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem hold permanent Israeli residency. In addition, a five-year temporary order was approved allowing for prison sentences for children under the age of 14 convicted of murder as part of an act of terrorism or as part of the activities of a terrorist organisation.","Israel passes law to deport relatives of attackers, including citizens","Israel passes law to deport relatives of attackers, including citizens","israel,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1mlp9xdxl1o,articles/article_3071.txt,results/article_3071.txt.json

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies were located on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The IDF named the hostages as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. Spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said an initial assessment was they were ""brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them"". A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, insisted Israel was responsible for their deaths, as it has refused to sign a ceasefire deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not rest until those responsible for their killing are brought to justice. In a statement, he also said his government was committed to achieving a deal to release those remaining in captivity and protects the country's security. ""Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal,"" he added. Hamas hostages: Stories of the people taken from IsraelA group representing the families of those held hostage in Gaza has demanded that  Mr Netanyahu ""address the nation and take responsibility for abandoning the hostages"". The Hostages Families Forum said that all six held captive were ""murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity"". ""The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,"" they added in a statement. The group has also announced plans to ""bring the nation to a halt"" on Sunday, asking the Israeli public to join protests in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel to call for a hostage exchange deal. One of Israel's most prominent opposition politicians, Yair Lapid, joined the calls for a general strike to put renewed pressure on the government to agree a deal. He accused Mr Netanyahu's ""cabinet of death"" of deciding against saving the hostages to avoid conflict with his far-right allies in government. ""He prefers saving the coalition with [Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich] and [National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir], rather than saving our children's lives. This blood is on their heads"", Mr Lapid added. A Bedouin Arab man rescued in Gaza last week by Israeli troops urged Israel to reach a deal with Hamas to free all the remaining hostages. After returning to his village in southern Israel on Wednesday, Kaid Farhan Elkadi said his ""happiness is not complete so long as there are detainees here and there”. “Every one of them, whether Arab or Jewish, has a family waiting for them and everyone wants to be happy,” he added. In its statement on Sunday morning announcing the deaths of the hostages, the IDF said the bodies had been ""returned to Israeli territory"". ""They were all taken hostage on 7 October [2023] and were murdered by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip. ""The statement added that their families had already been notified. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the ""heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces with the news"" of their killing. ""On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,"" he added. Sharone Lifschitz, whose father Oded is being held in Gaza, said the hostages were killed because of delays in getting a deal She also accused the Israeli government and Hamas of placing ""more and more obstacles"" in the way of reaching an agreement. Ms Lifschitz's mother Yocheved was released in the November 2023 hostage exchange, in which more than 100 people were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Meanwhile, after the death of Mr Goldberg-Polin - an American citizen - was confirmed, US President Joe Biden said he was ""devastated and outraged"" by the news.

Kaid Farhan Elkadi, 52, was rescued in a ""complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip"" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet domestic security service, according to a statement. No further details could be published ""due to considerations of the safety of our hostages, the security of our forces, and national security"", it said. Mr Elkadi - the eighth hostage rescued by Israeli forces since the start of the war in Gaza - is in a stable condition in hospital, where he is undergoing examinations. Photographs released by the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba showed him speaking to members of his family while sitting in a hospital armchair. Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that he managed to escape his captors before being rescued, and that the soldiers attempted to understand whether he had been held with other hostages. Mr Elkadi's brother, Hatam, told Haaretz, external that he was ""a little thin"". ""We told him that everything is fine and that everyone is waiting for him outside,"" he said. ""We've been waiting for this moment for a long time. We hope that all hostages will get this moment, that they will all experience the same excitement and joy,"" he added. ""May all the hostages return, and may all the families feel this feeling. ""Mr Elkadi, a father of 11 and grandfather of one, is from a Bedouin village in the Rahat area of the Negev desert. He worked for many years as a security guard at Kibbutz Magen, close to the Israel-Gaza border, where he was abducted 10 months ago. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video announcement that he could not go into many details about the operation in which he was freed. But he added that he could ""share that Israeli commandos rescued [him] from an underground tunnel, following accurate intelligence"". Footage released by the IDF showed Mr Elkadi sitting down, smiling and speaking to soldiers, external, including the commander of the 162nd Division, moments after his rescue. A senior Israeli military official confirmed that troops were operating in ""a complex underground system where hostages were suspected to be held"". Mr Elkadi was alone in the tunnel when he was found by Israeli troops when he was rescued, the official added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had congratulated Mr Elkadi in a telephone call and told him that all Israelis were moved by the news. ""We are working relentlessly to return all of our hostages,"" the statement quoted Mr Netanyahu as saying. ""We are doing this in two main ways: negotiations and rescue operations. The two of these together require our military presence on the ground, and constant military pressure. ""The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described the rescue as ""miraculous"". But it stressed that ""military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror"", and that ""a negotiated deal is the only way forward"".

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, had been at a demonstration against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita last Friday when she was shot by Israeli forces. The US secretary of state called Eygi's killing ""unprovoked and unjustified"", but President Joe Biden later said: ""Apparently it was an accident. It [the bullet] ricocheted off the ground. ""Eygi's family, along with the UN human rights office, have called for a full and independent investigation into her killing. In a brief statement summarising their investigation findings, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said the gunfire had not been ""aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot. ""They added: ""The IDF expresses its deepest regret over the death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi. ""However, the US - Israel's key ally - reacted angrily. Its Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said Israeli forces needed to ""make some fundamental changes in the way that they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement. ""He said the IDF’s investigation appeared to support eyewitnesses' testimony that Ms Eygi had been protesting peacefully and thus her killing was “unprovoked and unjustified”. “No-one should be shot and killed for attending a protest, no-one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views,” Blinken told reporters shortly after Israel's release of the findings. Ms Eygi had arrived as a volunteer in the West Bank just a few days before she was killed. Her family has said her life ""was taken needlessly, unlawfully and violently by the Israeli military"". “A US citizen, Aysenur was peacefully standing for justice when she was killed by a bullet that video shows came from an Israeli military shooter,"" her family said in statement released after her death. Prior to the release of the Israeli report, the US and Turkish governments had condemned Ms Eygi's killing. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded it as ""barbaric"". In its statement, the IDF said the ""incident"" had taken place during ""a violent riot in which dozens of Palestinian suspects burned tires and hurled rocks toward security forces at the Beita Junction. ""But the protest group which Eygi had been with at the time dismissed claims it threw rocks at Israeli soldiers, saying such assertions were “false”. They said their protest had been peaceful. Witnesses and other protesters at the demonstration have also said while there were some clashes with Israeli soldiers, Eygi had not been near that area when she was hit. Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli activist who was at the same protest as Eygi, said he heard two gun shots. He told the BBC's Newshour programme  there had been ""no stone throwing"" at Ms Eygi's location. It had been her first time attending a protest in the West Bank, he said. She had been with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a pro-Palestinian organisation which takes part in weekly demonstrations at Beita against Israeli settlements. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war.

3075,2024-09-20 03:13:53.112000+00:00,/news/articles/cwyl8v1z1zeo,"Israel has carried out extensive air strikes on southern Lebanon, saying its warplanes have hit more than 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and other ""terrorist sites"" including a weapons storage facility. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the launchers were ready to be fired against Israel. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israel carried out at least 52 strikes in the south of the country on Thursday evening. Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it had also launched strikes on military sites in northern Israel. The Israeli air strikes, which lasted more than two hours, were some of the most intense of the recent conflict. On Friday morning, Israel lifted orders restricting movement that it had issued on Thursday for communities in the Golan Heights and parts of northern Israel, its military confirmed. The IDF added it would be carrying out ""activities in the training areas"" of northern Israel over the weekend and that ""gunshots and explosions"" might be heard in nearby settlements. Earlier, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said deadly explosions earlier in the week ""crossed all red lines"", accusing Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war. Israel has not said it was behind the attacks - which saw pagers and walkie-talkies explode simultaneously across the country - on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said Israel is embarking on a ""new phase of the war"", concentrating more of its efforts on the north. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Chief nursing officer Hisham Bawadi told the BBC that the medical centre where he works in Beirut received a ""tsunami of patients"" after the explosions. ""Most of the injuries were facial with mainly the eyes, the face affected, the upper extremities, and some injuries on the abdomen,"" he said. A number of planned surgeries will be taking place over the weekend to ""be able to cater for the high number of casualties"" caused by the exploding pagers, he added. Two firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility, with the Taiwanese government saying the different parts of the pagers were not from Taiwan. ""The components are low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,"" Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said. Bulgaria's state security agency DANS  also said none of the pagers that exploded during Tuesday's bomb attacks in Lebanon were imported to, exported from, or made in Bulgaria, after local media reports said a company there had facilitated the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. In a statement late on Thursday, the IDF said its warplanes ""struck approximately 100 launchers and additional terrorist infrastructure sites, consisting of approximately 1,000 barrels that were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory"". ""The IDF will continue to operate to degrade the Hezbollah terrorist organisation’s infrastructure and capabilities in order to defend the state of Israel. ""Lebanese security sources cited by Reuters news agency and the New York Times said the Israeli strikes were among the most intense since the war in Gaza began in October last year. The IDF also urged residents in northern Israel close to the Lebanese border to avoid large gatherings, guard their neighbourhoods and stay close to bomb shelters. On Thursday morning, Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon fired two anti-tank missiles across the border, followed by drones. The IDF said two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third seriously wounded. In his televised address on Thursday, Hassan Nasrallah said of Tuesday and Wednesday's attacks: “The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally. ""He added: “This is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security. It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description. This was the enemy's intention. ”As Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already exhausted population, while others struck targets in southern Lebanon. The Hezbollah leader acknowledged that this was a massive and unprecedented blow for his group, but he insisted that its ability to command and communicate remained intact. Nasrallah’s tone was defiant and he vowed a harsh punishment. But again, he indicated that Hezbollah was not interested in an escalation of its current conflict with Israel. The group’s cross-border attacks, he said, were going to continue unless there was a ceasefire in Gaza, and no killings or assassinations would return residents to northern Israel. The IDF said on Thursday that its chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, had “recently completed approval of plans for the northern arena”. Gallant later said that ""in the new phase of the war, there are significant opportunities but also significant risks”. “Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” he added. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price. ”It is not clear how Israel intends to achieve this goal. But reports earlier this week suggested that the general in charge of the IDF’s Northern Command favoured the creation of an Israeli-controlled buffer zone inside southern Lebanon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for restraint on all sides. ""We don't want to see any escalatory actions by any party"" that would make the goal of achieving a ceasefire in Gaza more difficult, he said as he joined European foreign ministers in Paris to discuss the widening crisis. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who was also at the talks in Paris, called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. ""We are all very, very clear that we want to see a negotiated political settlement so that Israelis can return to their homes in northern Israel and indeed Lebanese to return to their homes,"" he said.",Israel says 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers hit in Lebanon,Israel says 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers hit in Lebanon,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyl8v1z1zeo,articles/article_3075.txt,results/article_3075.txt.json

Israeli security forces shot dead Wissam Khazem and then carried out air strikes on the other two as they attempted to flee, a statement said. The Palestinian health ministry said the three men were killed overnight near the town of Zababdeh, south-east of Jenin. Hamas also confirmed their deaths. The ministry said an elderly man was later killed by Israeli gunfire in Jenin itself, while Israeli forces pulled out of Tulkarm and its refugee camps. At least 20 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Israeli operation, which is one of the biggest in the West Bank in two decades, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Armed groups have identified most of them as fighters. The Israeli military has said 20 ""terrorists"" have been killed in exchanges of fire and air strikes and 17 suspects detained during what it has described as ""a precise, targeted regional operation across three terror hubs"". There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. On Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Shin Bet domestic security agency and Israel Border Police put out a joint statement announcing that Wissam Khazem had been killed during an operation in the Jenin area. It said Border Police forces had “encountered and eliminated” Khazem in a car, and accused him of carrying out and directing shooting and bombing attacks. Shortly afterwards, it added, an IDF aircraft had “eliminated two additional terrorists while they attempted to flee from the vehicle”. It named them as Maysara Masharqa and Arafat Amer, and alleged that they had taken part in shooting attacks. The Palestinian health ministry said the three men had been killed in Zababdeh and that their bodies had been taken away by Israeli forces. Residents of the town found the burned-out wreck of a car riddled with bullet holes and reported that there had been two drone strikes. Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed that Khazem was a leader in Jenin camp and that Masharqa and Amer were members. Israeli forces also continued their operation in Jenin itself for a third consecutive day. Palestinian news agency Wafa cited the Palestinian Red Crescent as saying that a man from an eastern neighbourhood of the city had been shot and killed by Israeli forces on Friday night, and that the ambulance transporting his body to a local hospital had later came under fire. Wafa identified the dead man as Tawfiq Qandil, 82. Meanwhile, residents of Tulkarm and its refugee camps inspected the damage to homes and infrastructure following the withdrawal of Israeli forces. A woman in Nur Shams camp, Umm Yazan, told the BBC that soldiers had laid wires from her home to blow up two of the houses opposite. ""I have 10-year-old triplets, and they trapped us in a room,” she said. ""Then they started the explosions - five explosions in total. Imagine the walls shaking and your young children clinging to you. It feels like we’re in Gaza. ""The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had killed “five terrorists who were hiding in a mosque”, including Mohammed Jaber, the leader of the local Tulkarm Brigade, which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Wafa said four Palestinians had been killed during the 48-hour operation. Jaber was buried in Nur Shams on Friday along with 69-year-old Ayed Abu Hajja, a disabled man who neighbours said was shot by a sniper when he opened a window of his house in the camp. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military announced that forces had pulled out of the al-Faraa refugee camp near Tubas after completing what it called “the objective of foiling terror, exposing terrorist infrastructure and eliminating armed terrorists”. The head of the Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, said tens of thousands of people in four refugee camps had been affected by the raids, and that the agency had been forced to suspend services in several camps. With the war in Gaza still raging, the Israeli operation is causing international alarm. The UK said on Friday that while it recognised Israel’s need to defend itself against security threats, it was “deeply worried by the methods Israel has employed and by reports of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure"". ""The risk of instability is serious and the need for de-escalation urgent,"" a Foreign Office spokesperson said.

An official said special forces had apprehended the individual and taken them back to Israeli territory, in what was described as a “special operation”. Lebanon’s state news agency said an “unidentified military force” arrived on the beach at dawn, raided a nearby building, and captured one person before leaving by speedboat. The raid has prompted anger from Lebanese authorities, with the office for Prime Minister Najib Mikati saying he had instructed the foreign ministry to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council. It added the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping force Unifil were both investigating the raid - and that Mikati had called for ""expedited"" results. Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamieh suggested the raid may have violated UN Security Council resolution 1701, which is intended to end hostilities following on from the Israel-Hezbollah conflict of 2006. ""If it is proven that the kidnapping took place via a naval landing, where is the implementation of Resolution 1701?"" he was quoted as saying by local media. Hezbollah did not comment on Israel’s allegation that the person captured was a member of the group, while Hamieh told local media the man was a captain of civilian ships. CCTV footage that emerged online - which the BBC located to Batroun - appeared to show a group of soldiers leading a captive between some buildings. The Israeli military gave limited details on the operation but said the unit involved was Shayetet 13, a marine commando unit specialising in sea-to-land incursions. Batroun, a Christian town to the north of Beirut, has been relatively sheltered from Israeli military operations in Lebanon to date, which have focused on the country's south, the Bekaa valley in its east, and the southern suburbs of Beirut.

A statement said Itay Svirsky, 38, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, was “murdered in captivity by his captors”. Hamas said in January that Svirsky and another hostage, Yossi Sharabi, 53, had been killed by Israeli air strikes. Earlier, the military said an investigation had concluded that the most plausible explanation for the deaths of six other hostages found dead in a tunnel in Gaza in August was that they were shot by Hamas ""close"" to the time of an Israeli air strike. Troops recovered the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, 35, Alexander Dancyg, 76, Avraham Munder, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, Chaim Peri, 79, and Nadav Popplewell, a 51-year-old British-Israeli dual national, along with those of six Hamas fighters, in the southern Khan Younis area. The military said it was “highly probable"" the hostages' deaths were related to a February strike on a nearby underground site that targeted Hamas commanders. Pathologists found indications of gunshots on the hostages’ bodies, while no gunshot wounds were found on the fighters' bodies, it added. Due to the extended time that had passed ""it was not possible to determine with complete certainty the precise cause of death of the hostages or the exact timing of the gunfire”, according to the military. “According to the most plausible scenario, the terrorists shot the hostages close to the time of the strike,” it said. “However, it is also possible that the hostages were shot by other terrorists post-mortem; it is even possible that the hostages were killed prior to the strike in the area. ”An Israeli military official told reporters that the military believed the six Hamas fighters “were killed from secondary effects of our strike"", like lack of oxygen. The military also stressed that it had ""no information”, at the time of the strike that the hostages were in the underground site that was targeted or its vicinity. “Had such information been available, the strike would not have been carried out,” it said, noting that it was preceded by the required planning and approval process. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Buchshtab, Dancyg, Munder, Metzger, Peri and Popplewell were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Kibbutz Nirim on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent months working on a deal to secure the release of the 96 remaining hostages, 34 of whom are presumed dead, in return for a ceasefire in Gaza. But the negotiations have stalled, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for the impasse. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the military investigation’s findings ""serve as yet another proof that the lives of hostages face constant, daily danger”. “Time is of the essence - many of the hostages are still alive and enduring impossible conditions of abuse, starvation and isolation,” it warned. The forum called on US and the other mediators to “do everything necessary to achieve a deal for the hostages' return”. It separately welcomed the return of Itay Svirsky's body for burial in Israel, saying it ""provides crucial closure for his family"". Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Wednesday that ""pressure on the monstrous organisation known as Hamas is growing"". “There is a chance that this time we will truly be able to advance a hostage deal. ” More than 44,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday evening, at least 20 people were killed by an air strike in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis, according to medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said a tented camp for displaced families was bombed and that the dead included five children. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted ""senior Hamas terrorists"" in the area. Another 10 people were killed when Israeli strikes hit three houses in Gaza City, in northern Gaza, according to Mr Bassal. Earlier, five people were killed in an Israeli strike on the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, medics said. Local media said four of the dead were children and that the strike had targeted a queue outside a bakery.

Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to enter the buffer zone and ""commanding positions nearby"" from the Israeli-occupied part of the Golan. ""We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border,"" he said. A UK-based war monitor said Syrian troops had left their positions in Quneitra province, part of which lies inside the buffer zone, on Saturday. On Sunday, the IDF told residents of five Syrian villages inside the zone to stay in their homes until further notice. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau about 60km (40 miles) south-west of Damascus. Israel seized the Golan from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War and unilaterally annexed it in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so unilaterally in 2019. The Israeli move in the buffer zone came after Syrian rebel fighters captured the capital, Damascus, and toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime. He and his father had been in power in the country since 1971. Forces led by the Islamist opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered Damascus in the early hours of Sunday morning, before appearing on state television to declare Syria to now be ""free"". Netanyahu said the collapse of the Assad regime was a ""historic day in the Middle East"". ""The collapse of the Assad regime, the tyranny in Damascus, offers great opportunity but also is fraught with significant dangers,"" he said. He said events in Syria had been the result of Israeli strikes against Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, Assad's allies, and insisted Israel would ""send a hand of peace"" to Syrians who wanted to live in peace with Israel. The IDF seizure of Syrian positions in the buffer zone was a ""temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found"", he said. ""If we can establish neighbourly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire. But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel,"" he said.

In normal times, its warning to residents in several villages to stay in their homes because Israel would not hesitate to act if it felt it needed to would be seen as hugely provocative and enough to start a war. Israel is especially concerned about who might get their hands on Bashar al-Assad's alleged arsenal of chemical weapons. The leader of the Syrian rebellion is Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. His family roots are in the occupied Golan Heights, where thousands of Israeli settlers now live alongside about 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, who stayed on after it was captured. Israel will have no intention of giving that land up and is determined to protect its citizens.

Cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - a day after the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. ""The Security Cabinet has updated the objectives of the war to include the following: Returning the residents of the north securely to their homes,"" a statement from the prime minister's office said. ""Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,"" it added. Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the only way to return Israel's northern residents to their homes was through ""military action"", during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein. “The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said. ""Therefore, the only way left to ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes, will be via military action. ”Gallant's comments came as speculation grew that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to replace him amid differences between the two men over the war in Gaza. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned of the devastating consequences of further escalation. In a statement from the US defence department, his office said he ""reaffirmed the necessity of a ceasefire and hostage deal, and that Israel should give diplomatic negotiations time to succeed, noting the devastating consequences that escalation would have on the people of Israel, Lebanon, and the broader region. ""Israel has repeatedly warned it could launch a military operation to drive Hezbollah away from the border. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organisation which is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. The group has so far made no public comments on the issue. The latest Israeli move marks an expansion of the country's previously stated war goals: The elimination of Hamas and its military capabilitiesThe return of all the hostages taken during the 7 October attackEnsuring that the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to IsraelIsraeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.

He also said Unrwa’s remaining shelters were so overcrowded that displaced people were “forced to live in the toilets”, and cited reports that people trying to flee were being killed. The Israeli military has been intensifying a weeks-long offensive in parts of northern Gaza against what it said were Hamas fighters who had regrouped there. On Monday residents and medics said Israeli forces were besieging hospitals and shelters for displaced people. The Israeli military said it was facilitating evacuations of civilians and ensuring hospitals remained operational while it continued “operating against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure”. Medics at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza told Reuters that Israeli troops stormed a school and detained the men before setting the building ablaze. Palestinian media also reported on Monday that at least 10 people had been killed by Israeli artillery fire that hit a camp for displaced people at a school in Jabalia refugee camp, a densely-populated urban area to the north of Gaza City. Israel does not allow the BBC and other international media into Gaza to report independently, making it difficult to verify facts on the ground, so we rely on information from video footage and testimonies. Graphic videos of the aftermath of the Israeli strike posted online by Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency and local journalists appeared to show at least four bodies, including a child and a woman, lying on the ground inside a tented camp. One of the videos was filmed by a paramedic called Nabila as she ran between the dead and wounded. “Calm down,” she is heard screaming at a badly hurt woman sitting in a pool of blood, “I swear I don’t have anything to stop the bleeding”. In a passage pockmarked by shrapnel, she comes across a woman sitting with a baby, who says: “My children are gone, look at them. ”The Israeli military said it was checking the reports. The Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, also announced that 41 aid lorries and six fuel tankers had been transferred to the north over the past day, external, and that a Unicef mission had been able to deliver polio vaccines to the north. Cogat said there were also 600 lorry loads of aid waiting to be picked up and distributed at various crossings, most of it by UN agencies. The UN said no aid was allowed into northern Gaza during the first two weeks of October, when the Israeli military began its offensive in and around Jabalia. The UN’s acting humanitarian chief said a “trickle” of aid was allowed through last week, after the US warned Israel in a letter to urgently boost access within 30 days or risk having some military assistance cut off. On Monday, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it had been asking Israeli authorities for four days to access to the Falouja area of Jabalia but had been denied. The OCHA also shared a video showing an appeal for help from a Jabalia resident who said he was one of 32 people buried underneath a building, external destroyed in an air strike on Friday. “Eighteen of us got out. Fourteen people remain under rubble, including little kids. They are two, three and four-year-olds, as well as women. They’re under rubble. Alive. They begged for me to rescue them but I couldn’t,” Shamekh al-Dibes said. Meanwhile, a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who recently visited Gaza City said the suffering for the estimated 400,000 people in the north was “unimaginable”. “Heavy fighting and evacuation orders are tearing communities apart. While some are desperate to leave, many, especially the elderly, sick, and people with disabilities, are unable to leave. Other stay, believing nowhere is safe,” Stephanie Eller said in a video, external. “Hospitals are overwhelmed, struggling with too many patients and lack of fuel, electricity, and water supplies,” she added. “People need food, water, medical care and, above all, a respite from the ongoing hostilities. ”Hadeel Obeid, the chief nurse at the Indonesian hospital, also near Jabalia, said its water supply had been cut off and that was no food for the fourth consecutive day. She also said that the hospital needed permission from the Israeli military to operate its generator. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Israel still preventing humanitarian missions to north Gaza, Unrwa says","Israel still preventing humanitarian missions to north Gaza, Unrwa says","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvglg9293ddo,articles/article_3082.txt,results/article_3082.txt.json

The school, closed during the war, was housing displaced people, the health ministry said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted a Hamas command centre which Israel said the militant group was using to ""plan and carry out terrorist attacks”. Hamas has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsettingThe Hamas-run government media office said the people killed in Saturday's strike in the al-Zaytoun area included several children and six women. Gaza's civil defence agency reported the same death toll and added that one of the women was pregnant. Several graphic videos of the aftermath of the strike examined by BBC Verify appear to corroborate this. Other footage shows children among the victims. Some are seen with severe injuries, including parts of their legs missing. Others are seen lying motionless while adults try to deliver CPR. BBC Verify confirmed the location by comparing details seen in the background to satellite and ground-level images of the targeted school. The IDF said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, and accused Hamas of exploiting civilian infrastructure. Hamas ""systematically violates international law by operating from inside civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and exploiting the Gazan civilian population for its terrorist activities"", the IDF said. Also on Saturday, the health ministry said that four of its workers were killed and six injured in an Israeli ""targeting"" of a health ministry warehouse in the Musabah area of southern Gaza. The ministry did not specify whether the incident was an air strike. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment on the report of health workers killed. Other schools have been hit, some several times, by Israeli air strikes since the latest conflict with Hamas began on 7 October. Earlier this month, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said six of its employees were killed in an Israeli air strike on al-Jaouni school in Nuseirat refugee camp, which is being used as a shelter by thousands of displaced Palestinians. Unrwa said it was the fifth time the school had been hit since 7 October. Israel's military said it carried out a “precise strike on terrorists” planning attacks from the school. The military alleged that nine of those killed were members of Hamas’s armed wing and that three of them were Unrwa staff. Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,000 people, according to the health ministry.","Israel strike kills 22 in Gaza school, says Hamas-run health ministry","Israel strike kills 22 in Gaza school, says Hamas-run health ministry","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4x6dwqlxgo,articles/article_3083.txt,results/article_3083.txt.json

Al-Awda hospital told AFP and Reuters that the strike on Thursday hit the Al-Shuhada school in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The Hamas-run government media office reported the same death toll and said the school was being used as a shelter for displaced people. Videos from the scene, verified by the BBC, show wounded children being carried out in the arms of men. Israel said it had targeted a Hamas command centre at the site ""used by the terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks"" against Israel and its troops. The government media office said ""thousands of displaced people” were using the school as a shelter when the strike hit, “most of them children and women"". Nine children were among the 17 killed, with more than 52 injured, the media office added. Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency, also told AFP that 17 people were killed and dozens wounded. In recent weeks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has hit several buildings being used as shelters across Gaza, saying it was targeting Hamas personnel and infrastructure. Israel does not allow international media organisations - including the BBC - independent access to Gaza, making it difficult to verify facts on the ground, so we rely on information from video footage and testimonies, as well as Israeli and Hamas official statements. In northern Gaza, the IDF has been intensifying a weeks-long offensive against what it said were Hamas fighters who had regrouped there. At least 650 people have been killed since the new offensive in the north began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military said it was facilitating evacuations of civilians while it continued “operating against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure”. But residents unwilling or unable to comply with Israeli evacuation orders are said to be living in increasingly desperate conditions, with food and other essential supplies running out. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that , externalduring the first three weeks of October, Israeli authorities permitted only four out of 70 coordinated aid missions to north Gaza. The US warned Israel last week to urgently boost aid or risk having some military assistance cut off. Cogat, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said that, external trucks carrying food, water and medical supplies had been transferred to the north over the past week. OCHA said earlier this week that humanitarian access remains restricted. The final stage of an emergency polio vaccination campaign in the area has been postponed by UN agencies because of intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access. The last phase of the two-stage rollout - prompted by Gaza’s first case of polio in 25 years, which left a baby boy paralyzed - was due to begin on Wednesday. Almost 120,000 children in northern Gaza had been expected to receive a second dose of the oral polio vaccine.","Israel strike on Gaza school-turned-shelter kills 17, hospital says","Israel strike on Gaza school-turned-shelter kills 17, hospital says","israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3y1r24992o,articles/article_3084.txt,results/article_3084.txt.json
3085,2024-11-26 03:12:31.924000+00:00,/news/articles/c93qe2v1n3eo,"Israel carried out waves of air strikes on Lebanon's capital, Beirut, just hours before the Israeli security cabinet was expected to approve a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah on Tuesday evening. Seven people were killed when a building in the city was hit, and two dozen strikes in southern suburbs and central areas targeted what the Israeli military said were Hezbollah infrastructure sites and financial facilities. Hezbollah also continued to fire rockets into Israel as hopes rose for an announcement of a deal to end over a year of conflict. The proposal includes a 60-day ceasefire that will see Israeli troops withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah fighters removed from south of the Litani river.  Thousands of troops from the Lebanese Army are expected to be deployed, and an international committee will monitor the implementation of the ceasefire. On Tuesday afternoon, just before the Israeli security cabinet began discussing the ceasefire proposal, Israeli warplanes carried out what appeared to be the largest wave of air strikes yet in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Multiple plumes of smoke were seen rising from Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based, after the Israeli military had issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings. The military said in a statement that it had struck 13 Hezbollah targets in Dahieh, including an aerial defence unit centre, intelligence and command centres, weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure. Another seven strikes targeted what the military called “components of Hezbollah’s financial system”, including facilities of the Al-Qard Al-Hassan financial institution. Less than two hours later, the military issued evacuation orders for four areas in the city itself for the first time, telling people to leave buildings in Ras Beirut, Mazraa, Msaytbeh and Zuqaq al-Blat. Earlier on Tuesday, an air strike hit the Nuweiri area in central Beirut without warning, which indicated a possible assassination attempt. At least one building collapsed and images showed crowds searching the rubble. The Lebanese health ministry said seven people were killed and 37 others injured. There was no comment from the Israeli military. The strikes happened amid an expectation that a ceasefire deal would be imminent, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly agreeing to the deal in principle. The details of the proposed agreement are unclear,  but it is understood to be based on the terms of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The resolution requires, among other things, Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the area between the Blue Line – the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel – and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Israel says that was never implemented, while Lebanon says Israel’s violations included military flights over its territory. During the current US-led talks, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, it has been made clear to the Lebanese authorities that the post-2006 situation, in which Hezbollah was allowed to build extensive infrastructure along the border, will not be repeated. So one of the key points seems to be the implementation of the deal. The US will lead a five-country monitoring committee, while the UN peacekeeping force in the south of Lebanon (Unifil) will be reinforced. During the 60-day ceasefire, the Lebanese Army is expected to deploy 5,000 troops to the south, although questions remained about their role in enforcing any agreement, and whether they would confront Hezbollah if needed, which has the potential to exacerbate tensions in a country where sectarian divisions run deep. The army has also said it does not have the resources - money, manpower and equipment - to fulfil its obligations under the deal, which will probably be alleviated by contributions from some of Lebanon’s international allies. But there had been an acceptance by Lebanese authorities that things had to change, the diplomat added, and there was the political will to do so. Media reports suggest the US will issue a letter supporting Israel’s right to act in Lebanon if Hezbollah is perceived as being in violation of the deal. This Israeli demand has been rejected by Lebanon, where it is seen as a violation of the country’s sovereignty. It has not been included in the proposal deal, and will probably be made public later. In the past few days, Israeli authorities have repeatedly said that, with or without this guarantee, they reserved the right to attack Lebanon if there was any threat coming from Hezbollah, as they already do in Syria. ""We believe we've reached this point where we're close,"" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday. But he added: ""We're not there yet. ""The French presidency also said that negotiations had ""significantly advanced"" and urged Israel and Hezbollah to ""quickly seize this opportunity"". The Lebanese deputy speaker of parliament, Elias Bou Saab, said there were ""no serious obstacles"" to a ceasefire ""unless Netanyahu changes his mind"". A Lebanese source told the BBC that Hezbollah and Iran, the group’s main supporter, had said in private that they were interested in ceasefire deal. In a televised speech last week, Hezbollah’s new leader Naim Qassem appeared to give his green light to the US-drafted proposal. Meanwhile, there is not full support for the plan in Israel. Many of the tens of thousands of citizens displaced by over a year of fighting with Hezbollah, say it won’t make them feel safe enough to return home, and Israel’s far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said the war should continue until there is “absolute victory. ” Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It says it wants to ensure the safe return of about 60,000 residents of northern Israeli areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The war has been devastating for Lebanon, where more than 3,700 people have been killed since the start of the hostilities and one million residents have been displaced in areas where Hezbollah holds sway. The World Bank’s estimate is of $8.5bn (£6.8bn) in economic losses and damage. Recovery will take time, and no-one seems to know who will pay for it. Hezbollah, too, has been devastated. Many of its leaders have been killed, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, while its infrastructure has been heavily damaged. How it will look like after the war remains unclear. The group has been severely weakened, some would say humiliated, but it has not been destroyed. In Lebanon, it is more than a militia: it is a political party with representation in parliament, and a social organisation, with significant support among Shia Muslims. Hezbollah’s opponents will probably see it as an opportunity to limit its influence - it was often described as “a state within a state” in Lebanon before the conflict - and many fear this could lead to internal violence.

Videos showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from a seafront area that is only a few hundred metres from Unesco World Heritage-listed Roman ruins. Lebanon’s state news agency said the strikes caused “massive destruction” to homes and infrastructure, but there were no reports of any casualties. The Israeli military said it targeted command-and-control centres of Hezbollah, including its Southern Front headquarters. The military’s Arabic spokesman had earlier issued a map of the neighbourhoods where he said it was going to act “forcefully” against the Iran-backed armed group. Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the city in recent weeks in response to Israel’s intense air campaign and ground invasion. But before the strikes began, a spokesman for a disaster management unit said about 14,000 people were still living in the city, including those displaced from elsewhere in the south. “You could say that the entire city of Tyre is being evacuated,"" Bilal Kashmar told AFP news agency, adding that many people were heading towards the suburbs. Wael Farraj said he and his family had fled in response to the evacuation order and that they were sitting by the sea when they heard that their home had been destroyed. “We took the children, grabbed what we could,” he told Reuters news agency as he inspected the damage. “We came back and looked, and our house had collapsed. ”""We are staying here and we are steadfast. We will remain here. . . among the rubble. ""Another man, Issam Awad, said: “Just like everyone else, we were sitting, and suddenly, without warning, the bombing started. ”“Thank God, we’re all fine, and no-one got hurt by the explosions. ”The Israeli military said the strikes were part of its efforts to target Hezbollah’s activities, external and obstruct its attempts to rebuild its military capabilities. It also accused the group of systematically taking over civilian and religious areas to carry out attacks in a way that endangered the Lebanese population. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli aircraft carried out multiple air strikes elsewhere in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley on Wednesday. The regions were also targeted overnight along with the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The Israeli military said the strikes in Beirut targeted weapons storage and manufacturing facilities, as well as command centres belonging to Hezbollah. On Wednesday evening the pro-Hezbollah TV channel al-Mayadeen said its bureau in the city had been hit by an Israeli strike. The military also said it had killed the Hezbollah sector commanders for the southern areas of Jibchit, Jouaiya and Qana in air strikes over the past several days, and that its troops had killed about 70 Hezbollah fighters during operations inside southern Lebanon to dismantle the group’s infrastructure and weapons caches. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. However, the group did say its fighters had launched barrages of rockets into Israel on Wednesday, including one in the morning that targeted the Gilot intelligence base, which is north of the central city of Tel Aviv. Rocket alert sirens sounded in Tel Aviv, prompting senior US officials travelling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to be ushered to a safe room in their hotel. It is not known whether or not Blinken himself was also forced to shelter. Another rocket barrage hit two factory buildings in the northern Israeli towns of Acre and Kiryat Bialik, causing damage but no injuries. Later, Hezbollah confirmed that Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to become the group's next leader, was killed in an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut on 4 October. Safieddine was the cousin of Hezbollah’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in another strike in the capital the previous week. Israel’s launched its full-scale military campaign against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,900 in the past five weeks, according to the country’s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.","Israel strikes Lebanon's Tyre, close to site of ancient Roman ruins","Israel strikes Lebanon's Tyre, close to site of ancient Roman ruins",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y387ne93po,articles/article_3086.txt,results/article_3086.txt.json
3087,2024-10-30 19:13:34.184000+00:00,/news/articles/crez85y20zvo,"Israeli strikes have killed 19 people, including eight women, around Lebanon's eastern city of Baalbek, the country's health ministry has said. It came hours after tens of thousands of residents fled in response to evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military that covered the entire city and two neighbouring towns. Mayor Mustafa al-Shell told the BBC more than 20 strikes were reported on Wednesday afternoon in the Baalbek area, with five inside the city itself, where there is a Unesco-listed ancient Roman temple complex. The Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah command-and-control centres and infrastructure in Baalbek and Nabatiyeh, in southern Lebanon. The military also said it had targeted Hezbollah fuel depots in the Bekaa Valley, where Baalbek is located. It gave no details, but Lebanon's state news agency said diesel tanks were hit in the town of Douris, where Mr Shell said pictures showed a huge column of black smoke rising into the air. The attacks came as Hezbollah’s new secretary-general said the group would continue its war plan against Israel under his leadership and that it would not “cry out” for a ceasefire. Speaking a day after his appointment was announced, Naim Qassem said he would follow the agenda of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last month. Qassem made the speech from an undisclosed location amid reports suggesting he had fled to Iran, which is Hezbollah’s main supporter. After weeks of an air offensive that has brought devastation to large parts of southern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Israeli military appears to be expanding its campaign against Hezbollah in the east of the country - another area where the group has a strong presence and support. Baalbek is a key population centre in the Bekaa Valley, near the border with Syria. It is a largely rural area and one of Lebanon’s poorest regions. Hezbollah has established part of its infrastructure and recruited fighters from there. The area is also strategically important for Hezbollah, as it is part of a route linking the group to its allies in Syria and Iraq and, ultimately, to Iran. On Wednesday morning, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for the whole of Baalbek and the neighbouring towns of Ain Bourday and Douris, external, warning that it would “act forcefully against Hezbollah interests”. Roula Zeaiter, programme manager for the Lebanese Women Democratic Gathering (RDFL), said the orders sparked panic among residents, including displaced families from other parts of the country. ""Minutes after the order to leave came, the streets were filled with people grabbing their things, locking their homes and closing their shops,” she told the charity ActionAid. “We’re scrambling like scared mice, moving from place to place. Lebanon is becoming like Gaza, with Israeli forces using the same tactics. ”Videos posted online showed huge traffic jams on the main roads out of the city. Mustafa al-Shell estimated that about 50,000 people fled within two hours, but he added that many others decided to stay behind “for various reasons”. He said the initial wave of Israeli strikes on Wednesday afternoon hit villas and other residential buildings in Baalbek’s city centre and its outskirts. “It’s not clear what the Israelis have targeted,” he added. “But I can tell you that there are no ammunition dumps or weapons caches in Baalbek. ”The state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that the Ras al-Ain Hills, Amshki, al-Asira, al-Kayyal Road areas were hit, and the northern and southern entrances to Baalbek. The strikes also targeted Ain Bourday and Douris, including diesel tanks in its vicinity, it said. Later, the Lebanese health ministry said 11 people, including three women, were killed in a strike on Salibi Farm in the Baalbek area. Eight others, including five women, were killed in another strike in Bednayel, it added. The ministry separately said another 11 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the town of Sohmor, in the southern Bekaa Valley. Following the strikes on Baalbek, the Israeli military said it had conducted ""intelligence-based strikes on fuel depots located inside military compounds belonging to Hezbollah's Logistical Reinforcement Unit 4400 in the Bekaa Valley"". The unit was responsible for transferring weapons from Iran, it added. A second statement said aircraft had ""struck command-and-control centres and terrorist infrastructure"" in the Baalbek area. It also accused Hezbollah of systematically using civilian infrastructure and areas for military activities, which the group has previously denied. Mr Shell said none of the strikes hit Baalbek’s Unesco World Heritage site, external, which comprises the ruins of Roman temples which date back to the 1st Century AD and are among the largest and best-preserved in the world. However, he warned of what he called “Israeli treachery” and said Lebanese authorities were “pleading. . . for international bodies to stand fast in defence of Baalbek's Roman ruins”. Unesco warned in a post on X on Wednesday, external that featured a photo of the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek, that World Heritage sites across the Middle East, particularly those in Lebanon, were under threat. “Unesco recalls to all parties their obligation to respect and protect the integrity of these sites. They are the heritage of all humanity and should never be targeted,” it said. On Monday night, several buildings were levelled around the Gouraud Barracks area of Baalbek, near the Roman ruins, during Israeli strikes that killed more than 60 people across the Bekaa Valley. When asked by reporters in Washington about the Baalbek strikes, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller called on Israel not to threaten the lives of civilians or damage critical civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage. He also confirmed that US Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk were “traveling to Israel to engage on issues including a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon, as well as how we get to an end to the conflict in Gaza”. Lebanon’s Prime Minister, Najob Mikati, expressed optimism that a ceasefire might be possible in ""the coming hours or days"". Two sources told Reuters news agency that US mediators were working on a proposal for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah which would be used to finalise the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701. The resolution ended the last war they fought in 2006 and included a call for southern Lebanon to be free of any armed personnel or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state and a UN peacekeeping force. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The Israeli military said about 60 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday. No injuries were reported. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 2,100 in the past five weeks, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities.

Lebanon's health ministry said at least 92 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, with hundreds more killed since the strikes escalated on Monday. Hezbollah has confirmed that an air strike on an apartment building in the south of Beirut killed the head of its drone unit, Mohammad Surur. Fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, after a dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since Monday. The increase in hostilities prompted a 12-strong bloc - including the US, UK and EU - to propose a three week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah on Wednesday. The proposal was initially met with hope after Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said his country was “open to ideas”. But by Thursday it had been roundly rejected by Israeli politicians. Landing in New York for the UN General Assembly, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would “not stop” in Lebanon until it reached all of its goals, “chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes. ”The White House later said the ceasefire proposal had been “coordinated” with Israel, despite Mr Netanyahu's assertion, just hours later, that his country would continue fighting. Early on Friday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement seeking to ""clarify a few points"" due to ""a lot of misreporting around the US-led ceasefire initiative"". ""Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,"" the statement said. ""Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,"" it said, adding it ""appreciates the US efforts in this regard"". Discussions will continue in the days ahead, the statement finished. Speaking in New York, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called for an ""immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement"" to resolve the conflict in Lebanon. He said the conflict could spill over into a war ""no one can control"". Around 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza, began nearly a year ago. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Through Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s south and in the Bekaa Valley in the country’s east. It also struck infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border, which it said was to cut weapons supplies to the group. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the city of Kiryat Ata, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel. The Israeli army said it intercepted a missile that was fired from Yemen after sirens and explosions were heard. Israel’s military chief Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday Israeli air strikes on Lebanon could pave the way for the IDF to “enter enemy territory”. Israeli Air Force (IAF) Commander Maj Gen Tomer Bar told troops on Thursday they should be “prepared” to support a “ground manoeuvre” into Lebanon. Meanwhile, Qatar joined calls for a de-escalation with government spokesman Majed al-Ansari saying the country had received ""horrific reports from Lebanon about targeting whole families, in a way that is similar to the atrocities in Gaza"". After meeting with British and Australian counterparts in London, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Israel and Hezbollah face the risk of ""an all-out war"" but that ""a diplomatic solution is still viable"". ""Israel has stated that its goal is to return its citizens to their home in the north. I believe the quickest way to do that is through diplomacy,"" Austin said. On Thursday evening, Israel's defense ministry (IMoD) said it had secured an $8.7bn (£6.5bn) US aid package to support its current military campaigns. In a statement, IMoD said the package includes $3.5bn for ""essential wartime procurement"", which has already been transferred, and $5.2bn for air defense systems such as the Iron Dome, David's Sling and an advanced laser system.",Israel striking Hezbollah with ‘full force’ despite ceasefire calls,Israel striking Hezbollah with ‘full force’ despite ceasefire calls,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20jx85vxwdo,articles/article_3088.txt,results/article_3088.txt.json
3089,2024-11-27 19:55:43.318000+00:00,/news/articles/cm273g1jm51o,"Israel will appeal against the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant. Judges last week issued warrants for the two men along with Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe the three men bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel's government, along with Netanyahu and Gallant, strongly rejected the accusations. On Wednesday, the prime minister's office said it had informed the ICC of its ""intention to appeal to the court along with a demand to delay implementation of the arrest warrants"". It reiterated that Israel both denied the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant. Netanyahu's office also said US Senator Lindsey Graham had updated Netanyahu ""on the efforts that he is advancing in the US Congress against the ICC and countries that have co-operated with it"". US President Joe Biden called the warrants ""outrageous"" last week. ""Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security,"" he said. ICC member states - which do not include Israel or the US - are obliged to take action in detaining a wanted defendant if they are found to be in their jurisdiction. Some European Union countries have indicated that they will respect the ICC's decision, while others have declined to say what they would do if Netanyahu entered their territory. The British government has indicated that Netanyahu would face arrest if he travelled to the UK. France's prime minister said last week that it would ""rigorously"" comply with its obligations under international law. But on Wednesday the French foreign ministry said that the Israeli leader may have immunity from arrest under the ICC warrant because Israel is not an ICC member state. ""Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other ministers concerned and will have to be taken into account should the ICC request of us their arrest and surrender,"" a statement said. It expressed this view the day after a ceasefire deal was announced to end the war between Israel and Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon. France and the US had been instrumental in negotiating the agreement. Rights groups criticised France's statement as a response to political pressure to maintain good relations with Israel. ""No-one gets immunity from an ICC arrest warrant because they're in office - not Netanyahu, not Putin, no-one,"" said Andrew Stroehlein from Human Rights Watch. The ICC ruled in 2021 that it had jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza because the UN’s secretary general had accepted the Palestinians were a member. The ICC prosecutor's case against Netanyahu, Gallant and Deif stems from 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign to eliminate Hamas, during which at least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ICC judges said they found reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility for:The war crime of starvation as a method of warfareThe crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane actsNetanyahu said the ICC's decision was a ""dark day in the history of humanity"" and ""an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us"". Gallant said the warrants placed “the State of Israel and the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimises the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds”. The ICC judges said they found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was responsible for:The crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violenceThe war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violenceIsrael believes it killed Deif in an air strike in Gaza in July, but the ICC prosecution said it was not in a position to confirm that. Hamas made no mention of the warrant for Deif but welcomed the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying the ICC's decision “constitutes an important historical precedent. The ICC - established in 2002 - investigates, arrests and tries individuals charged with the gravest international crimes: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. The court has more than 120 members. However, key powers including the US, China, Russia and India are not members, having never signed or ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute.

The Israeli military said the missile landed in an uninhabited area early on Sunday, but that shrapnel indicated air defence systems had failed to destroy it before it entered Israeli airspace. It added that it was investigating how the missile was able to reach so far into Israeli territory. The strike marks the first time a missile fired by the group has reached central Israel, which is around 2,000km (1,240 miles) from Yemen.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been repeated attempts to shoot the missile down on Sunday but that it most likely fragmented in mid-air. The Houthis claimed the operation used a new type of hypersonic missile, which may help explain the failure of efforts to intercept it. They are an armed group that seized much of Yemen in the country’s ongoing civil war and have declared themselves part of the Iran-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US, and the wider West. The Houthis said in a statement that Sunday's attack was carried out in solidarity with the Palestinians and that Israel should expect more ahead of the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks. Missile fragments landed at a railway station in the city of Modiin, causing some damage, and in open ground near Israel's main international airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The damage is believed to have been caused by Israel's own interceptor missiles.  Netanyahu said the strike showed that Israel was in a ""multi-front battle against Iran's axis of evil that strives to destroy us"". ""[The Houthis] should have known by now that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us,"" he said. ""Anyone who attacks us will not escape from our arms. ""Hamas is already learning this in our determined action that will lead to its destruction and the release of all of our hostages. ""Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas following the 7 October attacks, which saw around 1,200 people killed and another 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,206 people have been killed in Gaza since the campaign began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. This is not the first time the Houthis have attacked Israel. In July, one man was killed and eight people were injured after a Houthi drone landed in Tel Aviv. Previously, almost all Houthi missiles and drones fired towards Israel had been intercepted and none were known to have reached Tel Aviv. In response, Israeli jets attacked the city of Hodeidah in Yemen, causing a huge fire which engulfed one of the country’s most important oil storage facilities.",Israel vows 'heavy price' for Houthi missile strike,Israel vows 'heavy price' for Houthi missile strike,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgll5268e2o,articles/article_3090.txt,results/article_3090.txt.json

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published a map, external showing a swathe of territory several miles deep, which it said residents must not return to. Anyone who did, it said, would be putting themselves in danger. More than a million Lebanese have been displaced by the fighting, mostly from the south. Tens of thousands of Israelis have also been displaced. The truce came into effect on Wednesday morning, though officials in Israel and Lebanon have accused each other of already breaching it. On Thursday, the IDF said its forces fired artillery and carried out air strikes against targets in southern Lebanon. It added that it had fired at suspects after spotting activity at a Hezbollah weapons facility, and vehicles arriving in several areas, which it said breached the ceasefire. Lebanon accused Israel of violating the agreement “multiple times” and said it was monitoring the situation. A multinational monitoring group which includes representatives from the US, France, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) was set up as part of the ceasefire to oversee compliance with its terms. In his first interview since the ceasefire was declared, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had instructed the IDF to wage ""an intensive war"" should Hezbollah commit a ""massive violation"" of the ceasefire. The ceasefire ""can be short"", he said in the interview with Israel's Channel 14. Under the terms of the agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, Israeli forces will withdraw from south Lebanon as the Lebanese army deploys there simultaneously with no other armed groups allowed to operate in the area. This is meant to happen within 60 days from the start of the ceasefire. The zone which the IDF said residents should not yet return to stretches from Mansouri on the coast to Shebaa in the east. On Wednesday, the Lebanese army warned residents not to return to areas where Israeli forces were before they had withdrawn. Israel invaded southern Lebanon at the start of last month after the IDF intensified military action against Hezbollah. Hezbollah began the current conflict with Israel by firing rockets in and around northern Israel on 8 October 2023, a day after Hamas' unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza which killed about 1,200 people. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians after Israel responded to the Hamas attack with a massive military campaign in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 44,330 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive. Since 8 October, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire with increasing intensity. The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli strikes had killed at least 3,961 people and injured 16,520 others in that period. The figures do not  differentiate between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah’s attacks have killed 31 soldiers and 45 civilians inside Israel, Israeli authorities say. Another 45 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting in southern Lebanon. In his first reaction since the agreement, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the group would co-ordinate with the Lebanese army to implement the ceasefire. Hezbollah, he said, had achieved a great victory - preventing Israel from destroying it. It is a narrative which may be embraced by its supporters, but not by others given the scale of loss of human life and the widespread destruction of land and property in Lebanon.",Israel warns against returning to 60 Lebanon villages,Israel warns against returning to 60 Lebanon villages,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxv1727g5lo,articles/article_3091.txt,results/article_3091.txt.json

The brief overnight statement was issued in response to a Washington Post story, external which said Benjamin Netanyahu had told the US he was willing to target military sites in Iran – rather than nuclear or oil facilities. Citing two officials, the Post said Netanyahu made the comments during a phone call with US President Joe Biden last Wednesday, when they discussed Israel's intended retaliation. Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on 1 October. Most of the projectiles were intercepted, Israel's military said. US deploys Thaad anti-missile system to IsraelBiden and Netanyahu speak as Israel mulls Iran responseBiden opposes any Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites At the time, Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake"" and would ""pay for it"". The overnight Israeli statement, sent alongside a link to the Washington Post article, said: ""We listen to the American government’s thoughts, but will make our final decisions based on Israel’s national security needs. "" According to an anonymous official quoted in the Post, Israel's retaliatory strike would be designed to avoid the appearance of ""political interference"" in the upcoming US presidential election, which is less than a month away. Analysts have said a hit on Iranian oil facilities could push up oil prices, and therefore affect the polls, which currently suggest a close race between Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The price of crude oil shot up 5% at the beginning of the month, immediately after President Biden spoke about the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran's oil infrastructure. The US has appeared to be trying to limit Israel's response to Iran. Biden has said the US does not support any potential strike on Iranian nuclear sites - a course of action touted by some in Israel, including former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett. And on 4 October, Biden went further, signalling the US would also oppose an Israeli strike on Iran's oil facilities. ""If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields,"" he said during a news conference. Israel has not officially said how it intends to respond to Iran's October missile attack - the second in six months - but Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said last week its reaction would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"". ""They will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,"" Gallant said. Iran has, in turn, said it will not let any attack by Israel go unanswered. Meanwhile, the US has said it will help bolster Israel's air defences, by deploying a high-altitude anti-missile system. The Pentagon said that the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) deployment underscored the US's ""ironclad"" commitment ""to the defence of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran"". Iran said its October missile barrage was a response to Israel's assassinations of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) officer in Beirut, and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah in recent weeks, carrying out deadly air strikes predominantly in southern and eastern Lebanon, and also in the capital, Beirut. Before that, Israel and Hezbollah had been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis since last October, when Hezbollah began firing into Israel which it said was a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza. It had said it would stop firing if there was a ceasefire in Gaza.",Israel will respond to Iran based on national interest - PM,Israel will respond to Iran based on national interest - PM,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrjvxxp0m8o,articles/article_3092.txt,results/article_3092.txt.json
3093,2024-11-06 12:48:23.568000+00:00,/news/articles/clyvl72zdzqo,"We’ve known for months that there is no love lost between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his now former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant. But this year, there have been reports of stand-up rows and shouting matches between the two men over Israel’s war strategy. Gallant has vastly more military experience than Netanyahu. He began his career as a navy commando in 1977 and rose to be a major general in Israel’s Southern Command, overseeing two wars in Gaza between 2005 and 2010. The suspicion is that Gallant’s military superiority and respect from within the armed forces grated with his boss. In Israel’s hard-line government, the most right-wing in the country’s history, Gallant was less hawkish than some of his fellow ministers. But he was no dove. After Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the country’s biggest ever military humiliation, Gallant was initially fully behind the war in Gaza. Along with Netanyahu, he faces possible war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court. Both men rejected the allegations made by the ICC's prosecutor when he sought warrants for them in May. But in recent months as defence minister, Gallant argued that Israel's government should prioritise a hostage release deal with Hamas and end the war in Gaza. Netanyahu hasn’t listened, insisting that continued military pressure on Hamas was the best way to free the remaining Israelis being held. Since the beginning of the year, Gallant had raised concerns about the lack of a post-war strategy. Again, it fell on deaf ears. He has pushed for a comprehensive investigation into the military, political, and intelligence failings that led to the 7 October attack. The prime minister has been resistant, arguing now is not the time. Gallant was also unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students to be exempt from serving in the military. At a time of multiple wars, he said, the country couldn’t afford such luxuries. Netanyahu, wary of the collapse of his coalition government which has been dependent on support from the ultra-Orthodox parties, paid no heed. The new Defence Minister, Israel Katz, who up until yesterday was the foreign minister, is more hawkish and much more in step with his boss’s thinking. Following his appointment, he vowed to “achieve the goals of the war”, including “the return of all hostages as the most important moral mission, the destruction of Hamas in Gaza, [and] the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon”. But compared to Gallant, Katz has virtually no military experience. That will raise concerns here and abroad at a time when Israel is fighting two wars, in Gaza and in Lebanon, which risk further engulfing the wider Middle East. The cabinet has now lost the last remaining minister who was willing and able to confront Netanyahu, another likely reason Gallant was shown the door. There have been rumours for months that he was on the verge of being sacked. The timing of his dismissal on the day of the United States election cannot be ignored. The former defence minister has a much better relationship with President Joe Biden’s White House than Netanyahu, whose rapport is frosty at best. His sacking can be seen as one more jab in the eye to the now outgoing US administration. It will come as no surprise if the Israeli prime minister is much more willing to listen to advice on war strategy handed out by Donald Trump’s team. Of course, in the merry-go-round world of Israeli politics, no-one will be shocked if this is not the last we hear from Gallant. He has been sacked as defence minister once before, back in March 2023. On that occasion, along with many high-ranking military and former military officials, he was unhappy with Netanyahu’s controversial plans to overhaul the judicial system. His dismissal led to tens of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets calling for him to be reinstated. After just a few days, Netanyahu was forced to back down and return Gallant to his position. On Tuesday night, as news broke that he had been sacked again, there were again protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but not on the same scale. Gallant belongs to the same political party as Netanyahu, Likud, and could one day challenge his leadership in any future elections. But the fact he has been given his marching orders now suggests the prime minister is feeling strong. As has been the case for the past year, it is Israel’s longest-serving leader, its most Machiavellian and successful political operator, who is calling the shots.",Israel's Netanyahu shows who calls the shots with Gallant sacking,Israel's Netanyahu shows who calls the shots with Gallant sacking,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvl72zdzqo,articles/article_3093.txt,results/article_3093.txt.json
3094,2024-10-15 16:38:39.380000+00:00,/news/articles/ce9j74z7xvmo,"Tensions between Israel and the UN over its peacekeeping operations in southern Lebanon have escalated in recent days – although the confrontations have their roots in years of mistrust and recriminations. In the latest standoff, the head of UN peacekeeping operations rejected a call on Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the forces known as Unifil to pull out of “combat areas”. The UN force was established in 1978 after the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, and had its role bolstered in 2006 to monitor and keep the peace there after  that year’s war between Israel and Hezbollah. I’ve filmed with UN peacekeepers patrolling the 120 km (75-mile) “Blue Line” – the UN-recognised boundary that separates Israel and Lebanon - and have seen the dangerous work of demining 5 million square metres of land in southern Lebanon, where Unifil has destroyed more than 51,000 mines and unexploded bombs left over after previous wars. But Israel accuses Unifil of falling woefully short in one of its other key responsibilities. Under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, the UN was meant to create an area in southern Lebanon free of armed forces other than those of the Lebanese army. “The UN is a failed organization and Unifil is a useless force that failed to enforce Resolution 1701, failed to prevent Hezbollah from establishing itself in southern Lebanon,"" said Israeli cabinet minister Eli Cohen in a recent social media post. Israel accuses Unifil of having turned a blind eye to Hezbollah’s extensive regrouping and rearming, as the Iranian-backed Shia organisation grew into a formidable fighting force – even bigger than the official Lebanese army. Hezbollah is now proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. According to the pro-Israel pressure group, UN Watch, Unifil “did nothing” as “Hezbollah was digging tunnels to invade Israel, kidnap & attack Israeli civilians… and embedding missiles in civilian homes. ”UN Watch and the Israeli Government’s Media office have published several posts in recent days alleging that Hezbollah had been able to operate freely and within clear sight of UN bases and posts along or near the Blue Line. Tunnels, heavy weaponry and equipment in preparation for attack on Israel have all been discovered after Israeli troops crossed the border into Lebanon. That, said a belligerent Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message addressed directly to the UN secretary general this week is why Israel is demanding that Unifil forces withdraw from conflict areas in southern Lebanon. The Israeli prime minister urged Antonio Guterres not to allow Hezbollah to use UN peacekeepers as “human shields” and said the secretary general’s refusal to evacuate the Unifil soldiers makes them ""hostages of Hezbollah. . . endangering them and the lives of our [Israeli] soldiers"". Israel was widely criticised after five Unifil peacekeepers were injured following the ground invasion on 1 October. In several incidents Israeli fire has hit clearly marked and unmistakable Unifil bases, and in one case Israeli tanks forced their way into a Unifil compound where they initially refused demands to leave. Israel has offered explanations for those incidents but, again, says the way to avoid a repetition is for Unifil troops to withdraw from the area. That has been met with a firm “No”. A Unifil spokesperson accused the Israeli military of “deliberately” firing on its positions and 40 of the nations that contribute troops to Unifil said last week that they “strongly condemn recent attacks” on the peacekeepers. The UN Security Council, meeting in New York, also “urged all parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and UN premises,” said Switzerland’s UN Ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl. She added: “They reiterated their support to Unifil, underscoring its role in supporting regional stability. ” There are UN bodies also trying to hold Israel to account in Gaza, where for the last week Israeli troops have been involved in an enhanced offensive to drive remaining Hamas fighters from northern areas, including the Jabalia refugee camp. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that they have issued clear orders for thousands of civilians to leave the conflict zone for so-called “safe areas”. But with as many as 400,000 people trapped in the north, few areas in Gaza can be considered “safe” and, according to many reports, more than 300 people have been killed in Israel’s latest offensive. That led the UN Human Rights Office to issue a strongly worded statement saying that the IDF was “trapping tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians, in their homes and shelters with no access to food or other life-sustaining necessities”. The statement also accused Israel of cutting off the area completely from the rest of Gaza and said that Israeli troops have fired on civilians trying to flee the area which could amount to a “war crime”. Israel says it is sending more food and medical supplies into northern Gaza and that Hamas is actively encouraging, even preventing, civilians from leaving Jabalia. For many in the current Israeli administration, the bottom line is that – for many years – the UN and its organisations have been inherently and structurally anti-Israel. Israel has long-accused Unrwa – the UN body established more than 70 years ago to support Palestine refugees across the Middle East, including Gaza and the West Bank - of actively acting against its interests. Israel has long-accused Unrwa – the UN body established more than 70 years ago to support Palestine refugees across the Middle East, including Gaza and the West Bank – of actively acting against its interests. It says Unrwa personnel were directly involved in Hamas’s 7 October attacks, when thousands of gunmen broke through the border fence from Gaza and killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took another 251 back to Gaza as hostages. The number of Unrwa personnel accused of participating in the attacks was 12, out of a 13,000-strong workforce. Israel’s Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told the  Security Council that Unrwa had allowed Hamas to infiltrate its ranks and that “this infiltration is so ingrained, so institutional, that the organization is simply beyond repair”. To that end, a committee in Israel’s parliament has now approved legislation that would ban Unrwa from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the Israeli government and the agency. Unrwa's head responded, saying that if the legislation is adopted, the body’s humanitarian operations in Gaza and the West Bank may “disintegrate”. Philippe Lazzarini said that senior Israeli officials were “bent on destroying Unrwa” which is the main provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza. It runs schools, primary healthcare centres and social services for the vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million people. But criticisms from the UN and its member nations will not deter Israel from achieving its military objectives in Gaza and Lebanon, nor in the occupied West Bank as long, crucially, as it enjoys the backing of the United States. Remarkably, Israel has gone as far as barring the UN secretary general from entering the country. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Antonio Guterres was now persona non-grata after not ""unequivocally"" condemning Iran's missile attack on Israel. The move prompted Mr Guterres to insist that he “strongly condemn[ed]” the attack, although the ""ban"" has not been lifted. While Israel might owe its very existence to the UN – the body that voted it into being in 1947 – its relationship with the organisation has never been so bad.",Israel's row with UN over Lebanon peacekeepers driven by long distrust,Israel's row with UN over Lebanon peacekeepers driven by long distrust,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9j74z7xvmo,articles/article_3094.txt,results/article_3094.txt.json
3095,2024-08-24 03:07:41.071000+00:00,/news/articles/c7854g3gz0eo,"Earlier this week, on live television, the mother of one of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza made an offer to the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar: Release all 109 hostages – dead and alive - in exchange for the children of Israel’s security chiefs. But Ditza Or, whose son Avinatan was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during the 7 October attacks, wasn’t pushing for Israel’s leaders to sign a ceasefire deal - she was pushing them to fight Hamas harder. Ms Or, and a handful of other pro-war hostage families, are unlikely allies of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now under immense pressure from his US ally, his security chiefs and even his own defence minister to be more flexible and reach a deal. Leaked reports of a recent phone call with his most important ally suggested that US President Joe Biden told the Israeli leader at one point to “stop bullshitting” him. The implication: that Mr Netanyahu didn’t want a deal at all. As negotiations limped on in Cairo this week, aimed at bridging the gaps between Israel and Hamas, leaks to Israeli media suggest that the gaps between Mr Netanyahu and his own negotiators and defence chiefs are getting wider. According to Dana Weiss, chief political analyst for Israel’s TV Channel 12, the prime minister privately accused key negotiators and security chiefs of “weakness”, presenting himself as standing alone in defence of Israel’s security interests. They have different approaches to the urgency of a deal, she says, and one reason for that is the differing level of responsibility each feels. “The military establishment feel guilty about 7 October, and feel a moral duty to bring back the hostages,” she explained.  “Our government, our ministers and especially Prime Minister Netanyahu don’t feel personally responsible for 7 October, they put the blame totally on the military establishment, and therefore do not feel that same sense of urgency to go ahead with a deal. ”Mr Netanyahu has said that getting the hostages home is his second priority in the war - behind victory over Hamas, and has emphasised his commitment to preserve Israel’s security “in the face of major domestic and foreign pressure”. The man who once cherished his image as Israel’s ‘Mr Security’ appears to be playing to it again, 10 months after that image was shattered by the 7 October attacks. A key sticking point in negotiations is whether Israeli forces withdraw from a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Mr Netanyahu appears to be sticking hard to a ""red line"" of keeping an Israeli military presence there, citing Israel’s security needs, despite leaks suggesting that his negotiators believe it is a “deal-breaker”. Senior Hamas figure Hussam Badran told the BBC on Friday that the group would accept nothing less than the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and that Mr Netanyahu’s position showed that he did not want an agreement, but was “manipulat[ing] through empty rounds of negotiations to gain time”. Hamas is widely seen as facing tough questions over what Gaza or the Palestinians have gained from the October attacks, after more than 10 months of bombing and displacement. Compromises on prisoner exchanges are seen as easier for the group to swallow than accepting the continued presence of Israel’s army in Gaza, and checkpoints for residents moving north. Egypt is also understood to be refusing any deal that does not have Palestinians in charge on the other side of their shared border. Hamas has not formally joined the current round of talks, and many believe Mr Sinwar’s own priority is keeping the Gaza War going in order to spark a regional conflict, which would put enormous pressure on Israel, and - the reasoning goes -force its prime minister into greater concessions to end it. The risks of a wider escalation – amid threats from Iran and Hezbollah – are one reason Washington is pressing hard for a deal. The US is three months away from a presidential election, and President Biden’s administration believes a ceasefire in Gaza would help calm the region. The political analyst, Dana Weiss, says that Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant  agrees that if Israel does not take the path of a ceasefire deal - even temporarily - then it will be on a sure path to escalation. “For the prime minister, it’s totally the opposite,” she says. “He answers: No, if we go ahead and cave to Sinwar now, Hezbollah and Iran see that we’re weak. We have to finish the task with Hamas, to prevent the war. ”But, she says, Mr Netanyahu also has domestic political incentives to stall the negotiations.  Among those incentives is the fact that, after months of abysmal approval ratings, he is now rising again in opinion polls. Several surveys have recently placed him at the top of respondents’ voting intentions, both in terms of his right-wing party, Likud, and his own personal profile as leader - results that were unthinkable a few months ago. All eyes are now on the next scheduled talks, due to take place on Sunday. In the meantime, Egypt has reportedly agreed to share Israel’s latest proposal for the border area with Hamas. Mediators insist a deal is still possible, but hopes on all sides appear to be shrinking. After meeting the Israeli prime minister today, Ella Ben Ami, the daughter of another Israeli hostage, said she looked Benjamin Netanyahu in the eye and asked him to promise to do everything and not give up until they return. She was left, she said, with “a heavy and difficult feeling that this isn’t going to happen soon”. The clock is ticking on these negotiations: for Gaza’s people, for the Israeli hostages still held there in tunnels, for the region as a whole.  But for Mr Sinwar and Mr Netanyahu, perhaps the most powerful weapon they have in this war is time.",Israel-Gaza ceasefire: Is a deal still possible?,Israel-Gaza ceasefire: Is a deal still possible?,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7854g3gz0eo,articles/article_3095.txt,results/article_3095.txt.json

It began at 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, putting an at-least temporary end to nearly 14 months of conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group. The deal was announced on Tuesday evening by Israel, France and the US, with President Joe Biden saying it aimed to be a ""permanent cessation of hostilities"". Attacks by both sides were recorded until shortly before the ceasefire started. Follow live updates on this storyWhat we know about the ceasefire dealQuestions over Hezbollah's future after ceasefireIsraeli anger at 'irresponsible and hasty' ceasefireWatch: People in Israel and Lebanon react to ceasefire deal Israel issued evacuation orders for parts of Beirut four hours before the ceasefire deadline, striking around an hour before. Hezbollah also fired drones into Israel in the hours before fighting stopped. Within minutes of the ceasefire starting, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned residents of southern Lebanon against ""heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area"". The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said on X the IDF would ""inform you when it is safe to return home"". Still, dozens of vehicles were seen heading south shortly after the ceasefire began by reporters for the Reuters news agency, some packed with personal belongings. Fighting had been ongoing for nearly a year when, in late September, Israel intensified bombardments and launched a ground invasion against Hezbollah. The war has been Lebanon's deadliest in decades, killing more than 3,823 people, according to local officials. Under the deal announced on Tuesday and brokered by the US, Israel will gradually withdraw its troops from Lebanon's south over a 60-day period. Over the same timeframe, Hezbollah fighters and weapons will be removed from the area south of the Litani River, a boundary established at the end of the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. They will be replaced by Lebanese government forces. ""This announcement will create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes,"" said a joint statement from the US and France, both of which will join an existing mechanism tasked with enforcing the UN resolution previously set at the end of the 2006 war. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire deal, calling it a ""fundamental step towards restoring calm and stability"" in the country and allowing citizens to return home. But he also demanded Israel ""fully comply"" with the deal, leave sites it currently occupies and to respect the UN resolution. Lebanese environment minister Nasser Yassin, meanwhile, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that given Hezbollah remains an ""active party"" the Lebanese parliament, his country now needed to focus on restoring the political process and facilitate ""dialogue"" between ""different communities"". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not hesitate to strike if Hezbollah breaks any part of the agreed deal. ""If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack,"" he said. Biden said Israel ""retains the right to self defence consistent with international law"". A snap poll for Israeli TV showed 37% of Israelis in favour of the ceasefire, 32% against and 31% saying they didn't know. Netanyahu also said ending the fighting in Lebanon, Israel's northern neighbour, would allow the IDF to focus on ""the Iranian threat"". Hezbollah had long been seen as Iran's first line of defence. But with much of the group's missile arsenal now destroyed, the military balance between Iran and Israel appears to have tilted in Israel's favour. Hezbollah's ""weakness"" following the conflict concerns Iran, which wants to ""preserve"" the force's domestic standing in Lebanon, according to former US envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross. Having lost its entire leadership, the group ""will take a long time to recover"", Mr Ross told the BBC on Wednesday. He said he anticipated the ceasefire will last beyond 60 days because both sides have an interest in extending it: Hezbollah because it needs time to recover, and Israel, which Mr Ross said ""does not want to get stuck"" fighting in Lebanon. The past 13 months of violence began when Hezbollah started firing rockets into Israel a day after its ally Hamas carried out a brutal attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Netanyahu said ending the fighting in Lebanon would also increase pressure on Hamas. ""From day two of the war, Hamas was counting on Hezbollah to fight by its side. With Hezbollah out of the picture, Hamas is left on its own,"" Netanyahu said. He said ending fighting in Lebanon would also give the IDF space to resupply weapons, munitions and troops, and thus could free up more Israeli forces to serve in Gaza. Parallel negotiations to end that conflict have been deadlocked for months. US officials have expressed some hope the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire will provide momentum for a breakthrough in the Gaza talks. On Tuesday, Biden said his administration was working with Turkey, Egypt and Qatar to ""make another push"" on a deal. No US troops will be deployed to enforce the current ceasefire, US officials clarified. The war has been devastating for Lebanon, where, in addition to the 3,823 people killed and 15,859 injured, one million residents have been displaced in areas where Hezbollah holds sway. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It has said it wants to ensure the safe return of about 60,000 residents of northern Israeli areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians. Hezbollah attacks on Israel and the occupied Golan Heights have killed at least 75 people, more than half of them civilians, while more than 50 soldiers have been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.",Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire begins after year of conflict,Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire begins after year of conflict,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mze4pzdnlo,articles/article_3096.txt,results/article_3096.txt.json

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not hesitate to strike if Hezbollah breaks any part of the agreed deal. There has been no response from the Iran-backed armed group which had been trading fire with Israel since October 2023. Fighting escalated in late September when Israel intensified bombardments and launched a limited ground invasion. It has been Lebanon's deadliest conflict in decades, killing more than 3,823 people say local officials. The ceasefire started overnight on Wednesday as planned. Attacks by both sides were recorded until shortly before the deal came into effect. Israel issued evacuation orders for parts of Beirut four hours before the ceasefire deadline, striking shortly before the deadline. Hezbollah also fired drones into Israel in the hours before fighting stopped. Under the deal announced on Tuesday and brokered by the US, there will be a 60-day period during which Israel will gradually withdraw its troops from Lebanon's south as Lebanese government forces regain control of an area currently held by Hezbollah. It is expected that Hezbollah fighters and weapons will be removed from the area south of the Litani River, a boundary established at the end of the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. ""This announcement will create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes,"" said a joint statement from the US and France - which will be involved in monitoring the implementation of the deal. Israel has claimed the right to respond with military action if Hezbollah breaches the ceasefire. President Biden has echoed this saying Israel ""retains the right to self defence consistent with international law"". ""If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack,"" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu also said ending the fighting against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel's northern neighbour, would allow the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to focus on ""the Iranian threat"".

But with much of the group's missile arsenal now destroyed, the military balance between Iran and Israel appears to have tilted in Israel's favour. Israel and Hezbollah had long been enemies but the past 13 months of fighting were triggered by the war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah started firing rockets into Israel a day after its Gaza ally Hamas carried out a wide-ranging attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Netanyahu said ending the fighting in Lebanon would also isolate and increase pressure on Hamas. ""From day two of the war, Hamas was counting on Hezbollah to fight by its side. With Hezbollah out of the picture, Hamas is left on its own,"" Netanyahu said. He said ending fighting in Lebanon would also give the IDF space to resupply weapons, munitions and troops. Israeli commentators had noted that the country's military was not ready nor equipped to fight two wars on two fronts over an extended period of time. Ending the conflict in Lebanon thus could also free up more Israeli forces to serve in Gaza, a conflict which shows no sign of ending. At the White House on Tuesday, Biden was asked about a ceasefire in Gaza and said his government was working with other negotiators Turkey, Egypt and Qatar to ""make another push"" on a deal. The US, Israel's key backer, had led the charge with France in negotiating the deal in Lebanon. France, which administered Lebanon for more than 20 years in the last century, is also a  long-term ally and is expected to be involved through the monitoring of the truce. Biden confirmed that no US troops would be deployed to managing the ceasefire. The war has been devastating for Lebanon, where, in addition to the 3,823 people killed and 15,859 injured, one million residents have been displaced in areas where Hezbollah holds sway.

Hezbollah attacks on Israel and the occupied Golan Heights have killed at least 75 people, more than half of them civilians, while more than 50 soldiers have been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities. The World Bank estimates $8.5bn (£6.8bn) in economic losses and damage in Lebanon. Recovery will take time, and it is unknown how this will be funded. Hezbollah, too, has been devastated. Many of its leaders have been killed, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, in an IDF strike on Beirut on 27 September. A week later Israel also killed his presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, in another strike. With much of its infrastructure also damaged, how Hezbollah will look after the war remains unclear. The group has been severely weakened but it has not been destroyed. In Lebanon, it is also more than a militia: it is a political party with representation in parliament, and a social organisation, with significant support among Shia Muslims. Hezbollah’s opponents could see it as an opportunity to limit its influence - it was often described as “a state within a state” in Lebanon before the conflict - and many fear this could lead to internal violence. Since intensifying the fighting in September, Israel has carried out hundreds of daily strikes in Lebanon, targeting what it said were Hezbollah areas in the south, east and in the capital Beirut. As reports emerged that Netanyahu was discussing a ceasefire deal with his cabinet on Tuesday, the IDF continued its strikes - targeting Beirut with strikes that killed at least 10 people.","Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal agreed, confirms Biden","Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal agreed, confirms Biden",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c75lpzq0re1o,articles/article_3097.txt,results/article_3097.txt.json
3098,2024-10-01 17:16:44.980000+00:00,/news/articles/c9vp7dg3ml1o,"A ceasefire has come into effect between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon after a deal was agreed to end 13 months of fighting. In October 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza and Israel launched retaliatory air strikes in Lebanon. The conflict escalated in late September 2024, when Israel launched an intense air campaign and ground invasion of southern Lebanon. In Lebanon, more than 3,800 people have been killed since October 2023, according to Lebanese authorities, with one million people forced to flee their homes. On the Israeli side, at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed, while 60,000 people have been displaced, Israeli authorities say. Follow live updates on this storyWhat we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire dealQuestions over Hezbollah's future after ceasefireIsraeli anger at 'irresponsible and hasty' ceasefireWatch: People in Israel and Lebanon react to ceasefire deal Lebanon is a small country with a population of about 5.5 million people, which borders Syria to the north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. It is about 170km (105 miles) away from Cyprus. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah must end its armed presence in the area of southern Lebanon between the Blue Line - the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Over the next 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon and thousands of Lebanese army troops will move into the vacated positions in parallel, the agreement says. The Lebanese army will ensure that Hezbollah's infrastructure or weaponry is removed and that it cannot be rebuilt, according to a senior US official. Under UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last war in 2006, the area south of the Litani should be free of any armed personnel or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state and the UN peacekeeping force (Unifil). However, both sides claimed violations of the resolution. The US and France will join the existing tripartite mechanism, involving Unifil, Lebanon and Israel, which will be charged with monitoring violations, the senior US official said. The agreement also says that “these commitments do not preclude either Israel or Lebanon from exercising their inherent right of self-defence, consistent with international law”. Israel’s prime minister insisted it would “maintain full freedom of military action” to attack Hezbollah if it violated the agreement. Tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians displaced by the war have started returning to their homes in the south, despite being warned by the Israeli military that it was not safe to return to areas where its soldiers were still deployed. Israel launched its ground invasion of southern Lebanon on the night of 30 September 2024, with troops and tanks crossing the border in several locations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was carrying out ""limited, localised, and targeted ground raids"" to dismantle what it called Hezbollah's “terrorist infrastructure”. Analysis by experts at the Institute for the Study of War suggests Israeli ground operations were limited to areas within a few kilometres of the border, as shown in the map below. The IDF warned people living in dozens of towns and villages in southern Lebanon to leave their homes and head north of the Awali River, which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel. Lebanese civilians were also told by the IDF not to use vehicles to travel south of the Litani River. The IDF carried out air strikes in Lebanon throughout the conflict. But it sharply escalated the air campaign on 23 September 2024, when it launched an operation targeting what it said were Hezbollah infrastructure sites and weapons in all areas of the country where the group has a strong presence. However, Lebanese authorities say more than 700 women and 200 children have been killed since the start of the conflict, as well as another 200 people working in the country's health sector. As the chart below shows, the intensity of the strikes stepped up significantly in the weeks before the Israeli ground invasion in late September and peaked in October.  The majority of Israeli strikes were in southern Lebanon, where about a million people lived before the conflict escalated over a year ago. The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which areas of Lebanon sustained the most concentrated damage during the conflict. As the following map shows, Beirut was also heavily targeted by Israeli air strikes. There were some strikes close to central Beirut but the majority of them hit the southern suburbs of the city - densely populated areas that were home to hundreds of thousands of civilians. These areas, close to the international airport, have a strong Hezbollah presence and it was a series of strikes on buildings there that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on 27 September. There were several dozens air strikes in the southern suburbs and central Beirut on 26 November hours before the ceasefire deal was agreed. Israel has a decades-long history of conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon but it is just one of the fronts that it is currently engaged in hostilities. The others include armed forces and non-state armed groups in several countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Syria and Iran-backed groups operating in Gaza, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.",Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon,Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vp7dg3ml1o,articles/article_3098.txt,results/article_3098.txt.json

He told his three children not to be scared as the bulldozer pushed up against their front wall, smashing through the staircase and balcony. ""The bulldozer kept coming closer to the house,"" he said. ""It lifted the rubble near those two windows above. It was trying to hit them. ""Residents living near the entrances to Nur Shams often leave when they hear the Israeli army is coming. I asked Majdi why he stayed. ""Why would I leave?"" he said. ""We won't leave. We are staying here. We either go back to our lands [in what is now Israel] or stay here and die. There are no other options.

Israel's army pulled out of Nur Shams camp on Friday morning, but its wider operation across the north of the occupied West Bank continues - with the aim, Israel says, of dismantling the armed groups there. One of the men killed during the operation was 69-year-old Ayed Abu Hajja, who was disabled and a long-term resident of Nur Shams. He was shot by a sniper, neighbours said, when he opened a window in his house. On Friday, his body was carried through the narrow streets to his mother's home, before burial. A large crowd of young men gathered to escort his body to the cemetery - but others were there to honour someone else. Groups of young men filed silently past the crowd with their weapons - to a separate, symbolic burial for their leader, Mohammed Jaber - also killed during the Israeli operation in this cityThe fighter and the civilian, living for years side by side in Nur Shams, remembered side by side in death. One with prayers; the other with bursts of automatic gunfire - a show of force from Tulkarm’s armed fighters, less than a day after Israel’s army withdrew. Inside Nur Shams, Israel’s operation has left war-like destruction in parts of the camp: houses burned out, walls sheared off. Whole buildings collapsed into rubble have opened up new, sloping and precarious routes between the camp's main streets. A child of six or seven, dwarfed by a mountain of concrete boulders, reaches gently in to pick out a bright yellow toy walkie-talkie from the remains of his grandmother’s house. Standing nearby is his grandmother’s next-door neighbour, Fadwa Abu Ayad, her path to the street cut off by the rubble mountain. The army also came to her house, she said. ""They told us that we have tunnels like in Gaza, and smuggle the armed groups to this house,"" Fadwa said. I asked her if that was true. ""It's impossible,"" she replied. ""He brought a drill and dug into the floor. All he found was a sewer hole. ""Fadwa takes us through another entrance to her house, and shows us the broken floor - beneath it is a small pipe and what appears to be a sewer drain. It's too small for a person to fit through. ""What is happening in the [West Bank] camps now is like a small version of Gaza,"" Fadwa said. ""Ever since 7 October,"" she added, referring to the day of Hamas's deadly attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. Down another shattered street, paved with broken glass and burned pieces of rubble, I hear a voice at the window above me. It turns out to be Umm Yazan. She says the army laid wires from her home to blow up two of the houses opposite – families she has known for decades. ""I have 10-year-old triplets, and they trapped us in a room,” she told me. ""Then they started the explosions - five explosions in total. Imagine the walls shaking and your young children clinging to you. It feels like we’re in Gaza. ""Israel says this is a counter-terrorist operation, to dismantle Palestinian armed groups it says are funded and armed by Iran.  But Umm Yazan replies that it is the army's responsibility to target fighters, and not involve families like hers. ""Are there fighters in my house? I have young children, my husband has an Israeli work permit. My house is a safe house. ""You hear comparisons with Gaza a lot here now. The grinding conflict between Israel and armed Palestinian groups in the West Bank is still very different to the Gaza war, but that war has changed attitudes and tactics here - on both sides.

The director of a local hospital said children and women were among the casualties from the attack on Abu Hussein Primary School for Boys in Jabalia refugee camp. Video footage showed people carrying a number of casualties and fetching buckets of water in an attempt to put out a blaze inside a tent. The Israeli military said it had “conducted a precise strike on an operational meeting point for Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists”. It also named 12 men who it said were among “dozens” of members of the Palestinian armed groups present in the compound at the time of the strike. The military accused them of being involved in rocket attacks on Israel and of carrying out attacks on Israeli troops in Gaza in recent days. Hamas rejected the allegation that the school was being used for military purposes as “mere lies” and part of a “systematic policy of the enemy to justify its crime”. The director of the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, told the BBC in a voice note that about 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the strike, and that children and women were among the casualties who had been brought there. ""Our hospital is small in size and we cannot receive all these injured people. Most of the people presented to us were women or children,"" he said. The town of Jabalia and its refugee camp have seen intense Israeli bombardment and fierce fighting on the ground since the Israeli military launched a ground offensive 12 days ago to target what it said were Hamas fighters regrouping there. More than 50,000 people have fled their homes in response to the hostilities and Israeli evacuation orders, but UN officials say there are tens of thousands who are stuck there in increasingly desperate conditions with water and food running out. Kamal Adwan hospital, along with the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals, are facing dire shortages of fuel and other supplies, according to the UN. ""We are working under fear, under the sound of explosions everywhere. We have a big challenge in our hospital,"" Dr Abu Safiya said. ""We have a lack of medicine, a lack of medical supplies, a lack of medical equipment. We don't have enough staff, especially specialists for our ER. ""For the first two weeks of this month, the UN said no humanitarian supplies entered northern Gaza from Israel’s crossings. Aid lorries began to go in this week after a sternly worded letter was sent by the Biden administration, warning Israel that if it did not increase aid getting into Gaza within 30 days it risked losing US military assistance. Israel said it was not preventing the entry of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas accused of hijacking and stealing aid deliveries - something the group has denied. On Thursday, a UN-backed assessment warned that “the risk of famine persists across the whole Gaza Strip”, adding: “Given the recent surge in hostilities, there are growing concerns that this worst-case scenario may materialize. ”The report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), external said about 1.84 million people were experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, with 664,000 of them facing “emergency” levels of hunger and almost 133,000 facing “catastrophic” levels. The last figure is three-quarters lower than at the time of the last report in June - a fall the IPC attributed to a temporary surge in humanitarian assistance and commercial supplies between May and August. However, the IPC said it expected the number of people facing “catastrophic” hunger to nearly triple in the coming months because there had been a sharp decline in aid deliveries and food availability since September. In response to the report, UN Secretary General António Guterres said on X: “Famine looms. This is intolerable. Crossing points must open immediately, bureaucratic impediments must be removed, and law and order restored so UN agencies can deliver lifesaving humanitarian assistance. ”Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Israeli air strike on north Gaza school kills at least 22, medics say","Israeli air strike on north Gaza school kills at least 22, medics say","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ced07pj0q6no,articles/article_3100.txt,results/article_3100.txt.json

Thousands of families have also fled their homes as the Israeli military said it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets in an operation to destroy infrastructure that the armed group had built up since the 2006 war. Hezbollah, meanwhile, launched more than 200 rockets into northern Israel, according to the military. Paramedics said two people were injured by shrapnel. World powers have been urging restraint as both sides appear to be spiralling closer towards all-out war. Lebanon's health ministry said 35 children and 58 women were among the dead, while 1,645 others had been wounded. It did not report how many of the casualties were civilians or combatants. Health Minister Firass Abiad said thousands of families had also been displaced by the strikes. UN Secretary General António Guterres expressed alarm at the escalating situation and said he did not want Lebanon to “become another Gaza”. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the ""escalation is extremely dangerous and worrying"" ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the UN in New York, adding ""we are almost in a full-fledged war"". President Joe Biden said the US was “working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely”, while the Pentagon announced it was sending “a small number” of additional troops to the Middle East ""out of an abundance of caution"". Nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. The Pentagon said it was sending “a small number” of additional US troops to the Middle East amid the growing crisis. ""In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,"" said Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder in a briefing with reporters. He would not answer any follow-up questions on the specifics. Early on Tuesday, the IDF said it had detected 20 launches from Lebanon overnight ""in the valleys area"", adding some were intercepted by air defense fighters and others fell in open areas. ""Air Force aircraft attacked the sources of the fire,"" it added on X. Lebanese media said the first wave of Israeli air strikes began at around 06:30 local time (03:30 GMT) on Monday. “It was horrifying, the missiles flew over our heads. We woke up to the sound of bombings, we didn’t expect this,” one woman said. Dozens of towns, villages and open areas were targeted throughout the day in the districts of Sidon, Marjayoun, Nabatieh, Bint Jbeil, Tyre, Jezzine and Zahrani in southern Lebanon, as well as the Zahle, Baalbek and Hermel districts in the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA). In the evening, it reported that a building in the Bir al-Abed area of the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, was hit by several missiles. Lebanese security sources said the strike targeted Hezbollah’s top commander in southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, but that it was not clear whether he was killed. Hezbollah’s media office said Karaki was “fine” and had “moved to a safe place”. From the south to Beirut, roads were congested as people desperately tried to leave amid the bombardment and after receiving audio and text messages from the Israeli military warning them to move away immediately from buildings where Hezbollah was storing weapons. A family of four riding on a motorbike spoke to the BBC in Beirut during a brief stop on their way to the northern city of Tripoli. ""What do you want us to say? We just had to flee,"" the father said anxiously. Information Minister Ziad Makary said his ministry had received an Israeli phone call urging it to evacuate its building in Beirut. However, he insisted that it would not comply with what he called “a psychological war”. Prime Minister Najib Mikati, meanwhile, told a cabinet meeting: “The continued Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word. ”“We are working as a government to stop this new Israeli war and to avoid descending into the unknown,” he added. On Monday night Israel said it killed a ""large number"" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,600 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon. “Essentially, we are targeting combat infrastructure that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years. This is very significant,” the IDF’s Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, told commanders in Tel Aviv. “Ultimately, everything is focused on creating the conditions to return the residents of the north to their homes. ”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said videos from southern Lebanon showed ""significant secondary explosions caused by Hezbollah’s weapons that were being stored inside the buildings"". ""It is likely that some of the casualties are from these secondary explosions,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the people of Lebanon to “get out of harm's way now”. “For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage,” he said. “To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out these weapons. ”A senior Israeli military official insisted that the IDF was “currently focusing on Israel’s aerial campaign only” after being asked by reporters if a ground invasion of southern Lebanon was imminent to create a buffer zone. The official said Israel had three aims - to degrade Hezbollah's ability to fire rockets and missiles over the Lebanon-Israel border, to push its fighters back from the frontier, and to destroy the infrastructure built by Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force which could be used to attack Israeli communities. Hezbollah did not comment on the Israeli claims that it had hidden weapons in houses, and its media office had announced the death of only one fighter by Monday evening. But in a sign that it is unlikely to back down, it said it had responded to the “Israeli enemy’s attacks” by firing barrages of rockets at several Israeli military bases in northern Israel, as well as a weapons manufacturing facility in the coastal Zvulun area, north of the city of Haifa. The IDF said 210 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon by the evening, and that an unspecified number had landed in the Lower Galilee and Upper Galilee regions, in Haifa and the nearby areas of Carmel, HaAmakim and Hamifratz areas, and in the occupied Golan Heights. One house was badly damaged by a rocket in Givat Avni, in the Lower Galilee. Resident David Yitzhak told the BBC that he, his wife and six-year-old daughter were unharmed because they had managed to get behind the solid door of the house's safe room seconds earlier, when a warning siren sounded. “It’s a metre from life to death,” he said. Israel’s ambulance service said it treated two people with shrapnel wounds in the Lower and Upper Galilee regions, and that another person was injured as they rushed to a shelter. Early on Tuesday, the IDF said it had detected 20 launches from Lebanon overnight ""in the valleys area"", adding some were intercepted by air defense fighters and others fell in open areas. ""Air Force aircraft attacked the sources of the fire,"" it added on X. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched more than 150 rockets and drones across the border, while Israeli jets struck hundreds of targets across southern Lebanon. Hezbollah remains a powerful force, despite being weakened by what Israel’s defence minister described as “the most difficult week” for the group since its establishment. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded. And on Friday, Hezbollah said at least 16 members, including top commanders of its elite Radwan Force, were among 45 people killed in an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut. Speaking at a funeral on Sunday, Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said the group would not be deterred. ""We have entered a new phase,” he said, “the title of which is the open-ended battle of reckoning. ""On the streets of Beirut, one young man told the BBC that he was ""very scared of the war escalating"" because it would “ cause a lot of disaster, it will stop students going to university"". But another man was defiant, saying: ""We're not scared, we have to stand tall, we have to defend ourselves.

3102,2024-12-03 16:50:48.459000+00:00,/news/articles/c98ly11k9rwo,"The latest exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah is testing the limits of last week’s already fragile ceasefire deal. Hours after Hezbollah fired two mortar shells at an Israeli military outpost on Monday, Israel carried out its largest series of air strikes since the truce came into effect. Nine people were killed in two villages in southern Lebanon. “Yesterday was the most dangerous moment for the cessation of hostilities,” said one seasoned observer in Lebanon. The Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah fighters, rocket launchers and infrastructure.  However, in a statement it added, that: “The State of Israel remains obligated to the fulfilment of the conditions of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. ”Both sides have accused each other of violating the truce brokered by the US and France in recent days. Under its terms, Israel is prohibited from conducting offensive military operations in Lebanon while Lebanon must prevent armed groups, including Hezbollah, from launching attacks on Israel. The Israeli army did not report any casualties from the mortar attack on its position in the sensitive Shebaa Farms area – along the border of Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. However, soon afterwards, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a “strong” response.   There were also fiery comments from the Defence Minister, Israel Katz: “If the ceasefire collapses, there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,” he said on Tuesday. “We will enforce the agreement with maximum response and zero tolerance; If until now we have separated Lebanon and Hezbollah - it will not be anymore"". Hezbollah said its mortar attack – the first operation which it had announced since the ceasefire came into effect last Wednesday – was a “warning” in response to repeated violations by Israel. It launched the missiles after Israel fired artillery shells and conducted at least four air strikes that killed two people, Lebanese media reported: a person on a motorbike and a member of the Lebanese security forces. In a statement Hezbollah this was a defensive move “given that appeals to the relevant authorities to stop these (Israeli) violations have proven futile,” an apparent reference to an international committee meant to monitor the truce. “This is an affirmation that the party remains strong and ready for any developments,” says Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese political writer specialising in Islamist movements. “The key lies in activating the work of the international committee, ensuring the deployment of the Lebanese army, the withdrawal [of Israeli forces] from occupied Lebanese territories, and halting Israeli violations. ”Paula Yaacoubian, an independent member of Lebanon’s parliament, said Hezbollah probably fired the missiles to send a message. “I think it can be just to tell Israel ‘we’re still here, and we can still fire’, so that Israel stops [its attacks],” she told the BBC. “It’s becoming embarrassing to Hezbollah to get all these violations and not even respond with anything. ” She fled Israeli bombing four times. It still found herFamilies return to destruction in southern LebanonLebanon ceasefire under strain after Israeli strikes and Hezbollah mortar fire Ms Yaacoubian said the question of whether the war will resume “is in the hands of Israel, not Hezbollah. ”“I think Hezbollah needs to gather its forces together, to see where the region is heading,” she added. Lebanon’s parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who represented his country in truce talks, said at least 54 ceasefire breaches by Israel had been recorded.  He said these included air strikes, demolishing homes near the border and violating Lebanese airspace. He urged the monitoring commission to “urgently” ensure that Israel adhere to the deal. Israel says its strikes are a response to Hezbollah violations allowed under the terms of the agreement.  Its foreign minister, Gideon Saar, has accused Hezbollah of taking the prohibited step of moving weapons south of the Litani River. Much now depends on the international committee which is meant to verify claims of ceasefire breaches and facilitate communication between the parties. It will be co-chaired by a US army general, Jasper Jeffers, who arrived in Beirut last week, and Amos Hochstein, the senior advisor to President Joe Biden who was a key player in negotiating the truce. The committee also includes representatives from France, the Israeli and Lebanese militaries, and the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (Unifil). It is still getting organized, but the BBC understands the aim is to have all the members in place later this week so that it can hold its first meeting. On Monday, Biden administration officials focused on the success of the truce. “Largely speaking… the ceasefire is holding,” said White House national security spokesman, John Kirby. “We went from hundreds of rocket attacks to basically zero by Hezbollah and dozens of air strikes by Israel to one or two a day.  So there’s been a dramatic reduction in the violence. ”He summed up: “There’s a lot of work to do. ”Additional reporting by Rawad Salameh",Israeli and Hezbollah strikes test limits of ceasefire,Israeli and Hezbollah strikes test limits of ceasefire,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98ly11k9rwo,articles/article_3102.txt,results/article_3102.txt.json
3103,2024-09-19 08:44:23.874000+00:00,/news/articles/cvgdn8y89jeo,"An Israeli citizen has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in a plot by Iran to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, Israel's security services say. Israeli police and domestic intelligence said the man was twice smuggled into Iran and received payment to carry out missions. In a joint statement, they said the suspect was a businessman who had lived in Turkey and had Turkish contacts who had helped get him into Iran. The announcement comes at a time of soaring tension between Iran and Israel, regional arch-enemies.  The statement said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested last month. It said his targets were the prime minister, the defence minister and the head of Israel's internal security agency Shin Bet. It said that in April and May, the suspect twice travelled to Samandag in Turkey to meet a wealthy Iranian businessman called Eddie, and was helped by two Turkish citizens. The statement said Eddie had problems leaving Iran on both occasions, so the Israeli citizen was smuggled from Turkey into Iran instead. It said that the man met both Eddie and ""an Iranian security operative"" there. It said Eddie asked the Israeli to ""carry out various security missions within Israel for the Iranian regime"".  According to the statement, these included transferring money or a gun, photographing crowded places in Israel and sending them to ""Iranian elements"", and threatening other Israeli citizens who had been recruited by Iran but had not completed their tasks. At the second rendezvous in Iran, Iranian intelligence agents are said to have asked the Israeli to carry out terrorist activities in Israel, including the assassination of Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Gallant, or Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. According to the investigation, it was also suggested assassinating former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and other public figures, in revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July 2024. Iran blamed Israel for that attack, which Israel neither confirmed nor denied involvement in. Investigators say the Israeli demanded an advance payment of $1m. The group are also alleged to have discussed killing opponents of the Iranian regime in Europe and the US, and recruiting a Mossad operative to become a ""double agent"". The Israeli is alleged to have been paid 5,000 euros ($5,600; £4,200) for the meetings. A senior Shin Bet official said the case ""exemplifies the enormous efforts of Iranian intelligence agents to recruit Israeli citizens to promote terrorist activities in Israel"". Iran and Israel have been major foes since the Islamic revolution brought the current regime to power in Iran in 1979. Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and is a major backer of Israeli adversaries including Hamas and Hezbollah. Hostilities between Iran and Israel have intensified with the war in Gaza, and both sides have carried out direct or indirect attacks on each other in recent months.","Israeli arrested over Iran plot to kill Netanyahu, Israeli security services say","Israeli arrested over Iran plot to kill Netanyahu, Israeli security services say",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgdn8y89jeo,articles/article_3103.txt,results/article_3103.txt.json
3104,2024-10-12 12:34:29.400000+00:00,/news/articles/c1e82yy0wxno,"On Saturday morning, a message was posted on social media by the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman warning people living in the ‘D5’ area of northern Gaza to move south. D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas. The message, external, the latest in a series, said: ""The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area. ""A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using ""great force… for a long time"". In other words, don’t expect to come back any time soon. The humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area. Hamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m.  Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back. Many people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war. Some of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents. One tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return. The IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are in daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south. Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks. One of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that ""they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they’re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance. ”The journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law. But Medical Aid for Palestinians’ head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted. “When we’re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack. ” Once again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Desperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis. The suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the ""Generals’ Plan"".  It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser. Like most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals’ Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel’s perspective, break the deadlock. At its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October. Giora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary. In his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan. “Since we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide. ""And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians… will have two choices either to surrender or to starve. ""Eiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves. The UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a ""disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families"". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire. It is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered. The ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he’s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “Our heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip… to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security. ”",Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war,Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e82yy0wxno,articles/article_3104.txt,results/article_3104.txt.json
3105,2024-11-13 12:04:10.368000+00:00,/news/articles/cpwrvw7x8j9o,"The United Nations says Israeli construction along a demilitarised buffer zone with Syria has led to “severe violations” of a 50-year-old ceasefire agreement, which risk increasing tensions along their shared frontier in the occupied Golan Heights. Satellite photographs show new trenches and earth berms dug over the past few months along the length of what is known as the Area of Separation (AoS). The BBC has filmed construction taking place alongside a military vehicle near the town of Majdal Shams, and fresh earthworks in rural land further south. The work in both locations is believed to lie within Israeli-controlled areas. The UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) says most of the Israeli construction does not breach the AoS, but that some trenches - dug under protection from military vehicles including tanks - do cross into it, and that Israeli army vehicles and personnel have also entered the buffer zone. Beneath the watchtower at UNDOF’s Camp Ziouani base, the Israeli fence snakes towards a line of volcanic mountains; a Syrian flag flutters in the trees beyond the post, marking the other side of the separation zone. UNDOF observers monitor the 80km (50-mile) long strip of land 24 hours a day. Chief of Mission Bernard Lee told the BBC that two major lines of trenches had been dug, along with three more limited ones, each some 6m (20 ft) wide. He estimated that trenches crossed into the AoS in a handful locations, by a couple of metres in each case, but said he had not visited the sites himself. UNDOF was not able to immediately share visual evidence of the reported incursions, and permission for the BBC to view or film the locations from a nearby observation post has so far not been granted. Initial searches of satellite photographs have not produced images in enough detail to independently confirm the UN allegations. The AoS was set up as part of Israel’s ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, following Israel’s earlier occupation of the Golan Heights. Israeli forces are required to be west of the so-called Alpha Line, while Syrian forces must be east of the Bravo Line, which runs along the other side of the AoS. Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so unilaterally in 2019. Israeli settlers there live alongside about 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, who stayed on in the Golan after it was captured. Despite the presence of Iran-backed militia groups in Syria, this frontier has remained relatively calm, as Israeli ground forces have battled Iranian allies in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 13 months. But UNDOF said in a statement that the Syrian authorities had “strongly protested” the ongoing Israeli work. And that the UN itself had “repeatedly” taken its concerns over the Israeli violations to Israel’s military authorities. Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told the BBC that the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria - and did not break the ceasefire agreement. “Israeli officials have been communicating with the UN about these issues,” he said. “And I can tell you that the IDF is operating on Israeli territory making sure that a terror invasion is not possible, making sure we are defending our borders. ” The threat of a surprise invasion by Israel’s neighbours has loomed larger here since the 7 October Hamas attacks. “Will [the trenches] stop what happened on 7 October? Yes,” said Bernard Lee.  “Could you get a pick-up truck over it? No. ”But the defences being built along this frontier don’t address the more immediate threat from drones and missiles regularly launched by Iranian militia groups in Syria and Iraq – and frequently shot down by Israeli forces. Nor do they address Israel’s concerns about Syria being an “oxygen line” for Iran to smuggle weapons to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Mr Lee said commercial smugglers already used the AoS to smuggle cigarettes and electronics between Syria and Lebanon. And that a new patrol road, built by the UN, is assisting them. “They come over the mountain, enter the area of separation with a trail of pack horses, eight at a time, with two armed guys,” he said. “They unload the pack horses and a pick-up truck meets them at our road: we’ve motorized the smuggling business. ”Asked whether the same route could be used to take weapons from Syria into Lebanon, he replied: “That is what the IDF are concerned about. ” Israel has also pointed to what it says are “daily” violations along the demilitarized frontier by Syria. In May, Israel’s ambassador to the UN wrote to the secretary-general to complain about Syrian violations, including “armed presence in the area of separation” which “only heighten tensions in our already volatile region”. Iran-backed militia in the area are a concern for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, too, after years of civil war. It has appeared unwilling to be drawn in to the Israel-Hezbollah war, despite frequent Israeli strikes inside Syria targeting Hezbollah and Iranian positions and weapons shipments. “The situation is frightening,” said Wafik Farhat, a Syrian hotel owner in the occupied Golan Heights. “Our eyes are looking more to the sky than to the plants. There’s fear here. ”Farhat’s eco-lodge, with its yurt accommodation surrounded by orchards, looks out onto rows of fresh trenches along the buffer zone. “It gives us a sense of security,” he said. “We can sleep in peace, because there’s someone taking care of the border and not letting terrorists cross towards us. ”Israel is already fighting Iranian allies - Hamas and Hezbollah - on two of its borders. But more than a year into this regional conflict, friction is also being felt along its quietest frontier.

Andrea Tenenti from UNIFL says that the IDF are currently a few hundred metres from camp UN-652, reports the Irish state broadcaster RTÉ. The proximity of the IDF to Irish UN troops has caused high levels of concern within United Nations Headquarters as fighting continues between Israel and Hezbollah. President Michael D Higgins said it is ""outrageous"" that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has ""threatened"" UNIFIL peacekeepers and attempted to have them evacuated from the villages they are defending in Lebanon. Mr Tenenti, who is in Beirut, told RTÉ that efforts are being made in New York to deal with the Israeli permanent mission to the UN in order to get IDF soldiers to move away from the area as their presence compromises the safety of UNIFIL troops. If the IDF refuse to leave the area, the [UN] Security Council will decide how to move forward, Mr Tenenti added. Mr Tenenti explained that troops at the outpost have supplies for a couple of weeks and a convoy is heading to the area and de-escalate the situation. He said there is also concern for troops from other countries as there are 29 other positions that are based near the ""blue line"". Drawn by the United Nations, the Blue Line is the 120km demarcation line where Israeli pulled back to when they left south Lebanon in 2000. A former Lieutenant Colonel with the Air Corps, Kevin Byrne has told RTÉ's News at One that troops are in a precarious position due to where the UNIFL are stationed. He said that the electricity supply could become problematic as the generators will need re-fuelled to operate and the troops may need a re-stock of food shortly. However Mr Byrne noted that the UNIFIL troops have a high standard of equipment and accommodation. On the anniversary of the 7 October attacks in the Middle East, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have called for an end to the violence. Taoiseach Simon Harris condemned the attack on Israel carried out by Hamas and has called for the remaining hostages that were taken on 7 October 2023 to be released without conditions. He said: ""We cannot, and we will not, ever forget. Neither can we ever tolerate a world in which civilians are systematically subjected to the most brutal violence in their homes, or in which vibrant and peaceful young people at a music festival are terrorised, murdered and abducted. ""They are despicable and criminal acts, beyond any sense of humanity or decency. I condemn them utterly and without hesitation. ""He paid tribute to families and friends of those murdered, particularly 22-year-old Kim Damti, the Irish-Israeli woman who died at the music festival. Also condemning the attack on the 7 October is Tánaiste Micheál Martin who says that the violence must end and a political process needs to begin. He said: ""I think today of the hostages still in Gaza and their families who desperately want them home. I call again for their immediate release,""I recognise the hurt and sorrow of the Israeli people, and of the Jewish and Israeli communities here in Ireland and throughout the world. ""I express our profound sympathy to all who are mourning loved ones brutally murdered, and think especially of the family and friends of Kim Damti. "" Martin added: ""It is not possible to view this anniversary in isolation from the justifiable outrage at the death and destruction suffered by ordinary Palestinians in Gaza over the past 12 months. ""Ireland's position is clear and on the record. The violence must stop.

3107,2024-09-06 11:37:36.106000+00:00,/news/articles/cpdl751l3djo,"Israeli forces have withdrawn from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank after a major nine-day operation there. The area - a stronghold of militants and with a civilian population of about 60,000 - was targeted in one of the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) biggest actions in the West Bank for years. The IDF said it was acting against terrorism. At least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - the Palestinian health ministry says. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. An Israeli soldier was also killed during fighting in Jenin. The city of Tubas and al-Faraa refugee camp were also raided during the operation across the northern West Bank - the deadliest of its kind since the start of the war in Gaza last October triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel. Hundreds of troops from several branches of the security forces were involved, with civilians confined to their homes and utilities cut as the Israeli military battled with militants on the ground and with air strikes. Also on Friday in the West Bank, a 26-year-old American woman, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was shot dead in the occupied West Bank during a protest in the town of Beita near Nablus. Following the Israeli withdrawal from Jenin refugee camp, residents are emerging into the streets for the first time since the IDF began its assault on 27 August. Many, stunned and exhausted, slowly assessed the damage - the new layers of destruction mapping this operation onto the camp. Khalid abu Sabeer lives in a basement apartment next to the mosque. The entire floor of his home, he said, was blown out by a powerful explosion. The Israeli army was interested in a cave beneath the building, he said, that had been there for decades, empty. The IDF asked him to leave before blowing it up – and his home along with it. Another resident of the camp, Mustafa Antir, described intense attacks from Israel. “It was impossible to tell where it was coming from: explosions, drones, shooting.  Here and here and here, and from the sky. You can’t imagine how heavy it was. ”Years of violent confrontation between the Israeli army and Palestinian armed groups have been etched into Jenin's narrow pathways – bullet-holes scattered across walls, piles of rubble left by military bulldozers, graffiti in the shape of M16 rifles, along with the name ""Hamas"". Among the destruction is a hole in the middle of the city centre – the main road broken and impassable. Construction vehicles dig whole tree trunks out of the shattered road and cart them away. Shop owners and photojournalists clamber over the rubble to inspect the damage. On either side, a crowd has paused to watch the rebuilding: residents on foot, on scooters, on bicycles, out on the streets for the first time in more than nine days. The head of Jenin’s government hospital, Dr Wissam Bakr, who is also there, says the first four days of the Israeli operation were the hardest for the hospital, with power and water supplies cut. They were relying on generators and water tanks, he said, with two new-borns and two elderly patients on ventilators. Further down the same road, the sounds of the city have returned: stallholders are back at the edge of the marketplace, hawking carts full of fresh fruit and vegetables; the cafes around packed with generations of men and boys. On Friday morning, gunfire erupted again in the refugee camp, signalling the start of many funerals taking place. The BBC understands at least eight of the dead are civilians, including a 16-year-old girl. At the funeral of Mohammed Zubeidi, one of five militants killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in Tubas on Thursday, a Palestinian fighter spoke defiantly. ""When you see the Israelis kill your brother, kill this or that person, how do you – in your heart – stay sitting and looking at all of this?"" he said to the BBC. ""People are afraid that they’re coming to destroy their homes, or arrest them, but so what? Let them arrest everyone – my brother has been arrested for two years. So what?”The IDF said Zubeidi was “a significant terrorist from the Jenin area”. He was also the son of Zakaria Zubeidi, the imprisoned former commander in Jenin of the Fatah movement’s armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. In a statement, the Israeli military said that in the Jenin area ""14 terrorists [had] been eliminated, over 30 suspects [had] been apprehended, [and] approximately 30 explosives planted under roads were dismantled"" during the operation. It said it had also dismantled what it called ""numerous terror infrastructure sites. . .  including an underground weapons storage facility located beneath a mosque, and a lab used to manufacture explosives"" and had removed ""large quantities of weapons"". The Palestinian health ministry says three Palestinians have also been killed in the southern governorate of Hebron over the past nine days. The Israeli military said one of them carried out a shooting attack that killed three Israeli police officers near Tarqumiyah on Sunday. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, the Palestinian health ministry says. Israel says it is trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel.",Israeli forces pull out of Jenin after major operation,Israeli forces pull out of Jenin after major operation,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdl751l3djo,articles/article_3107.txt,results/article_3107.txt.json
3108,2024-10-04 23:15:21.201000+00:00,/news/articles/c30305l5jqpo,"A few metres from a charred home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Simon King tends to a patch of ground in the sunshine. The streets around him are eerily quiet, the silence punctuated only by the sound of air strikes that ring in the near distance. In this community almost a year ago, 101 people were killed after gunmen from Hamas and other groups rampaged through Be'eri's tree-lined streets, burning homes and shooting people indiscriminately. Another 30 residents and their family members were taken to Gaza as hostages. Survivors hid in safe rooms all day and long into the night - exchanging horrifying details with each other over community WhatsApp groups, as they tried to make sense of what was happening. The kibbutz was a strong community, where people lived and operated together as one. Neighbours were more like extended family. It is one of a small number of kibbutzim in Israel that still operates as a collective. But now, post-7 October, the collective is splintered - psychologically and physically. About one in 10 were killed. Only a few of the survivors have returned to their homes. Some travel back to the kibbutz daily to work, but can't face overnight stays. Many, after months in a hotel, are now living in prefabricated buildings on another kibbutz 40km (25 miles) away. The community, built up over nearly 80 years, is being tested like never before, and its future is uncertain. There are reminders everywhere of those who didn't survive - says Dafna Gerstner, who grew up in Be'eri, and spent 19 terrifying hours on 7 October holed up in a safe room - designed to protect residents from rocket attacks. Latest coverage as Israel strikes Gaza and BeirutGaza Strip in maps: How life in the territory has been upendedJournalists from across the BBC reflect on the year-long warNew accounts reveal how one military base was overrunJeremy Bowen: Middle East is at the edge of a deeper, wider war ""You look to the left and it's like, 'Oh it's my friend who lost her parents. ' You look to the right, 'It's my friend who lost her father,' [and then] 'She lost her mother. ' It's everywhere you look. ""Inside Be'eri, surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire, you are never far from a house completely burnt or destroyed, or an empty patch of land where a home, wrecked that day, has been demolished. Some streets might, upon first glance, appear almost untouched - but look closely and even there you will see markings spray-painted on walls by military units on or after 7 October. Houses where people were killed or kidnapped have black banners on the facades with their names and photos. In the carcass of one burnt-out home, a board game rests on top of a coffee table, next to a melted television remote control. Food, long-rotten, is still in the fridge-freezer and the smell of burning lingers. ""Time stood still in the house,"" says Dafna, 40, as she pokes through the ash-covered wreckage. She and her family had been playing that board game on the eve of the attacks. Here, her disabled father and his Filipina carer hid for hours in their fortified safe room, as their home burned down around them. Dafna says it is a miracle they both survived. Her brother did not. A member of Be'eri's emergency response squad, he was killed in a gunfight at the kibbutz's dental clinic. Dafna was staying in his house at the time, on a visit from her home in Germany. Dozens of buildings in Be'eri are spattered with bullet holes - including the nursery. The play park and petting zoo are empty. No children have moved back, and the animals have been sent to new homes. The kibbutz's empty streets sometimes come alive, though, in a surprising way - with organised tours for visitors, who give donations. Israeli soldiers, and some civilians from Israel and abroad, come to see the broken homes, and hear accounts of the devastation, in order to understand what happened. Two of those who volunteer to lead the tours, Rami Gold and Simon King, say they are determined to ensure what happened here is remembered. Simon, 60, admits this can be a difficult process. ""There's a lot of mixed feelings and [the visitors] don't really know what to ask but they can see and hear and smell… it's a very heavy emotional experience. ""Rami, 70, says these occasions are often followed by restless nights. Each tour, he says, takes him back to 7 October. He is one of the few who moved back to Be'eri after the attacks. And the tours are not popular with everyone. ""At some point it felt like someone took over the kibbutz - everybody was there,"" Dafna says. But Simon says the stories have to be told. ""Some don't like it because it's their home and you don’t want people rummaging around,"" he says. ""But you have to send the message out, otherwise it will be forgotten. ""At the same time, both he and Rami say they are looking to the future, describing themselves as ""irresponsible optimists"". They continue to water the lawns and fix fences, amid the destruction, as others build new homes that will replace those destroyed. Simon describes the rebuilding as therapy. Established in 1946, Be’eri is one of 11 Jewish communities in this region set up before the creation of the state of Israel. It was known for its left-leaning views, and many of its residents believed in, and advocated for, peace with the Palestinians. After the attacks, many residents were moved into a hotel by the Dead Sea - the David Hotel - some 90 minutes' drive away. In the aftermath of the attacks, I witnessed their trauma. Shell-shocked residents gathered in the lobby and other communal areas, as they tried to make sense of what had happened, and who they had lost, in hushed conversations. Some children clung to their parents as they spoke. Still now, they say, the conversations have not moved on. ""Every person I speak to from Be'eri - it always goes back to this day. Every conversation is going back to dealing with it and the effects after it. We are always talking about it again and again and again,"" says Shir Guttentag. Like her friend Dafna, Shir was holed up that day in her safe room, attempting to reassure terrified neighbours on the WhatsApp group as Hamas gunmen stormed through the kibbutz, shooting residents and setting homes on fire. Shir twice dismantled the barricade of furniture she had made against her front door to let neighbours in to hide. She told her children, ""it's OK, it's going to be OK"" as they waited to be rescued. When they were eventually escorted to safety, she looked down at the ground, not wanting to see the remains of her community. In the coming months at the Dead Sea hotel, Shir says she struggled as people began to leave - some to homes elsewhere in the country or to stay with families, others seeking to escape their memories by heading abroad. Each departure was like ""another break-up, another goodbye"", she says. It is no longer unusual to see someone who is crying or looking sad among Be'eri's grieving residents. ""In normal days it would have been like, 'What happened? Are you OK?' Nowadays everyone can cry and no-one asks him why,” Shir says. Shir and her daughters, along with hundreds of other Be'eri survivors, have now moved to new, identical prefabricated homes, paid for by the Israeli government, on an expanse of barren land at another kibbutz, Hatzerim - about 40-minutes drive from Be'eri. I was there on moving day. It feels a world away from the manicured lawns of Be'eri, though grass has now been planted around the neighbourhood. When single mother Shir led her daughters, aged nine and six, into their new bungalow, she told me her stomach was turning from excitement and nerves. She checked the door to the safe room, where her children will sleep every night, noting that it felt heavier than the door at Be'eri. ""I don't know if it's bulletproof. I hope so,"" she said. She chose not to bring many items from Be'eri because she wants to keep her home there as it was - and to remind herself that she will one day return. The mass move to Hatzerim happened after it was put to a community vote - as is the case with all major kibbutz decisions. It is estimated about 70% of Be'eri's survivors will live there for the time being. About half of the kibbutz's residents have moved in so far, but more homes are on the way. The journey from Hatzerim to Be'eri is shorter than it was from the hotel - and many people make the trip every day, to work in one of the kibbutz's businesses, as they did before. Shir travels to Be'eri to work at its veterinary clinic, but can't imagine returning to live there yet. ""I don't know what needs to happen, but something drastic, so I can feel safe again. "" In the middle of the day, the Be'eri lunch hall fills with people as they gather to eat together. Shir, like many others, has reluctantly applied for a gun licence, never wanting to be caught off-guard again. ""It's for my daughters and myself because, on the day, I didn’t have anything,"" she says. Her mother's long-term partner was killed that day. When they talk about it, her mother says: ""They destroyed us. "" Residents say they have relied on the support of their neighbours over the past year, but individual trauma has also tested a community that has historically operated as a collective. The slogan at Be'eri is adapted from Karl Marx: ""Everyone gives as much as he can and everyone gets as much as he needs. "" But these words have now become hard to live by. Many residents of working age are employed by Be'eri's successful printing house, and other smaller kibbutz businesses. Profits are pooled and people receive housing and other amenities based on their individual circumstances. However, the decision of some people not to return to work has undermined this principle of communal labour and living. And if some residents decide they can never return to Be'eri that could, in turn, create fresh problems. Many have little experience of non-communal living and would struggle financially if they lived independently. The 7 October attack has also quietened calls for peace. The kibbutz used to have a fund to support Gazans. Some residents would also help arrange medical treatment for Gazans at Israeli hospitals, members say. Now, among some, strong views to the contrary are shared in person and on social media. ""They'll [Gazans] never accept our being here. It's either us or them,"" says Rami. Several people bring up the killing of resident Vivian Silver - one of Israel's best-known peace advocates, external. ""For now, people are very mad,"" Shir says. ""People still want to live in peace, but for now, I can't see any partner on the other side. ""I don't like to think in terms of hate and anger, it's not who I am, but I can't disconnect from what happened that day. ""Shir wears a necklace engraved with a portrait of her lifelong friend Carmel Gat, who was taken hostage from Be'eri that day. Her biggest dream was that they would be reunited - but, on 1 September, Carmel's body was found alongside five other hostages. The IDF said they had been killed by Hamas just hours before a planned rescue attempt. Hamas said the hostages were killed in air strikes - but an autopsy on the returned bodies concluded they had all been shot multiple times at close range. Be'eri is still waiting and hoping for the return of others. So far, 18 have been brought back alive, along with two dead bodies, while 10 are still in Gaza, at least three of whom are believed to still be alive. Behind Dafna's father's house, 37-year-old Yuval Haran stands in front of the home where his father was killed, and many relatives were taken hostage, on 7 October. His brother-in-law Tal is still being held in Gaza. ""Until he comes back, my clock is still on 7 October. I don't want revenge, I just want my family back, I just want to have a quiet peaceful life again,"" Yuval says. In all, some 1,200 people were killed across southern Israel on 7 October, with 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Since then, in the Israeli military operation in Gaza, more than 41,000 people have been killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people - combatants and civilians - have also been killed in Lebanon in Israeli air strikes against the armed group Hezbollah, in a significant escalation of their long-running conflict. Residents from Be'eri say that before 7 October, despite their proximity to the Gaza fence, they always felt safe - such was their faith in the Israeli military system. But that faith has now been shaken. ""I'm less confident and I'm less trusting,"" Shir says. She relives the events in her dreams. ""I wake up and I remind myself it's over. But the trauma is, I think, for life. I don't know if I can ever feel fully safe again. ""This summer Rami and Simon also took on the sombre task of digging graves for Be'eri's dead, who are only just being moved back to the kibbutz from cemeteries elsewhere in Israel. ""After the 7th [October] this area was a military zone, we couldn't bury them here,"" says Rami, as he looks over the graves, a rifle slung across his body. Simon says it brings up strong and passionate feelings - ""but in the end they're back at home"". Each time a person is returned, the kibbutz holds a second funeral, with many residents in attendance. Shir, in the temporary site at Hatzerim, says that for now, she is drawing strength from the community around her. ""We're not whole, but we will be I hope,"" she says. ""It's a grieving community - sadder and angrier - but still a strong community.

3110,2024-07-25 10:19:38.245000+00:00,/news/articles/c51y9qpjyx8o,"The Israeli military says it has recovered the bodies of five Israelis taken back to Gaza as hostages during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The bodies of kindergarten teacher Maya Goren as well as the soldiers Sergeant Major Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sergeant Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas and Sergeant Kiril Brodski were found in a Hamas tunnel in the southern city of Khan Younis on Wednesday. The military said the tunnel was underneath an area it had previously designated as a humanitarian zone. It also said it had determined that Ms Goren was murdered in captivity, while the soldiers were killed in combat on 7 October and their bodies then abducted. The announcement means 111 of the 251 people taken hostage are still being held in Gaza, including 39 who the military says are presumed dead. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred frequently to the fate of the remaining hostages in his address to the US Congress, but he gave no clue as to whether a deal with Hamas to secure their release in return for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange was close. “As we speak, we’re actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release,” he said. His failure to give more hope to the families and friends of the missing did not go unnoticed. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called the speech “a sham”, adding that Mr Netanyahu “spoke for an hour without saying: ‘There will be a hostage deal. ’”Hostages’ relatives who watched the speech on screens set up in what is known as Hostages Square in central Tel Aviv also reacted with anger and dismay. Talya Dancyg, a granddaughter of Alex Dancyg, whose death in captivity was confirmed on Monday, cried: “My grandfather could still be alive with us, he was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting, he was waiting for you to seal the deal!”“Do you realise that you are becoming an accomplice to murder?” shouted Nissan Kalderon, brother of hostage Ofer Kalderon. “You are killing our families, give up your political ambitions. ” Shortly afterwards, the kibbutzim of Nir Oz and Nir Yitzhak announced in separate statements that they had been informed of the recovery of Ms Goren and Sgt Goldin's bodies. On Thursday, a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency, also known as the Shin Bet, confirmed that commandos had recovered their bodies, along with those of Sgt Katz, Sgt Ahimas and Sgt Brodski, during an operation in the Khan Younis area. “The IDF and ISA will continue to operate, using all intelligence and operational means to fulfil the supreme mission of rescuing all of the hostages,” it added. On Thursday afternoon, the IDF revealed that the hostages’ bodies had been held underneath an area that it had previously designated as a humanitarian zone for Palestinian civilians. “The forces located an underground tunnel shaft, leading to a tunnel approximately 200m in length and 20m deep with several rooms where the hostages were located,” it said. “This is a further example of how Hamas cynically exploited the humanitarian area and used it to hold captive Israelis killed and abducted on 7 October. ”On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of eastern neighbourhoods of Khan Younis, saying there had been “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” from them, and told residents to head to the “adjusted” al-Mawasi humanitarian area. The UN estimated that more than 150,000 people had fled the Khan Younis area by Tuesday evening, while the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 80 people had been killed in Israeli air and artillery strikes. At least another six people were reportedly killed on Wednesday. The IDF said its troops were continuing operations against “terrorist infrastructure and operatives” in Khan Younis on Thursday and claimed that they had killed dozens of Palestinian fighters over the past few days. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum praised the recovery of the hostages' bodies as a “crucial and decisive military action that provides their families with important closure and eternal rest for the murdered”. “It is Israel's duty to return all the murdered for honourable burial and all living hostages for rehabilitation. The immediate return of the remaining 115 hostages can only be achieved through a deal!” it said, including among their number another four Israelis who were abducted before 7 October. The forum called on Mr Netanyahu to send Israel’s negotiating team to Qatar “without delay”. The Israeli prime minister’s office had said the negotiators would depart on Thursday, following what it called an in-depth discussion with Mr Netanyahu over the weekend. But on Wednesday, Israeli officials said the team would head to Doha only after Mr Netanyahu had met US President Joe Biden at the White House. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.",Israeli military recovers five hostages' bodies in Gaza,Israeli military recovers five hostages' bodies in Gaza,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c51y9qpjyx8o,articles/article_3110.txt,results/article_3110.txt.json
3112,2024-08-13 18:34:05.877000+00:00,/news/articles/cg58yj57jdeo,"A far-right Israeli minister has led hundreds of Jewish Israelis into Jerusalem’s most contested holy site, with many defying the Israeli government’s long-standing ban on Jewish prayer there. The visit by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, has been condemned as provocative by Palestinian leaders, as well as the US, France, the UN and several Arab states. Mr Ben-Gvir said in a video that “our policy is to enable Jewish prayer”. But the Israeli prime minister’s office insisted there had been no change to the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there. The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Situated in occupied East Jerusalem, it was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access. Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police. Videos shared on social media on Tuesday showed groups of Jewish Israelis singing the Israeli national anthem, some carrying the Israeli flag while others prostrate themselves in prayer at the edge of the holy site. Visiting the compound escorted by Israeli police, Itamar Ben Gvir, said “great progress” had been made in Israel’s “governance and sovereignty” there. “Our policy is to enable Jewish prayer,” he went on. He also declared that Israel “must win the war” in the Gaza Strip, and should not get involved in the talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to “bring Hamas to its knees”. Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the incident had “deviated from the status quo. ”“Israel's policy on the Temple Mount has not changed; this is how it has been and this is how it will be,” it stressed. In response to the statement, Mr Ben-Gvir said that it was his own policy to “enable freedom of worship for Jews in all places”. “There is no law that permits engaging in racist discrimination against Jews at the Temple Mount or anywhere else in Israel,” he added. However, the Palestinian foreign ministry expressed great concern about what it called “the dangerous escalation resulting from the raids by extremist settlers on the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque”. “The ministry will continue its political efforts to address these provocations at various levels, warning of their serious consequences on the conflict arena and the region as a whole,” a statement said. The Jordanian Islamic endowment which administers the site, the Waqf, said more than 2,000 Israelis had entered the compound and appealed to Muslims across the world to help it maintain the status quo. Jordan’s foreign ministry said the incident reflected “the insistence of the Israeli government and its extremist members to flout international laws and Israel’s obligations as the occupying power”. Egypt and Saudi Arabia also said the incident violated international law, with the former adding that Mr Ben-Gvir was seeking to scupper attempts to broker a Gaza ceasefire deal. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Ben-Gvir's visit ""demonstrated blatant disregard for the historic status quo with respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem. ""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" the US's top diplomat added. The French foreign ministry condemned Mr Ben-Gvir's visit, saying: ""This new provocation is unacceptable"". UN spokesperson Farhan Haq called the incident “unhelpful and unduly provocative”, adding: ""We are against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites. ”",Israeli minister denounced over call for Jewish prayer at Jerusalem holy site,Israeli minister denounced over call for Jewish prayer at Jerusalem holy site,"israel,palestinian_territories",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg58yj57jdeo,articles/article_3112.txt,results/article_3112.txt.json
3113,2024-07-29 09:12:16.618000+00:00,/news/articles/cw5y49rv174o,"Israel's security cabinet has authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister to decide when and how to retaliate for a deadly rocket attack Israel and the US say was carried out by the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah. Ministers met in emergency session in the wake of the strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday evening, which killed 12 children and teenagers from the Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. It was the deadliest cross-border incident in months of exchanges of fire between the two sides. The attack has heightened fears that what has been relatively contained hostilities so far could spiral into all-out war.  Western governments are urging Israel to show restraint in its response. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Israel had a right to respond to Hezbollah after Saturday's strike, but emphasised that nobody ""wants a broader war"". Mr Netanyahu, who cut short a visit to the US following the strike, went to the scene of the attack in the Druze town of Majdal Shams on Monday afternoon. ""These children are our children,"" he said. ""The state of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe. ""Scores of local residents protested against the prime minister's visit to the town, an AFP reporter there said. There has been anger against the authorities for not having prevented the strike. The White House said it had been in ""continuous discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since the horrific attack"" on the playing field in Majdal Shams. It said it was ""also working on a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line [the unofficial frontier between Israel and Lebanon] that will end all attacks once and for all"". On Monday morning an Israeli drone strike outside the Lebanese town of Shaqra, about 6.5km (four miles) from the Israeli border, killed two people, Lebanon's state media said. Hezbollah announced that the dead men were two of its fighters. Israel has not commented on the report.  Meanwhile Air France has become the latest airline to suspend flights to and from Beirut, as anticipation of Israeli retaliation grows. Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines, and Eurowings have similarly suspended flights. In Majdal Shams, the funerals of the young victims took place on Sunday amid scenes of raw grief. Thousands of people were gathered as the caskets, draped in white, were carried through the town. The attack is the most devastating to hit the Druze community, which has lived on the Golan Heights for centuries. They are part of an Arabic-speaking ethnic and religious group based in Lebanon, Syria, the Golan Heights and northern Israel. Those on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights have been under Israeli governance since Israel captured the area from Syria in the 1967 war, although many have retained their allegiance to Syria. There are about 21,000 who live on the rocky plateau, about 20% of whom have accepted Israeli citizenship. The attack on Majdal Shams has caused outrage across Israel and the Druze community, about 110,000 of whom also live in Israel. On his return from the US on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu held meetings with defence officials before convening the security cabinet. After the hours-long meeting, the prime minister's office issued a brief statement, saying only that the ""members of the Cabinet authorised the prime minister and the defence minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation"". In a condolence call earlier to the spiritual leader of Israel’s Druze community, Sheikh Muafak Ṭarif, Mr Netanyahu said Hezbollah would ""pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid to this point"". Hezbollah has strongly denied it was behind the attack, reportedly blaming the bloodshed on a failed Israeli interceptor missile. In a statement on Sunday, the Israeli military Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) knew ""exactly where the rocket was launched from"". Gen Halevi identified it as an Iranian made unguided surface-to-surface Falaq rocket with a 53kg warhead. ""This is a Hezbollah rocket.

Israeli far-right protesters broke into an army base in a show of support for soldiers accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian prisoner there. Large crowds gathered outside the Sde Teiman compound after Israeli military police entered it to detain the reservists, who are now subject to an official investigation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement strongly condemning the incident and calling for “an immediate calming of passions”. Protesters also broke into a second military base, where the reservists were taken for questioning, but a police spokeswoman said officers were able to clear it. Sde Teiman, near Beersheba in southern Israel, has for months been at the centre of reports of serious abuses against Gazan detainees. According to local media reports, at least nine Israeli soldiers at the base are accused of abusing the Palestinian detainee, a suspected Hamas fighter who was captured in Gaza. He is said to have been hospitalised after what Israeli media reports describe as serious sexual abuse and injuries to his anus that left him unable to walk. The Israeli military said its advocate general had ordered an inquiry “following suspected substantial abuse of a detainee”. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority's (PA) Commission of Detainees Affairs called on the international community to urgently intervene by carrying out an UN-mandated investigation. Gazans ‘shackled and blindfolded’ at Israel hospitalOn Monday dozens of protesters, including far-right MPs from Israel's governing coalition, burst through the base's gate as others tried to scale the fence, chanting “we will not abandon our friends, certainly not for terrorists”. Some soldiers at the base reportedly used pepper spray against the military police personnel who arrived to detain the reservists. Israeli military Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the break-in at Sde Tieman was ""extremely serious and against the law"". ""We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state,"" he said. ""I strongly condemn the incident, and we are working to restore order at the base. "" Demonstrators also entered the Beit Lid military base in central Israel where the accused reservists were taken for questioning. Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the investigation into the soldiers’ conduct must be allowed to continue, adding “even in times of anger, the law applies to everyone”. However some Israeli politicians have condemned the arrest of the reservists. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, called their detention “nothing less than shameful”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, Israeli authorities have rounded up and held thousands of Palestinians, often without legal representation. The BBC has previously spoken to medical workers at a field hospital set up in Sde Teiman, who alleged that detainees have been blindfolded, permanently shackled to their beds, and made to wear nappies rather than having access to a toilet. Last month, Israel’s Haaretz newspaper published allegations made by a doctor at Sde Teiman that leg amputations had been carried out on two prisoners, because of cuffing injuries. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Detainees there have told journalists and United Nations officials that they were beaten and attacked. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have denied systematic abuse. Many Gazans detained by Israel’s army are released without charge after interrogation. Amnesty International this month called on Israel to end the indefinite detention of Gaza Palestinians and what it called ""rampant torture"" in its prisons.",Israeli protesters enter army base after soldiers held over Gaza detainee abuse,Israeli protesters enter army base after soldiers held over Gaza detainee abuse,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2q07kd3ld6o,articles/article_3114.txt,results/article_3114.txt.json
3115,2024-08-27 13:51:23.803000+00:00,/news/articles/c624qr3mqrzo,"In the Palestinian village of Battir, where ancient terraces are irrigated by a natural spring, life carries on as it has for centuries. Part of a Unesco World Heritage site, Battir is known for its olive groves and vineyards. But now it is the latest flashpoint over settlements in the occupied West Bank. Israel has approved a new Jewish settlement here, taking away privately owned land for new settler houses and new outposts have been set up without even Israeli authorisation. “They are stealing our land to build their dreams on our catastrophe,” says Ghassan Olyan, whose property is among that seized. Unesco says it is concerned by the settlers’ plans around Battir, but the village is far from an isolated example. All settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees. “They are not caring about the international law, or local law, and even God’s law,” Mr Olyan says. Last week, Israel’s domestic intelligence chief Ronen Bar wrote to ministers warning that Jewish extremists in the West Bank were carrying out acts of “terror” against Palestinians and causing “indescribable damage” to the country. Since the start of the war in Gaza, there has been an acceleration in settlement growth in the occupied West Bank. Extremists in Israel’s government boast that these changes will prevent an independent Palestinian state from ever being created. There are fears, too, that they seek to prolong the war in Gaza to suit their goals. Yonatan Mizrahi from Peace Now, an Israeli organisation that monitors settlement growth, believes a “mix of rage and fear” in Israeli society after the 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, is driving settlers to seize more land, with fewer people questioning them. A June survey , externalby the Pew Research Center suggested that 40% of Israelis believed settlements made the country safer, up from 27% in 2013. Meanwhile, 35% of people polled said that the settlements hurt Israel’s security, down from 42%. Mr Mizrahi worries that Jewish extremists in the West Bank are exacerbating an already tense and volatile situation, making it harder than ever to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict. “I think it’s extremely dangerous,” he says. “It’s increasing the hate on both sides. ”Since the outbreak of the war, settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank has surged. It had already been on the rise, but in the past 10 months the UN has documented, external around 1,270 attacks, compared with, external 856 in all of 2022. According to the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, during the same period Israeli settler harassment has forced Palestinians out of at least 18 villages, external in the West Bank, the Palestinian territory between Israel and Jordan that was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and has been occupied ever since. Between 7 October and August 2024, 589 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank – at least 570 by Israeli forces and at least 11 by settlers, according to the UN, external. They include some said to have been planning attacks as well as unarmed civilians. In the same period, Palestinians killed five settlers and nine members of Israel’s security forces. This week, a Palestinian man aged 40 was reportedly shot dead after settlers and Israeli soldiers entered Wadi al-Rahhel, near Bethlehem. The Israeli military said stones had previously been thrown at an Israeli vehicle nearby. Last month, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was killed when dozens of settlers rampaged through the village of Jit, prompting international condemnation. Israeli security forces have made four arrests and have described the incident as a “severe terror event”. But the track record in such cases is one of virtual impunity. Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din found that, external, between 2005 and 2023, just 3% of official investigations into settler violence ended in a conviction. In the letter by Ronen Bar, which was leaked to Israeli media, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service said that radical settlers were emboldened by light-handed law enforcement. Settlers live in exclusively Jewish communities set up in parts of the West Bank. Many settlements have the legal support of the Israeli government; others, known as outposts, and often as simple as caravans and corrugated iron sheds, are illegal even under Israeli law. But extremists build them regardless in a bid to seize more land. In July, when the UN’s top court found for the first time that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was illegal, it said the country should halt all settlement activity and withdraw as soon as possible. Israel’s Western allies have repeatedly described settlements as an obstacle to peace. Israel rejected the finding, saying: “The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land. ” Now there are fears that extremists are working to make settlements in the West Bank irreversible. They have rapidly expanded their control over the territory, with the support of the most far-right government in Israel’s history. These extremists are advancing annexation plans in the West Bank and also openly call for settling Gaza once the war is over. Settlers now serve at the heart of Israel’s government, in key ministries. At the very time that world leaders opposed to settlements are voicing renewed enthusiasm for a two-state solution - a long-hoped for peace plan that would create a separate Palestinian state - Israeli religious nationalists, who believe all these lands rightfully belong to Israel, are vowing to make the dream of an independent Palestinian state impossible. Analysts think this is why some politicians are refusing to accept any ceasefire deal. “The reason they don’t want to end the conflict or go into a hostage deal is because they believe that Israel should keep on fighting until it can reach a point where it can stay inside Gaza,” says Tal Schneider, political correspondent for The Times of Israel. “They think for the long term their ideology is more righteous,” she adds. “This is their own logic. ”Israeli authorities, meanwhile, have announced plans for five new settlements, external, including the one in Battir, and declared a record area of land, at least 23 sq km, external, for the state. This means Israel considers it Israeli land, regardless of whether it is in the occupied Palestinian territories, or privately owned by Palestinians, or both, and Palestinians are prevented from using it. By changing facts on the ground, as the settlers describe it, they hope to move enough Israelis on to the land and build enough on it to make their presence irreversible. Their long-term hope is that Israel formally annexes the land. Outside state-sanctioned land seizures, extremists have also rapidly established settlement outposts. In one by al-Qanoub, north of Hebron, satellite images showed new caravans and roads had appeared in the months since the start of the war. Meanwhile, an entire Palestinian community has been forced off the land. We drove to al-Qanoub with Ibrahim Shalalda, 50, and his 80-year-old uncle Mohammed, who told us their homes had been destroyed by settlers last November. As we approached, an extremist settler blocked the road with his car. Armed Israelis soon arrived. The group – some Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, with insignia on their uniforms and one identified as a settlement security officer – stopped us for checks. The settlement guard forced the two Palestinian farmers from the car and searched them. After two hours, the IDF soldiers dispersed the settlers and allowed the BBC car to leave. Israel began settling the West Bank soon after capturing it from Jordan and occupying it more than five decades ago. Successive governments since then have allowed creeping settlement expansion. Today, an estimated three million Palestinians live on the land - excluding Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem - alongside about half a million Jewish Israelis, external in more than 130 settlements. But a prominent far-right government figure who took office in 2022 is promising to double the number of settlers to a million. Bezalel Smotrich believes that Jews have a God-given right to these lands. He heads one of two far-right, pro-settler parties that veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought into his governing coalition after the 2022 elections returned him to power. Mr Smotrich serves as finance minister but also has a post in the defence ministry, which has allowed him to make sweeping changes to Israeli policies in the West Bank. He has massively invested state finances in settlements, including new roads and infrastructure. But he has also created a new bureaucracy, taking powers from the military, to fast-track settler construction. In secretly recorded remarks, external to supporters, Mr Smotrich boasted that he was working towards “changing the DNA” of the system and for de facto annexation that would be “easier to swallow in the international and legal context”. Religious nationalists have sat on the fringes of Israeli politics for decades. But their ideology has slowly become more popular. In the 2022 election, these parties took 13 seats in the 120-seat Israeli parliament and became kingmakers in Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition. During the war, Bezalel Smotrich and fellow radical Itamar Ben-Gvir, now Israel’s national security minister, have repeatedly made comments stoking social division and provoking Israel’s Western allies. After Israel’s military arrested reservists accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee, Mr Ben Gvir said it was “shameful” for Israel to arrest “our best heroes”. This month, Mr Smotrich suggested it might be “justified and moral” to starve Gazans. But it is in the West Bank and Gaza that the far right seeks to make permanent changes. “This is a group of Israelis who have been against any type of compromise with the Palestinians or Israel's other Arab neighbours,” says Anshel Pfeffer, a veteran Israeli journalist and correspondent for The Economist. And with the war in Gaza, the far right sees a fresh opportunity. Mr Smotrich has called for Palestinian residents to leave, making way for Israelis who could “make the desert bloom”. Although Mr Netanyahu has ruled out restoring Jewish settlements in Gaza, he remains beholden to far-right parties who threaten to collapse his coalition if he signs a “reckless” ceasefire deal to bring home Israeli hostages currently held by Hamas. The logic of the extremists may be one that only a minority of Israelis follow. But it is helping to prolong the war, and dramatically transforming the landscape of the West Bank - causing long-term damage to chances of peace.

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports. Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the school-turned-shelter was meant to be used to administer polio vaccines. Monday's rollout is the second stage in the UN's polio campaign in central Gaza, which is where most residents are now living and where the first case of polio in two decades was recently discovered in an unvaccinated baby. In a separate Israeli strike, four people were killed and dozens more injured at the al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. Israel said it carried out a ""precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command and control centre"" inside a site previously used as a hospital. The main areas of conflict in Gaza in recent days have been in the north, where Israeli forces have been intensifying attacks for over a week as part of a major ground operation. Hundreds have since been killed, Gazan authorities have reported. Residents of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Beit Lahiya have reported being cut off from nearby Gaza City, while Israeli tanks have been seen on the outskirts of the territory's largest city. Hospitals in the area are running out of supplies, although the World Health Organization said a joint operation with the Red Cross had resupplied two of them -after nine days of attempts.

Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys. One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand. According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people. Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side. An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a “safer area” because of the war. The IDF has not yet responded to questions about the incident. Over the last year of war, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported more than 42,000 people killed. In the past 24 hours, at least 62 people have died and 220 more injured following four Israeli strikes, it added. About 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war - many of whom have been forced to move multiple times to escape.

3119,2024-09-12 23:19:40.196000+00:00,/news/articles/c89w98xnjk2o,"Details are emerging of an apparent raid by Israeli special forces on a ""Hezbollah missile production facility"" in Syria. Israel's government has said nothing about the operation which, according to US media reports, took place at the beginning of the week. Syrian state media say 18 people were killed on Monday in the raid near the Syrian city of Masyaf - around 25 miles (40km) north of the Lebanese border - and several dozen were injured. According to the New York Times, external, Israeli special forces descended from helicopters, placed explosives inside the Iranian-built facility and removed sensitive information. American and other officials quoted in the paper paint a picture of a daring operation, designed to destroy the underground military facility. Air strikes were apparently used to neutralise Syria’s defences and prevent reinforcements from reaching the site. Separately, a report by the Axios news site, external - citing three sources said to be familiar with the operation - says the elite Shaldag unit of the Israeli Air Force carried out the raid. Axios also reports that Israel informed the US before the operation was slated to take place, and was not met with any resistance from the White House. The BBC has not yet been able to independently verify these reports. Israel's government has not commented, but the raid seems to have been designed to prevent Iran from supplying precision missiles to Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally and proxy. Israel attacked the facility six years ago and has mounted dozens of air strikes against Syria since the war in Gaza began almost a year ago. But, putting Israeli troops on the ground inside Syria is highly unusual. This would be one of the most sophisticated operations of its kind in years. Last Sunday, at least 18 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on a number of military sites in the vicinity of Masyaf, according to the Syrian health minister. Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground - Israeli air and artillery strikes have targeted Syrian territory on more than 60 occasions since the start of the year. This has resulted in damage to or destruction of about 140 targets, including weapons depots, vehicles and Iran-backed militia headquarters, the SOHR said. The strikes have killed at least 208 fighters - including 46 members of Syrian government forces, 43 members of Hezbollah and 24 Iranian Revolutionary Guards - as well as 22 civilians, the monitoring group added.",Israeli special forces 'raid missile site in Syria',Israeli special forces 'raid missile site in Syria',"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89w98xnjk2o,articles/article_3119.txt,results/article_3119.txt.json
3120,2024-10-04 11:56:07.192000+00:00,/news/articles/cx20d0r8rvro,"An Israeli air strike has hit near the main border crossing point for people fleeing the escalating bombing and ground campaign in Lebanon for neighbouring Syria. Israel's military said it had hit Hezbollah targets near the Masnaa crossing, and earlier claimed the group was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon. The strike on Friday destroyed a section of the road and effectively cut off vehicle access. People are still able to make the journey on foot, with pictures showing families clambering over rubble and scrambling through the four-metre crater in the road to get out of the country. More than 300,000 people have left Lebanon for Syria in the past 10 days to flee the bombing, according to Lebanese government figures. The strike on Friday hit the road 700m from the checkpoint on the Lebanese side, and around 5km (3.1 miles) from the border itself. Aid workers said the destruction of the road near Masnaa crossing hinders both the movement of people and also food and humanitarian supplies. BBC Verify: A closer look at the crater damage near Syria’s border crossing""It will mean that goods which would normally come overland through that crossing - the cheapest, most effective way to bring commodities into that country -  will also not be able to be received here,"" Matthew Hollingworth, the director of the UN's World Food programme, told the BBC. Mr Hollingworth stressed that it was essential for other routes leading out of Lebanon - particularly those in the north - to remain unhindered. ""We really would press that they remain open because they will be critical for people to leave, and also for humanitarian commodities to come in,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Masnaa crossing in Lebanon's east had been the main path for people to move into Syria, and then onto Jordan and the Gulf States, while in Lebanon the road had also connected west to the capital Beirut on the coast, which has been heavily bombed in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Friday said it had targeted a site at the border crossing where ""weapons were transferred to Hezbollah"", and also a 3.5km underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria, the location of which was not specified. In a statement issued before the strike, the IDF said the crossing had become the ""primary border crossing for Hezbollah's weapons transfers"" and accused the group of concealing ""smuggling activity among civilian trucks and vehicles"". It called on Lebanon to thoroughly inspect trucks. Many people moving east are Syrian nationals living in Lebanon, who have headed back to their own country to escape Israel's bombardments. The BBC spoke to one woman in Beirut, who had sent her son back to Syria this week because the capital was too dangerous. ""I found a lot of people from our neighbourhood heading for Syria, so I sent him with them,"" she said. Syria's government said on Sunday that for the next week people crossing the border would no longer have to pay $100 to enter the country. On Friday, strikes also hit near Lebanon's only commercial airport, the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. The airport borders the suburb of Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city, and a continued target of Israeli air strikes. Major strikes there one week ago killed the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicated that the new strikes on Friday morning were aimed at the group's new leadership, including a potential new overall leader, Hashem Safieddine. Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks on Thursday while 151 others had been wounded. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli air strikes since fighting began in October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry says. Israeli forces on Friday also told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the South, including the regional capital city of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their safety. The new order applies to communities further inland, north of the Litani river, about 30km from the border with Israel. The river is a crucial marker as Israel has previously demanded that Hezbollah withdraw to the Litani, as per the UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.

3121,2024-09-10 01:25:23.945000+00:00,/news/articles/cwyx9znxl4eo,"At least 19 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike in the designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Witnesses said the strike obliterated an area crowded with tents for displaced Palestinians in al-Mawasi, south-west of Khan Younis, leaving huge craters in the sand. “The bombing was incredibly intense. People were thrown into the air,” one displaced man told the BBC. “You can’t imagine the devastation. ”The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked what it called “a number of senior Hamas terrorists” operating there - a claim Hamas denied. The military also disputed the initial death toll put out by the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority, which reported that rescue teams had recovered more than 40 bodies. Hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter in the humanitarian zone - which spans only about 41 sq km (16 sq miles) along Gaza's southern Mediterranean coast - after being told by the Israeli military to evacuate there for their own safety over the past 11 months. Living conditions inside the area are dire. The UN says it lacks critical infrastructure and basic services, while aid provision is limited due to access and security issues. Eyewitnesses said large explosions rocked al-Mawasi shortly after midnight local time on Tuesday (21:00 GMT on Monday). Khaled Mahmoud, a volunteer for a charity who lives near the site of the strike, told the BBC that he had been stunned by the scale of the destruction. ""The strikes created three craters 7m [23ft] deep and buried more than 20 tents,"" he said. Aya Madi, a displaced mother of seven from the southern city of Rafah, told a freelance journalist working for the BBC: “We woke up to nothing but sand and fire. ""My children were screaming, and the tent collapsed on them. I pulled them out from under the rubble. “I held my two-month-old son, thinking he was dead, covered in sand, barely breathing. I washed him and thanked God he was still alive. ”She said all of those killed were civilians, adding that there was “not a single resistance fighter”. “All that remains is dust and ashes,” she added. “Some of [the casualties] were torn in parts, other they had to dig to find, some were found in people’s houses. . . The scene is terrifying. ”Saib, a 12-year-old boy from Bani Suheila, told BBC Arabic that ""the screams of people filled the place"" after the explosions stopped. “I rushed with my father to help the people and put out the fire. We put out the fire with sand and then we entered the tents where we found burned children and people torn to pieces,” he said. “This is the first time since the war began that I have seen such horrific scenes. ”Another woman, Aisha Nafi al-Shaeri, said: ""It was all tents of displaced people. And now everything is destroyed. ""“They told people to stay here, but there is no safe area,"" she added. ""They didn’t warn anyone. Everyone was sleeping, and suddenly they started shelling. ” The Civil Defence’s operations director said overnight that more than 40 people were killed and more than 60 others were injured. Later on Monday, the nearby Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said 13 people killed in the strike had been brought there. An emergency physician at the hospital, Dr Mohammed al-Qudra, told BBC Arabic that it was also treating 60 injured people, 40 of whom were in a critical condition. ""Most of the injuries that arrived at the hospital were third-degree burns and amputations,"" he said. He also warned that the hospital lacked medical equipment and supplies to treat them, and that there was even a shortage of sheets for their beds. In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that hospitals had received a total of 19 bodies and more than 60 wounded people, some of whom were in a serious condition. It did not say how many were men, women or children. Rescuers were unable to reach a number of other victims still buried under sand and rubble, or on roads, the ministry added. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted “a precise strike on a number of senior Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area”. They included Samer Abu Daqqa, head of Hamas’s aerial unit, and Osama Tabesh, head of the observation and targets department in Hamas's military intelligence headquarters, it added. “Prior to the strike, extensive intelligence gathering was conducted, as well as continuous aerial surveillance in the hours leading up to the strike, which confirmed the presence of the terrorists in the area alongside additional terrorist operatives,” it said, adding that casualty numbers put out by Hamas-run authorities did “not align"" with its information. The IDF accused Hamas of embedding its operatives and military infrastructure in the humanitarian zone and using civilians as human shields. A Hamas statement denounced the strike on al-Mawasi as a “heinous massacre” and rejected the IDF’s claim that it had a command centre there. ""This is a clear lie that aims to justify these ugly crimes. The resistance has denied several times that any of its members exist within civilian gatherings or use these places for military purposes,” it said. UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland condemned the strike on a densely-populated area where displaced people were sheltering. “I underline that international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack, must be upheld at all times,” he said. “I also emphasize that civilians must never be used as human shields. ”He also urged Israel and Hamas to immediately agree a deal that would for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. An estimated 1.9 million people - more than 80% of the population - are estimated to have been displaced by the war, and some have had to flee as many as 10 times. UN agencies and their partners are currently trying to stop the spread of polio in the overcrowded camps with poor sanitation where many of them are living. The World Health Organization said the third phase of its vaccination campaign began in northern Gaza on Tuesday, after 446,000 children were inoculated in the centre and south earlier this month during localised pauses in the fighting agreed by Israel and Hamas. On Monday, a team of 12 UN staff members on their way to the north to support the campaign was stopped by Israeli troops at a checkpoint for more than seven hours, according to UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator Muhannad Hadi. “While at the checkpoint the team was informed that the IDF wanted to hold two of the UN staff members in the convoy for further questioning,” he said. ""The situation escalated quickly, with soldiers pointing their weapons directly towards the convoy personnel. Live shots were fired, and tanks and bulldozers approached, engaged with, and damaged UN vehicles, endangering the lives of UN staff inside the vehicles. ""The two staff were eventually questioned and then released following the intervention of senior UN officials to de-escalate the situation, he added. The IDF said its forces had intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy, and that they delayed the convoy in order to question them.

3122,2024-08-10 04:41:38.034000+00:00,/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no,"An Israeli air strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City has killed more than 70 people, the director of a hospital has told the BBC. Fadl Naeem, head of al-Ahli Hospital where many of the casualties were taken, said those were the victims who had been identified so far, with the remains of many others so badly disfigured that identification was difficult. An Israeli military spokesman said al-Taba’een school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denies. The strike has been criticised by Western powers, as well as regional countries which have said it shows Israel has no desire to reach a ceasefire or end the Gaza war.  Israel has attacked several such shelters in Gaza in the past few weeks. According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 school buildings in Gaza had been directly hit or damaged as of 6 July, with more than a dozen targeted since. Al-Taba’een school housed more 1,000 people - having recently received dozens of displaced people from the town of Beit Hanoun, after the Israeli army ordered them to leave their homes. The building also served as a mosque and the Israeli strike hit during dawn prayers, witnesses said. Jaafar Taha, a student who lives near the school, told the BBC the sound of the bombing was followed by screaming and noise. ""'Save us, save us,' they were screaming,"" he said. ""The scene was horrific. There were body parts everywhere and blood covering the walls. ""Salim Oweis, spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC the attack was ""really outrageous"". ""All those schools are really packed with civilians, children, mothers and families, who are taking refuge in any empty space whether it's a school or it's a mosque, whatever it is, even in hospital yards. ""  Israel accepts proposal to attend ‘urgent’ new ceasefire talksHistory of the Israel Gaza conflict explainedHamas: Who are the group's most prominent leaders? Israel's military said it had ""precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the al-Taba'een school"". A statement by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency said ""at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists"" were ""eliminated"" in the attack. An earlier statement by the IDF said ""approximately 20 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants"" had been ""operating"" at the compound. Earlier estimates of the number of dead were also in the dozens, with the Hamas-run health ministry's ambulance service saying more than 60 had been killed, according to AP. The civil defence agency put the number at more than 90. The BBC cannot independently verify figures from either side. The Israeli spokesman said the casualty figures released by Hamas officials ""do not align with the information held by the IDF, the precise munitions used, and the accuracy of the strike"". Hamas described the attack as a ""horrific crime and a dangerous escalation"" in Israel's ""war of extermination against the Palestinian people"". Fatah, Hamas's political Palestinian rival in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Israel's aim was ""to exterminate Palestinians through a policy of cumulative killing"". The US said it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of civilian casualties and was seeking further details. A US National Security Council spokesman said: ""We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of. ""But we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimise civilian harm. ""He said ""far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded"", adding that it ""underscores the urgency of a ceasefire and hostage deal"". Philippe Lazzarini, head of Unrwa, the UN agency which helps Palestinians, said: ""It’s time for these horrors unfolding under our watch to end. ""The French foreign ministry said it condemned the strike ""in the firmest of terms"". ""For several weeks, school buildings have been repeatedly targeted, with an intolerable number of civilian victims,"" it said. ""Israel must respect international humanitarian law,"" it added. The UK's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said he was ""appalled"" by the ""tragic loss of life"" and stressed the need for ""an immediate ceasefire"". This strike has again drawn graphic attention to a controversial dynamic of the Gaza war. Israel claims that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to plan and carry out attacks, and that is why it has been targeting hospitals and schools - sites protected under international law. Hamas has consistently denied the accusations. Whatever the case, these are both locations where Gazans displaced by the conflict have sought shelter – especially in schools, more than 80% of which have been directly hit or damaged. Since early July, Israel has struck at least 13 of them - including four in a four-day period - each time declaring that they take steps to decrease the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions. Many of the schools were run by the UN before the war, and the UN has strongly condemned the strikes. This seems a particularly deadly incident. No doubt it will increase pressure for a ceasefire, but the reaction of regional mediators suggests concern that it could further set back struggling efforts to achieve one. Egypt, one of the mediators, said Israel’s “deliberate killing” of unarmed Palestinians showed that Israel lacked the political will to end the war. Qatar, also involved in ceasefire talks, demanded an urgent international investigation.  Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

3123,2024-08-17 15:40:26.846000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y364j3eryo,"An Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon has killed 10 people, Lebanese officials say, in one of the deadliest attacks in the current violence along the Lebanon-Israel border. The building hit, in the city of Nabatieh, was housing Syrian refugees, the Lebanese Health Minister, Firass Abiad, told the BBC. Israel said it had targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot, which was denied by the owner of the facility. In response Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political Lebanese group, fired a barrage of rockets, targeting a kibbutz in northern Israel and another on an Israeli military post. There were no casualties as a result of the first attack, while two Israeli soldiers were injured in the second, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Israel and Hezbollah have traded near daily fire across the border since the 7 October attack on Israel by Palestinian militants prompted an Israeli invasion of Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas. Tensions have escalated further in recent weeks after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, in Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has vowed to respond to the assassination. It comes as international mediators have urged Israel and Hamas to agree a ceasefire deal in upcoming talks, amid fears the war in Gaza could spiral into a regional conflict. Iran has dismissed calls from Western leaders to refrain from retaliating against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in its capital, Tehran, last month. But there are indications that Iran may have decided to delay its response amid the efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza. Mr Abiad, however, said Israel's actions suggested it had no interest in a deal. He also said that a woman and her two children were among the dead in Nabatieh, and that a further five people were in a critical condition. Hossain Tohmaz, the owner of one of the buildings hit, said it was a “100% civilian facility”, where people worked and lived. ""This is a hangar used for manufacturing iron, and that is a warehouse where we park trucks for loading goods like solar panels. The workers live and sleep on the top floor,"" he said. A few hours later, Hezbollah said it had fired Katyusha rockets at Ayelet HaShahar, a kibbutz north of the Sea of Galilee. The IDF said it had it had detected 55 launches from Lebanon, some of which had fallen in ""open areas"". ""Multiple fires were ignited in the area and Israel Fire and Rescue Services are currently operating at the scene to extinguish them,"" it wrote in an update on Telegram. A short while later, Hezbollah said it had attacked an Israeli military position in Marj. The IDF said one soldier had been severely injured and another lightly injured as a result of a projectile launched from Lebanon that had fallen on Misgav Am, which sits next to the Israel-Lebanon border. ""The soldiers were evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment and their families have been notified,"" it added. The strike is among the deadliest attacks in Lebanon in the current hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.

3124,2024-10-07 14:58:41.619000+00:00,/news/articles/cn9dz0p943zo,"At least 10 firefighters were killed in an Israeli air strike in a border area in southern Lebanon on Sunday night, the Lebanese health ministry says. The firefighters had been “ready to go out on rescue missions” from a municipal building in Baraachit when it was struck, a ministry statement on Monday. The Israeli military told the BBC on Tuesday that it had conducted a ""precise"" strike on ""several Hezbollah terrorist operatives who were using a fire station as a military post during combat"". The military also said it carried out air strikes on 120 Hezbollah targets across the south in only hour on Monday afternoon, after Lebanese media reported intense Israeli bombardment across the region. The state-run National News Agency said Israeli aircraft hit more than 30 towns and villages around the southern coastal city of Tyre alone. The BBC’s Orla Guerin, who is in Tyre, said some of the locations hit were in the hills close to the border with Israel, but that at least one struck a built-up area of the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets of the strikes belonged to three regional units of Hezbollah’s Southern Front - the elite Radwan Force, the Missiles and Rockets Force, and the Intelligence Directorate. The IDF also said it conducted a “targeted” strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where a thick plume of smoke was reported. The Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon also appeared to be expanding, with the IDF saying that a third division had joined the ground operation it launched six days ago to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure near the border. The IDF also ordered the evacuation of another 20 communities in the south, including the coastal town of Naqoura where the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon have their headquarters. Three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 1,400 people, including 22 on Sunday, and displaced another 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident. . . in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. It came hours after Hezbollah rockets struck the northern Israeli port city of Haifa and the town of Tiberias, causing damage and nine injuries. Another 135 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Monday, according to the IDF. Police said a road was damaged in the Lower Galilee region between Haifa and Tiberias. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that the “counterattack on our enemies in Iran's axis of evil is necessary for securing our future and ensuring our security”.","Israeli strike kills 10 firefighters in south Lebanon, authorities say","Israeli strike kills 10 firefighters in south Lebanon, authorities say",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn9dz0p943zo,articles/article_3124.txt,results/article_3124.txt.json

The Palestinian Authority-run news agency Wafa said the strike had hit a cafe in the Tulkarm refugee camp where many civilians were present. Hamas confirmed that commander Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi was killed by the strike, who the IDF say attempted a car bombing last month and supplied weapons. The Israeli military said the air strike was a joint operation with its Shin Bet security service, aimed at killing Oufi and ""other significant terrorists"". Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said on messaging app Telegram that seven of its fighters were killed in the attack on the cafe. There was a further spike in violence in the West Bank after Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza, in what was already the occupied territory's deadliest year on record. Since then, more than 700 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, according to the Palestinian health ministry, as Israeli forces have intensified their raids. The IDF has said it is trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. The Israeli military has carried out dozens of air strikes in the occupied West Bank in the past year, but normally using drones or helicopters.

Wafa quoted a local official as saying children and elderly people from several families had been killed in the strike. There were also a large number of injured. A local cafe owner and brother of one of those killed told Reuters news agency: ""We are used to missile sounds, drones and the explosive drones, but the sound was strong.

Two others were injured when a car was hit in Tubas early on Thursday. Israel's military said it had struck an “armed terrorist cell”, and armed groups claimed the dead as fighters. Palestinian media also said a 16-year-old boy had been shot dead by Israeli forces in nearby al-Faraa refugee camp. The military said forces had killed “a terrorist who was armed with an explosive device” in an exchange of fire, and that a strike targeted others. For nine days, Israeli forces have been raiding northern cities as part of what they say is a major counter-terrorism operation. So far, at least 36 Palestinians have been killed, including 21 from Jenin governorate, eight from Tubas, according to the health ministry. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says several children are also among them, including a 16-year-old girl who was shot in her home near Jenin on Tuesday. One Israeli soldier has been killed during the fighting in Jenin. A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers and Israel Prison Service forces began an operation in Tubas and al-Faraa camp on Wednesday night. It named one of the five men killed in the air strike in Tubas as Mohammed Zakaria Zubeidi, 21, and said he was “a significant terrorist from the Jenin area”. He was also the son of Zakaria Zubeidi, the imprisoned former commander in Jenin of the Fatah movement’s armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and alleged mastermind of a jailbreak in 2021. The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades confirmed in a statement that Mohammed Zubeidi and four other fighters were killed in what it called a “treacherous” Israeli strike. Palestinian news agency Wafa also cited Palestinian Red Crescent sources as saying on Thursday that its crews had transferred the body of 16-year-old boy, Majed Fida Abu Zeina, from al-Faraa camp to a hospital in Tubas, external. The sources said he was shot more than once by Israeli forces and that his body was dragged out of the camp by a military bulldozer. The IDF said one of its aircraft had “struck armed terrorists who hurled explosives and shot at the security forces” during the operation in al-Faraa camp. “In an exchange of fire, Israel Prison Service forces eliminated a terrorist who was armed with an explosive device,” it added. The IDF provided no further details about the incidents, but it did release night-time aerial surveillance footage that appeared to show an unidentified person throwing an object that explodes before a missile targets them. The Palestinian health ministry says three Palestinians have also been killed in the southern governorate of Hebron over the past nine days. The Israeli military said one of them carried out a shooting attack that killed three Israeli police officers near Tarqumiyah on Sunday. On Tuesday, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF must use its “full strength” to combat what he called “the resurgence of terrorism” in the West Bank. There has been a spike in violence in the territory since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza.

Women and children were among the dead brought to hospitals following the attack on al-Faluja school in the urban Jabalia refugee camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said a “precise"" strike targeted a “command-and-control centre” used by Hamas fighters. The armed group has previously denied operating inside schools. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said thousands of displaced Palestinians were living at al-Faluja school and put the death toll at 15. Local medics meanwhile told Reuters news agency that at least 14 people were killed. One resident, Rami Abdul Nabi, said the school was hit by two missiles and that it felt “like an earthquake” as they exploded. ""This should be. . . a place for the displaced to find a sanctuary, people who have no options left,” he told Reuters. “It was a shocking massacre. "" Many schools have been turned into shelters for the 1.9 million Palestinians who have fled their homes since the war between Israel and Hamas started almost a year ago. However, at least 61% of schools have been directly hit during the conflict and another 24% have been damaged, according to satellite analysis by the UN and its partners. Three other schools in northern and central Gaza were struck by Israeli aircraft between last Saturday and Monday, reportedly killing at least 32 people. As with Thursday’s strike in Jabalia camp, the Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas command centres and that it had taken steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. It also accused Hamas of systematically violating international law by operating from inside civilian infrastructure. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 41,150 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a rival of Hamas who is based in the occupied West Bank - appealed to world leaders to end the war. ""Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue,” he said. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemned the speech, saying that Abbas “did not say the word ‘Hamas’ once”. “Since the massacre of 7 October, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,” he added. The US, Egypt and Qatar are trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal, which they also see as key to de-escalating the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. However, US officials have admitted the negotiations have stalled in recent weeks.","Israeli strike on Gaza school kills at least 11, health ministry says","Israeli strike on Gaza school kills at least 11, health ministry says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgxqp81lxxo,articles/article_3128.txt,results/article_3128.txt.json

Videos from the scene at Rufaida al-Aslamia school in the town of Deir al-Balah show a cloud of smoke and dust rising up as people rush to help the injured. Witnesses said there were two air strikes that hit two rooms in the school where food aid was being stored and distributed. The Israeli military said the “precise strike” targeted Hamas fighters operating inside a ""command-and-control centre” at the school. It also said it had taken numerous steps to mitigate harm to the civilians living there. “This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organisation’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,” it added. Hamas has denied the allegation. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry also put the death toll at 28 and denounced what it called a “new massacre” by the Israeli military. A list published by al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah suggested that at least two of those killed were children, five were women and three were men in their 60s. Another person named on the list was Ahmed Adel Hamouda, 58, whose widow said he had worked in the school’s administration. “They killed my only support in life. They killed the support of our three disabled daughters, Rahab, Alaa and Reem,” she said. Eyewitness Khaled al-Sultan told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme that he saw “horrible things that are beyond description”. “We were not able to retrieve one complete body because all the victims' bodies turned into pieces. The number of martyrs is shocking,” he added. Another man, Taha Majad, asked: “Why would a shelter school like this be bombed by F-16 jets? We are humans, aren’t we?” Many schools have been turned into shelters for the 1.9 million Palestinians who have fled their homes since the war in Gaza started a year ago. Despite that, the UN says more than 200 schools have been hit, with at least 50 being completely destroyed. Rufaida school is located inside the Israeli-designated al-Mawasi “humanitarian area”, where the Israeli military has told Palestinians to flee despite it being overcrowded and lacking basic services. They include all of the estimated 400,000 people currently living in the north of Gaza, where Israeli forces are continuing a ground offensive on Jabalia and its urban refugee camp. Reuters news agency cited Palestinian health officials as saying that at least 130 people had been killed since Sunday, when the Israeli military announced it was launching an operation in response to intelligence that Hamas fighters were regrouping there. The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning its forces had killed “more than 50 terrorist operatives” and located large quantities of weapons in the Jabalia area over the previous 24 hours. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a Hamas ""command and control centre"" had been embedded inside the compound in Gaza City, which it targeted in a ""precise strike"" on 21 September. It killed 22 people, including 13 children and six women, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The school, closed during the war, had been housing displaced people, the health ministry said. One young girl, Amal, told the BBC she had been inside the school building when it was hit and saw bodies “torn apart”. “What have we done as children? We wake up and go to sleep terrified,"" she said. “At least protect the schools; we don’t have schools or homes - where do we go?”Sources have told the BBC that one of those killed was a local Hamas figure, meaning many civilians died due to a single main target. Huda Alhadad lost two children – son Muhammad, 13, and daughter Hanan, 12. “I was coming from the hallway when the missile fell. I came and found my husband screaming, saying, 'My children, my children, my children,'"" she told the BBC. “I asked him, 'Where are they?' I searched for them and found them under the rubble. ”In the twelve days after the air strike, at least eight more fatal strikes took place in Gaza on school buildings housing displaced families – the latest in a series of attacks on such buildings, which provide little safety. Unicef has said more than 50% of schools used as shelters in Gaza had been directly hit during the current war, with “devastating consequences for children and families”. In each of the latest strikes, the IDF released public statements saying the former schools had contained Hamas terrorists or “command and control” centres. In their public statement about the 21 September strike, the IDF incorrectly named the former school they hit – Al-Zeitoun C – instead identifying another one nearby, Al-Falah. We confirmed that Al-Zeitoun C was the one that had been hit by speaking to local people, as well as comparing videos of the attack aftermath with satellite imagery. The Hamas-run Gazan authorities also named it as Al-Zeitoun C. The relevant area is in the Al-Zeitoun neighbourhood and includes four distinct schools: Al-Falah, and Al-Zeitoun A, B, and C. When asked about incorrectly naming the school, the IDF refused to comment. It would also not comment on who was targeted. The Hamas-run government media office said the Israeli military had committed a “horrific massacre” by bombing Al-Zeitoun C school, which shelters displaced people. It said that, in addition to those killed, the attack also caused severe injuries, including nine children who needed limbs amputating. Dr Amjad Eliwa, an emergency physician who treated those injured in the strike, described over 30 injuries reaching his hospital, saying they were “mostly among children and women, with cases of amputations and very severe injuries”. He described one of those who died as a woman who was six months pregnant. This was corroborated by images of a foetus at the site of the strike, and residents said the dead woman was Barah Deraawi, who died along with two young daughters, Israa and Iman.

3131,2024-11-12 22:52:51.304000+00:00,/news/articles/c86q5qeqxldo,"At least 28 people were killed on Tuesday in Israeli air strikes on two houses in central Lebanon where displaced families were reportedly living, the Lebanese health ministry says. Twenty people, mostly women and children, were killed in Joun and eight others were killed near Baalchmay. Both villages are in the Mount Lebanon region and outside areas where the armed group Hezbollah has a strong presence. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah ""terror facilities"". Earlier, it hit what it said were a number of Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Meanwhile, two people were killed by Hezbollah rocket fire in the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. It came a day after Israel’s defence minister ruled out a ceasefire with Hezbollah until its war goals were met. The Israeli military went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Israel says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of northern Israeli border area residents displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 2,600 in the seven weeks since Israel launched an intense air campaign followed by a ground invasion in the south, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Another 1.2 million people have been displaced. On Tuesday morning, the Israeli military carried out at least 10 strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, after issuing evacuation orders for 11 locations. Lebanese media reported that several buildings were levelled, including a medical centre in the Bir al-Abed area, but there were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets, including command centres and weapons production sites. In the evening, the Israeli military declared that it had “dismantled a majority of Hezbollah’s weapons storage and missile manufacturing facilities” that had been “systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings” in Dahieh. Most residents of Dahieh - one of the areas where Hezbollah has a significant presence, along with southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley - have fled because their neighbourhoods have been targeted repeatedly since September. On Tuesday afternoon, 20 people were killed, including eight women and eight children, in an Israeli strike on a house in Joun, in the Chouf mountains near the southern coastal city of Sidon, the Lebanese health ministry said on Wednesday. The state-run National News Agency reported that displaced families had been staying there. Residents and a security official said another house where displaced families had taken refuge was hit in Baalchmay, 30km (20 miles) to the north-east, killing eight people and injuring five. Wael Murtada told the Associated Press, external that the home had belonged to his uncle and that those inside had fled from Dahieh about 40 days ago. He said at least three children were among the dead. The Israeli military said on Wednesday that the two strikes had hit a Hezbollah ""terror facility"" but gave no details. Elsewhere in Lebanon, five people were killed in a strike in the southern village of Teffahta, according to the health ministry. In the northern town of Ain Yaaqoub, Lebanon’s Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of 16 people, including four Syrian refugees, from the rubble of a residential building that was destroyed by an air strike on Monday night. The Israeli military said its forces had targeted a “military structure with a terrorist inside”. It also said Israeli soldiers were continuing ground operations in southern Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure, including rocket launchers. About 55 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israel on Tuesday, according to the Israeli military. One rocket hit a warehouse in Nahariya, killing two Israeli men in their 50s. ""There was a lot of destruction and an active fire,"" paramedic Dor Vakinin told AFP news agency. ""We performed medical examinations on two men who were lying unconscious. . . Unfortunately, their injuries were too severe and after the examinations we had to determine the death of both of them. ""Hezbollah said its fighters had fired a barrage of rockets at an Israeli military base north of the town of Acre, and that it had also targeted troops stationed in several Israeli border communities. A Hezbollah drone also hit the playground of a kindergarten in a suburb of the Israeli city of Haifa, but no-one was hurt. On Monday, new Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that he had told a forum of Israel generals that “there will be no ceasefire” until Hezbollah could no longer carry out such attacks. “We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel’s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own,” he added. Katz said the goals were “disarming Hezbollah and its withdrawal beyond the Litani river”, which runs about 30km north of the border with Israel, as well as “returning the residents of the north safely to their homes”. Earlier, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar had said there was “a certain progress” after being asked by journalists in Jerusalem about a possible ceasefire. Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif told a news conference in Beirut: “We hear a lot of talk, but so far, according to my information, nothing official has reached Lebanon or us in this regard. ”Lebanon’s government has called for a ceasefire based on the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. The resolution called for Lebanese territory south of the Litani to be free of any armed personnel or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state and a UN peacekeeping force. Israel has long complained that the resolution failed to prevent Hezbollah from building a formidable military presence in south and firing rockets over the border.","Israeli strikes in Mount Lebanon villages kill 28, ministry says","Israeli strikes in Mount Lebanon villages kill 28, ministry says",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86q5qeqxldo,articles/article_3131.txt,results/article_3131.txt.json
3132,2024-09-11 10:25:10.680000+00:00,/news/articles/cr5ng136518o,"Eight Palestinians have been killed in two Israeli air strikes in the north of the occupied West Bank, paramedics and health officials say. The first strike took place around dawn on Wednesday and killed five young men in Tubas, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it targeted an armed ""terrorist cell” during a counter-terrorism operation in the city. The IDF adds that it conducted a second strike in the evening during a separate operation in Tulkarm. The Red Crescent says three people were killed when a car was hit. Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was killed in what the IDF said was a ramming attack involving a fuel tanker elsewhere in the West Bank. The IDF said a ""terrorist driving a Palestinian truck” near the Jewish settlement of Givat Assaf “accelerated towards forces conducting operational activity”. Soldiers and an armed civilian then “neutralised” the driver at the scene, it added. Israeli media posted video footage showing a tanker veering off a busy road at high speed before hitting a bus stop. They also identified the driver as a Palestinian man from Rafat. Rafat’s council leader told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that he knew the driver and did not believe it was an attack, but rather a case of him losing control of the tanker. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 690 Palestinians have been killed, the Palestinian health ministry says, as Israeli forces have intensified their nearly daily search and arrest raids. Israel says it is trying to stem Palestinian attacks in the West Bank and Israel, in which at least 33 Israelis have been killed, according to Israeli authorities. The IDF said in a statement that its troops, along with forces from the Shin Bet internal security agency and Israel Prison Service, had been operating since Tuesday night to ""thwart terror"" in Tubas and Tamun. An air strike killed ""five terrorists armed with explosives who posed a threat to the forces, while the forces on the ground confiscated weapons, dismantled a vehicle rigged with explosives, and hit several armed fighters during exchanges of fire, it added"". A curfew in Tubas was also imposed on Tubas and that the city's government hospital was surrounded, with people allowed to exit and enter subject to being checked by Israeli forces, according to an Israeli military official. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Wednesday morning that Israeli forces were carrying out large-scale raids on the city’s outskirts and several neighbourhoods. It also said another Israeli military operation was continuing in the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camps for a second day. On Tuesday, the Palestinian health ministry said a Palestinian man and woman had been killed by gunfire from Israeli forces in Tulkarm. The IDF has not commented on that report, but the statement it put out on Wednesday afternoon said Israeli forces had ""eliminated an armed terrorist and struck several others"" during a counter-terrorism operation in the Tulkarm area. Later, the IDF put out a brief statement saying that an aircraft had conducted an air strike in Tulkarm, without providing any further details. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had taken the bodies of three Palestinians to a local hospital following a drone strike on a vehicle in a suburb of Tulkarm. Armed groups identified the dead men as fighters, according to Palestinian media reports. The raids come days after the largest Israeli operation in the West Bank since last October. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 36 Palestinians had been killed during the nine-day operation in the Tubas, Tulkarm and Jenin areas. Most of the dead were claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry said children were also among those killed. An Israeli soldier was also killed during the fighting in Jenin. In a separate development on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said Israel had to do more to make sure that incidents like the killing of an American-Turkish activist during a protest in the West Bank last week “never happen again”. The IDF said on Tuesday that it was ""highly likely"" Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was ""hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her"". Mr Biden said the US had confidence in the result of the Israeli investigation but described the killing as “totally unacceptable” and demanded full accountability. An Israeli government spokesman insisted the IDF’s rules of engagement were “extremely clear in preventing any damage to any harm to civilians”.","Israeli strikes in West Bank kill eight Palestinians, paramedics say","Israeli strikes in West Bank kill eight Palestinians, paramedics say","israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5ng136518o,articles/article_3132.txt,results/article_3132.txt.json
3133,2024-10-25 13:08:21.801000+00:00,/news/articles/cq8vx77yz34o,"At least 38 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Rescue workers said nine children from one family were among those killed on the outskirts of the southern city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military said its troops had killed numerous Hamas fighters and dismantled infrastructure during an operation in the Khan Younis area, and questioned the number of casualties reported. It came as Israeli forces reportedly raided one of the last functioning hospitals in the north of the territory. The WHO said it had lost contact with medics at Kamal Adwan hospital in the northern town of Beit Lahia, close to the besieged Jabalia area, while the health ministry said Israeli troops had detained staff, patients and displaced people there. The Israeli military said its forces were operating ""in the area” of Kamal Adwan based on intelligence “regarding the presence of terrorists”. Hundreds of Palestinians have reportedly been killed and tens of thousands displaced in recent weeks by a new Israeli ground offensive in Jabalia, which the military has said aims to stop Hamas fighters regrouping. At least two residential buildings in the south-eastern al-Manara neighbourhood of Khan Younis were hit by Israeli strikes around dawn on Friday, according to a spokesman for Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. Fourteen people, including nine children, were killed when the home of the al-Fara family was hit, Mahmoud Bassal said. Six members of the Abdeen family were also reportedly killed in another strike. Pictures from the scene showed relatives and neighbours searching the ruins of several destroyed buildings next a large crater. Saleh Adel al-Fara told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme that there had been clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters on Thursday evening, and that his family had gone to sleep “when things quietened down a bit”. “Suddenly, at 2:30 in the morning, I woke up feeling suffocated and started screaming for help. I then found my older brother searching for me under the rubble, telling me that the house had been bombed,” he said. “I don’t remember what happened next. Both my brother and sister were martyred, and my two pregnant sisters were injured. ”He added: “There are no resistance fighters among us, despite what they claim. All the wounded and dead are civilians. ”Another member of the family, Umm al-Ameer al-Fara, told AFP news agency: ""The rocket fell next to us, and we were buried under the rubble. My children and sister were killed. ”The Civil Defence posted a video that it said showed its rescue workers recovering the bodies of the nine children from the al-Faras' home. The same children were also later photographed in body bags at the nearby European Gaza hospital. Reuters said the bodies of another three children were brought to Nasser hospital, in Khan Younis. A resident, who asked not to be named, told BBC Arabic that Israeli fighter jets and tanks had attacked the area without any warning. “The army stormed into our district, passing right in front of our homes with advanced machinery, and began shooting. They bombed the house of the Abdeen family, as well as the homes of some neighbours,” the man said. “In the past, we would receive warnings via SMS to evacuate the area before military operations. This time, they targeted unarmed civilians who had nothing to do with any [armed] organisations. ”Health officials also told the Associated Press that the attack included both air and artillery strikes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that its troops ""operated following intelligence information, dismantling terrorist infrastructure and eliminating numerous terrorists"" in the Khan Younis area overnight. ""Reports on the number of casualties in the area do not align with the current information held by the IDF,"" it added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Israeli strikes kill 38 in south Gaza, health ministry says","Israeli strikes kill 38 in south Gaza, health ministry says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq8vx77yz34o,articles/article_3133.txt,results/article_3133.txt.json
3134,2024-11-06 15:29:18.265000+00:00,/news/articles/crr9q249pveo,"At least 40 people were killed in Israeli air strikes in eastern Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The Israeli military said the strikes, in the governorates of Baalbek and Bekaa, hit operatives and infrastructure of the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Lebanon's culture minister said one of the strikes seriously damaged an Ottoman-era building in the vicinity of the Roman ruins in the city of Baalbek, which is a Unesco World Heritage site. Strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Wednesday, after the Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings. The military said it struck Hezbollah command centres, weapons stores and other infrastructure. A later military warning covered four neighbourhoods in southern Beirut including an area near Lebanon's only commercial airport, which has continued to operate during the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Soon afterwards, pictures showed a large fireball and thick black smoke rising into the night sky above Beirut. Meanwhile, a rocket fired by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed an Israeli man near a kibbutz in northern Israel, paramedics said. On Wednesday morning, Lebanon's Civil Defence agency said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from a four-storey apartment building that was hit by an Israeli strike the previous evening. The building in Barja, a predominantly Sunni Muslim coastal town south of Beirut that is outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds, was reportedly housing displaced people. The Israeli military said it had struck ""terror infrastructure” belonging to Hezbollah. A man who lived on one of the upper floors of the apartment building said his son and wife were injured by falling masonry. ""These rocks that you see here weigh 100kg, they fell on a 13kg kid,"" Moussa Zahran told Reuters news agency as he surveyed the damage. “I removed [the rocks] and. . . handed my son to the civil defence through the window. I carried my wife and came downstairs and got out behind the building. . . I thank God, glory be to Him, for this miracle. ”An Irish Times correspondent cited a member of the civil defence at the scene as saying that those killed whose bodies were found complete included seven women and three children, external - a seven-month-old baby and two girls aged seven and 12. Neighbours also said the building was housing displaced people who had fled from other areas, she added. There was no evacuation warning ahead of the strike, according to Reuters. The Lebanese health ministry gave a preliminary death toll of 20 from the strike on Barja late on Tuesday but did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday. On Wednesday evening, the ministry said 40 people had been killed and 53 others injured in a series of Israeli strikes in Bekaa and Baalbek governorates, which make up most of the eastern Bekaa Valley. They included 16 people killed in the village of Nasriyah and 11 in Baalbek city, it added. Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada also told the director-general of Unesco that one of the strikes had ""caused serious damage to the ancient Manshiya building"" in Baalbek city, which he said dated back to the Ottoman period and was located in the vicinity of the ruins of several Roman temples. ""The destruction of this exceptional monument next to a Unesco World Heritage site is an irremediable loss for Lebanon and for world heritage,"" he warned. An AFP news agency correspondent also reported that the famous 19th Century Palmyra Hotel near the Roman ruins was damaged by nearby strikes, which the health ministry said killed two people. On Thursday morning, the Israeli military put out a statement saying it had killed approximately 60 Hezbollah fighters in strikes on about 20 ""terror targets"" in the area of Baalbek and north of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) north of the border with Israel. Dozens of other strikes targeted a rocket launcher, weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure, it added. The military also said it had killed the commander of Hezbollah’s forces in the southern border region of Khiam, and that a number of other Hezbollah fighters had been killed by air strikes and by troops operating inside southern Lebanon over the past day. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s new secretary general, Naim Qassem, said in a speech that the group had “tens of thousands of trained resistance combatants” ready to fight and that nowhere in Israel was “beyond the reach of our drones and missiles”. ""I will tell you very clearly, our conviction is that only one thing can stop this war of aggression, and that is the battlefield,"" he declared, adding that he did not believe ""political action"" would end the conflict. The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired about 170 rockets into northern and central Israel on Wednesday. In the evening, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said a man was killed by a rocket near the kibbutz of Kfar Masaryk, which is south of the coastal town of Acre. Paramedics said the man was found in a field with severe shrapnel wounds and that he was pronounced dead at the scene. Later, Israeli media identified him as Sivan Sade, an 18-year-old resident of Kfar Masaryk who had been working in the field. Also on Wednesday, Israeli media said one rocket hit a car park near Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport, but the Israel Airport Authority said its operations were not affected. Hezbollah said it targeted the Tzrifin military base near the airport. A large section of a rocket also hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, just north of Tel Aviv. Since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah six weeks ago, at least 2,400 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced across Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group’s leadership, including Qassem’s predecessor Hassan Nasrallah, and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.

""It is the largest displacement movement that may have happened,"" Najib Mikati said. Lebanon's health ministry reported more than 50 people killed in Sunday's strikes - two days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel. In a separate development, Israel said it had carried out ""large-scale"" air strikes on military targets of the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen.

""We need to keep hitting Hezbollah hard,"" Israel's military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said. Another Israeli strike in the central Beirut neighbourhood of Kola early on Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group said in a statement. The PFLP is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, a coalition recognised at the UN as the official representative of the Palestinians. The group is also considered a terrorist organisation by both the US and EU. The statement named those killed as military security chief Mohammad Abdel-Aal, military commander Imad Odeh, and fighter Abdel Rahman Abdel-Aal. Lebanon's Prime Minister Mikati said the wave of air strikes had forced people to flee from Beirut and other parts of the country, including the southern border areas. The local authorities are struggling to assist everyone in need, with shelters and hospitals under growing pressure, BBC correspondents in Lebanon report. Aya Ayoub, aged 25, told the BBC she had to flee her house in Beirut’s southern Tahweetet al-Ghadir suburb with her family of six as it was too dangerous to stay. Around her house, she said, ""all the buildings are completely destroyed"", and she was currently staying with another 16 people in a house in Beirut. ""We left on Friday and had no place to go. We stayed until 02:00 in the streets until a group of people helped us get into a residential building that was under construction. We are living on candles at night, and have to get water and food from outside”. Sara Tohmaz, a 34-year-old journalist, told the BBC she had left her house near Beirut with her mother and two siblings last Friday. It took them almost 10 hours to reach Jordan through Syria by car, she said. “I think we are lucky enough to have a place to stay in Jordan, where my mother’s relatives are based. We don’t know what will happen next, and don’t know when we will be back,"" Tohmaz added. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then hundreds of people, including many Hezbollah fighters, have been killed, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Also on Sunday, Israel said it carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, striking power plants and a port in Ras Isa and Hudaydah. Footage later emerged showing a huge explosion at the port. Israel says it targeted the sites in response to recent missile attacks from the Houthis, as well as to destroy facilities being used to transport Iranian weapons. The Houthis, a Shia group controlling large areas of Yemen, condemned the Israeli strikes as a ""brutal aggression"". They said four people were killed and 33 injured, vowing revenge. There are mounting international fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Washington warned Israel against an all-out war with Hezbollah or Iran, saying a major conflict would leave Israelis unable to return to their homes in the north.",Israeli strikes may have displaced million people - Lebanon PM,Israeli strikes may have displaced million people - Lebanon PM,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o,articles/article_3135.txt,results/article_3135.txt.json

Dozens of people were also injured in strikes that hit Ibn Rushd school and Al-Aqsa Martyrs mosque in Deir al-Balah early on Sunday morning, the ministry said. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating within ""command and control"" centres at the sites. In north Gaza, Israeli forces surrounded the Jabalia area in response to what it said were Hamas efforts to rebuild. The military also issued new possible evacuation zones in the north and re-opened routes to a humanitarian area. Following the strikes in central Gaza, videos verified by the BBC as being from the mosque show bodies and blood on the ground among the rubble, while footage at the school shows the structure on fire and a man being pulled out on a stretcher. Earlier, the Hamas-run civil defence agency said 21 people were killed and a large number wounded in the strike on the mosque, according to the AFP news agency. Reuters news agency reported that at least 93 people were injured in the airstrikes, according to data from Gaza's Hamas-run media office. Sunday's strikes occurred almost exactly one year on from 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, according to the health ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. According to the United Nations, which uses Gaza health ministry figures and considers them reliable, 187 people were killed in Gaza from 30 September to 4 October alone. In a statement on the strike on the mosque, Hamas accused Israel of ""bombing citizens' homes and demolishing them over their heads, resulting in the deaths and injuries of dozens"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that ""before the attacks many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including the use of precision weaponry, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information. ""  The IDF accused Hamas of ""exploiting civilian institutions and the population as human shields for terrorist acts"". Later on Sunday, the IDF said it carried out an air strike on another school in northern Gaza, saying it was being used as a Hamas ""command and control complex"". Hamas has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Elsewhere in Gaza, Israel's military began to surround Jabalia in the north overnight in response to what the IDF said were efforts by Hamas to rebuild in the area. The military said it had struck ""dozens of military targets"" before and during the ground operation. The IDF warned the public that north Gaza is ""still considered a dangerous combat zone"" and published a new map on Sunday showing zones for potential evacuation in the north. It also said it had expanded the humanitarian zone in al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, although it is still smaller than it was at the start of July. Both the mosque and the school hit on Sunday are located in the humanitarian zone. The IDF said it had re-opened two evacuation routes from the north to access the zone. Israel does not allow international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it hard to verify the facts on the ground.","Israeli strikes on Gaza mosque and school kill 26, health ministry says","Israeli strikes on Gaza mosque and school kill 26, health ministry says","israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0jwv16qwqjo,articles/article_3136.txt,results/article_3136.txt.json

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran ""recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,"" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks. Tehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was ""limited damage"" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness ""to defend the state of Israel"". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be ""obliged to respond"".  The US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was ""targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm"" and suggested that was ""precisely what transpired"" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets ""in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against ""Iranian aggression"" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to ""de-escalate the situation across the region"". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed ""deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation"", while Jordan described the attack as a ""dangerous escalation"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation"". Iran's missile attack on IsraelThe extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. ""It was an echoing sound. . . terrible and horrifying,"" the agency quoted him as saying. ""Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it. ""Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF.  Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.","Israeli strikes on Iran kill four soldiers, Iran says","Israeli strikes on Iran kill four soldiers, Iran says",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yr5ek4r8ro,articles/article_3137.txt,results/article_3137.txt.json
3138,2024-09-24 21:27:59.728000+00:00,/news/articles/c748n1258z1o,"Lebanon’s health minister has said what is happening in his country is “carnage”, as hospitals struggle to cope with the number of casualties from two days of widespread Israeli air strikes targeting the armed group Hezbollah. Dr Firass Abiad told the BBC it was “clear” that many of the 550 people killed in Monday’s attacks were civilians, including children and women. Israel said it hit hundreds of Hezbollah sites, accusing the group of hiding weapons in residential areas. On Tuesday, the Israeli military killed the head of Hezbollah’s rocket forces as the strikes continued, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the group was leading Lebanon “to the edge of the abyss”. Hezbollah responded by firing more than 300 rockets into northern Israel, injuring six people, according to the military. Although neither side seemed interested in backing down, US President Joe Biden told the UN General Assembly that a full-scale conflict was “not in anyone's interest” and insisted that a “diplomatic solution is still possible”. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the world “cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza”. Nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Monday’s Israeli air strikes across southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley had resulted in the deadliest day in the country since at least 2006 - the last time Hezbollah and Israel fought a war. Abiad told a news conference on Tuesday that 50 children, 94 women and a number of medical workers were among the 558 people killed. More than 50 hospitals were currently treating the 1,835 other people who were wounded, he added. Later, in an interview with the BBC, the health minister described what happened as “carnage. ”“If you look at the people who were brought to the emergency rooms it’s clear that they’re civilians. They are not the combatants that the Israelis claim they are,” he said. “We know about the victims of the attacks because our ambulances are the ones that transferred them to hospitals,” he added. “[They were] civilians who were doing their normal things. ”When comparing the current hostilities with the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Abiad said: “Definitely we’re looking at a more cruel war, especially in the way civilians are being targeted. ” The UN Human Rights Office also expressed alarm at the number of casualties in Monday’s strikes, saying they could have violated international humanitarian law. When asked by journalists about the audio and text messages sent by the Israeli military to people in Lebanon, telling them to evacuate areas near buildings where Hezbollah stored weapons, spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said: “Telling civilians to flee doesn't make it ok to then strike those areas, knowing full well that the impact on civilians will be huge. ”Roads in southern Lebanon were also congested for a second day, as thousands more people fled north to get away from the Israeli attacks. Journeys that would usually take an hour were lasting 12 or more. At a shelter in Beirut, 65-year-old Maryam told the BBC that she had travelled all night with 12 relatives in one small car. “We got together and left. We didn’t want to leave our homes, because leaving your home is difficult,” she said. “We arrived here at four in the morning. With our children. It’s because of our children that we left. ” During a visit to an intelligence base, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would “continue striking Hezbollah” until it had achieved its war goal of returning displaced Israeli civilians to their homes along the northern border. He also addressed the people of Lebanon, insisting that “our war is not with you” and warning them that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was ""leading you to the edge of the abyss”. “I told you yesterday to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage. Whoever has a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage will no longer have a home,” he said. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told an evening briefing that Hezbollah had turned southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley “into a combat zone” and that aircraft had continued to strike targets there throughout Tuesday. He also released video footage that he said showed secondary explosions during strikes on residential buildings that indicated missiles and a truck carrying a rocket launcher had been stored inside them. Hagari also said the head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket unit, Ibrahim Qubaisi, had been killed in an air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday afternoon, along with at least two other commanders who were with him at the time. Qubaisi was “a key figure in activating missiles” and was “responsible for a series of attacks on Israeli territory”, he added. Hezbollah confirmed in a Telegram post that Qubaisi had been ""martyred"" in a strike. The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed and 15 others injured in an “Israeli enemy raid” that partly destroyed the top two floors of a block of flats in Beirut’s Ghobeiry neighbourhood. Hezbollah said that its fighters had fired barrages of rockets towards more than a dozen Israeli towns and military bases, as well as an explosives factory. It also claimed that a new type of rocket had been used to strike the IDF’s Samson unit. Sirens continued to sound throughout the day across northern Israel and interceptor rockets from Israel’s Iron Dome air defence system were seen streaking into the sky. Some of the approximately 300 rockets landed, causing damage and injuring six civilians and soldiers, most of them lightly, according to Hagari.","Israeli strikes on Lebanon causing ‘carnage’, health minister says","Israeli strikes on Lebanon causing ‘carnage’, health minister says","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c748n1258z1o,articles/article_3138.txt,results/article_3138.txt.json
3139,2024-11-20 15:03:09.588000+00:00,/news/articles/clydpg9kj88o,"At least 36 people have been killed and 50 others injured in Israeli air strikes on residential buildings and an industrial area in the central Syrian town of Palmyra, Syrian state media report. The Sana news agency cited a military source as saying that Israeli jets attacked from the direction of the Jordanian border to the south at around 13:30 (10:30 GMT) and that the strikes causes significant material damage. A UK-based monitoring group reported that the strikes hit a weapons depot and other locations in and around an area where families of Iran-backed militia fighters were, killing 68 Syrian and foreign fighters. The Israeli military said it did not comment on foreign reports. Israel has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups such as Hezbollah. The Israeli strikes in Syria have reportedly been more frequent since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. Videos and photos posted on social media following Wednesday’s strikes appear to show three large columns of black smoke rising from the Palmyra area, external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, cited its sources on the ground as saying that Israeli fighter jets struck three locations in the town. Two were in the al-Jamiya neighbourhood, including a weapons depot near the industrial zone inhabited by families of Iran-backed fighters of Iraqi and other foreign nationalities, it said. The third location was nearby and targeted a meeting attended by leaders of Iran-backed militias based in Palmyra and the surrounding desert as well as leaders of the Iraqi group Nujaba and Hezbollah, it added. The SOHR initially reported that 41 people were killed, but later said the death toll had risen to 68. It identified them as 42 Syrian members of Iran-backed militias, and 22 foreign members, mostly from Nujaba, and four Lebanese members of Hezbollah. Last Thursday, Israel confirmed that it had carried out several air strikes in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which Syrian state media said killed 15 people. The Israeli military said it had struck “terrorist infrastructure sites and command centres” belonging to the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The previous day, the military said it had hit smuggling routes between Syria and Lebanon that were used to deliver weapons from Iran to Hezbollah.","Israeli strikes on Syria's Palmyra kill 36, state media say","Israeli strikes on Syria's Palmyra kill 36, state media say",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydpg9kj88o,articles/article_3139.txt,results/article_3139.txt.json
3140,2024-09-09 06:05:29.409000+00:00,/news/articles/cy0nrd730jdo,"At least 18 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on a number of military sites in central Syria, the Syrian health minister says. State news agency Sana cited Hassan al-Ghabbash as saying another 37 people were injured in the attacks in the vicinity of Masyaf, in Hama province, on Sunday night. A UK-based monitoring group reported that 26 people were killed and that the targets included a scientific research centre near Masyaf that was used to develop weapons. The Israeli military said it would not comment on foreign media reports of the strikes, which Syria's foreign ministry condemned as ""blatant aggression"" and Iran's foreign ministry called a ""criminal attack"". However, Israel has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran - Israel's main foe - and allied armed groups. The Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. Sana's report cited a Syrian military source as saying that Israeli aircraft flying over north-western Lebanon launched missiles at “a number of military sites in the central region” at around 23:20 (20:20 GMT) on Sunday. ""Our air defence shot down some missiles,” the military source added. The news agency said the strikes also caused damage to the Masyaf-Wadi al-Oyoun highway and that a fire broke out in the forested Hair Abbas area. Later, the Syrian foreign ministry said the attack had targeted ""several residential areas"", while local authorities reported that key infrastructure had been damaged, including a fibre optic cable running underneath the highway and a high-voltage power line, according to Sana. State-run Al-Ikhbariya al-Suriyah TV also broadcast footage purportedly showing a damaged building in the port city of Tartous, west of Masyaf. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground - reported that Israeli strikes destroyed buildings and military facilities in ""the scientific research area in Masyaf"", on the Masyaf-Wadi al-Oyoun highway and in Hair Abbas. It said at least 26 people were killed, including five civilians, four members of Syrian government forces and 14 Syrians working with pro-Iran groups. Another three bodies were unidentified, it added. The SOHR said Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers had been stationed in the scientific research area for six years as part of a programme to develop short- and medium-range precision missiles and drones. However, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told reporters in Tehran: “We do not confirm what was reported by media outlets linked to the Zionist regime [Israel] about an attack on an Iranian centre or a centre under Iran's protection. ” A senior regional military source close to Damascus and Tehran also denied a Reuters news agency report which cited two intelligence sources as saying that a major military research centre for chemical arms production was hit several times. Western intelligence agencies have previously alleged that a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) near Masyaf has been used to produce chemical weapons in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Syrian government has denied the claim. However, the facility was reportedly targeted in a suspected Israeli strike in September 2017, a day after a deadly chemical attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria that the UN and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded was carried out by the Syrian air force. According to the SOHR, Israeli air and artillery strikes have targeted Syrian territory on 64 occasions since the start of the year, resulting in the damage or destruction of about 140 targets, including weapons depots, vehicles and Iran-backed militia headquarters. The strikes have killed at least 208 fighters - including 46 members of Syrian government forces, 43 members of Hezbollah and 24 Iranian Revolutionary Guards - as well as 22 civilians, the monitoring group says. In April, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an air strike on a consulate building in Damascus which killed two senior Revolutionary Guards commanders. Iran retaliated by carrying out its first direct military attack against Israel. It launched 300 missiles and drones, but almost all of them were shot down by Israeli and US-led forces.","Israeli strikes on Syrian military sites kill 18, health minister says","Israeli strikes on Syrian military sites kill 18, health minister says",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0nrd730jdo,articles/article_3140.txt,results/article_3140.txt.json
3141,2024-11-10 10:43:39.694000+00:00,/news/articles/cd6v3zq2jvjo,"Israeli strikes on northern Lebanon and Gaza have killed dozens of people including several children, rescuers and officials say. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 23 people including seven children were killed on Sunday in Almat near Byblos, to the north of the capital Beirut. In northern Gaza, the civil defence agency said at least 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes on two houses in the besieged enclave. The first strike early Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing ""at least 25"" people, including 13 children, and injuring more than 30, according to the agency. Another five people were killed in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City and some are still missing in the aftermath, the civil defence agency said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hezbollah had stored weapons at, and were operating from, the site it had targeted in Lebanon. It added ""numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance and precise intelligence"". The IDF said it struck a site in Jabalia where ""terrorists were operating"" and in the case of that strike as well, steps had been taken to mitigate civilian harm. The details of both incidents were under review, it said. The Lebanese health ministry said rescue workers were still searching the rubble after the strike in Almat. Israel has escalated its campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Its main focus had been southern Lebanon, aiming to weaken the group’s capacity to launch rockets across the border. But in recent weeks, operations have targeted cities and towns throughout Lebanon. In a separate incident to the south, three medical workers were killed when an Israeli strike hit an Islamic Health Authority building in Adloun, the health ministry said. In a further update, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Sunday that 53 people were killed on Saturday, including 28 in the south and 17 in Baalbek. The IDF said it had intercepted Hezbollah rockets on Saturday after the militant group launched 70 projectiles, according to Israel’s military. Since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah seven weeks ago, at least 3,189 people have been killed,14,078 injured and more than 1.2 million displaced across Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities. In Gaza, aid groups say Jabalia and other parts of northern Gaza have been under siege since early October when Israel launched a new ground offensive against the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Dr Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, told AP news agency that his facility had received 17 bodies from Jabalia so far, including those of nine women, and the death toll was likely to rise. Eyewitnesses described the Israeli strike as an ""earthquake"". ""We were just sitting peacefully. These are innocent citizens who don’t belong to any military organisation or faction,"" eyewitness and relative to the victims Hamza Alloush told Reuters. The house ""was bombed over the residents’ heads without warning, which led to the martyrdom of everyone inside. Those who were lucky enough to survive were thrown onto the trees, onto the neighbours, and the remains are still scattered under the rubble"", he said. Videos and images showed multiple bodies wrapped in blankets in the back of cars and laid to the ground at a hospital. Another strike in Gaza City killed a welfare ministry official and seven members of his family, including his wife and children, medics and relatives said. Israel is facing a US deadline that expires within days to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on military cooperation. The UN previously said the ""darkest moment"" of the war in Gaza was unfolding in the northern part of the territory. Meanwhile, news agency AFP reported that the Syrian defence ministry said an Israeli air strike on a residential building south of the capital Damascus had killed seven civilians on Sunday. The fatalities included women and children, with 20 people also injured, the ministry said in a statement to AFP. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told the news agency the attack targeted members of Hezbollah. The UK-based monitoring group said the strike targeted ""the building where Lebanese families and members of the movement live"". There was no immediate comment from the IDF, AFP reported.  On Saturday, Israel rejected warnings of famine in northern Gaza from global food security experts, saying the group relied on ""partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests"". The independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said there was a strong likelihood of imminent famine and that immediate action was required to ease a catastrophic situation. Israel said it had increased aid efforts, including opening an additional crossing on Friday to get more aid into southern Gaza. The IDF later said it had delivered 11 trucks of food, water and medical aid into Jabalia and Beit Hanoun on Thursday. Meanwhile, efforts to reach a ceasefire have stalled, with Qatar suspending its work as a mediator until Hamas and Israel ""show their willingness"" to negotiate. Israel launched its current military offensive in Gaza after Hamas' attack on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages back to Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN sees as reliable, has reported a death toll of more than 43,600 people since the start of the war. Many more bodies are believed to remain under the rubble of bombarded buildings. In Lebanon, Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group’s leadership and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israeli authorities say more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the past year.","Israeli strikes on north Lebanon and Gaza kill dozens, officials and rescuers say","Israeli strikes on north Lebanon and Gaza kill dozens, officials and rescuers say",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6v3zq2jvjo,articles/article_3141.txt,results/article_3141.txt.json
3142,2024-10-20 21:18:14.244000+00:00,/news/articles/cz6wq71ly5po,"Israel has carried out air strikes targeting branches of a financial association linked with Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital Beirut, as well as the south and east of the country. There were chaotic scenes in parts of Beirut late on Sunday, as people tried to get to areas that they thought would be safer and multiple explosions were heard. The Israeli military said it targeted money held by Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH). It offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support, but Israel and the US accuse it of being a cover for the Iran-backed group to fund its activities. There was no immediate comment from AQAH or Hezbollah. The attacks appeared to mark an expansion of Israel’s war against Hezbollah, going beyond military infrastructure used by the group. They took place hours before US President Joe Biden’s special envoy to the Middle East arrived in Beirut to explore the possibility of a negotiated end to the war. Israel began an intense air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel. More than 2,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,800 in the past five weeks, according to the country’s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli air strikes targeting branches of AQAH happened about 20 minutes after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders, at around 21:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Sunday. According to the Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA), there were 11 attacks on Dahieh, in southern Beirut. Videos posted on social media showed one AQAH branch on fire in the Laylaki area, external, only 500m (1,800ft) away from the runway of Lebanon’s only functioning commercial airport, and another just to the north in Burj al-Barajneh. A third video showed a multi-storey building where there was an AQAH branch collapsing in the Chiyah area, external. The NNA also said that strikes hit branches in Nabatieh, Tyre and Shehabieh in southern Lebanon, as well as those in the eastern Bekaa Valley towns of Baalbek, Hermel and Rayak - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. ""Our store and our livelihood are gone,” business owner Ahmed told Reuters news agency outside a severely damaged AQAH branch in Zahrani. “This neighbourhood is all civilian, with nothing here. ”It was not clear whether the strikes targeting AQAH caused any casualties. But the NNA reported on Monday that six women and children were killed in an air strike on a home in Baalbek, and that two bodies were recovered from a destroyed building in the southern town of Srifa. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck “dozens of facilities and sites” across Lebanon that were used by Hezbollah to “finance its terrorist activities”. It alleged that Hezbollah stored billions of dollars at branches of AQAH, and that it used the money to purchase weapons and pay members of its military wing. “The purpose of these strikes is to target the ability of Hezbollah to function both during the war but also afterwards, to rebuild and to rearm the organisation on the day after, and [to target] the grip Hezbollah has on large parts of the Lebanese society,” an Israeli intelligence official told reporters. Hezbollah - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and others - is more than just a Shia Islamist armed group. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support. AQAH is a key part of Hezbollah’s social services network. Before the Israeli strikes, it had more than 30 branches, often located on the ground floor of residential buildings. Many people came to depend on AQAH after Lebanon sank into a deep economic crisis five years ago, causing the local currency to lose 90% of its value and commercial banks to restrict foreign currency withdrawals. The association allowed people to take out small, interest-free loans in dollars backed by gold or a guarantor, and to open savings accounts. Hezbollah’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech in 2021 that AQAH had provided $3.7bn (£2.8bn) in loans to 1.8 million people in Lebanon since it was founded in the early 1980s, and that around 300,000 people had loans with it at that time. Nasrallah also claimed that AQAH had been strengthened by the US sanctions imposed since 2007, when American officials said the association was being used by Hezbollah as a cover to manage its financial activities and to gain access to the international financial system. A Hezbollah press officer told the BBC on Monday afternoon that neither the group nor AQAH had issued any statements regarding the air strikes. Earlier, a statement attributed to AQAH was circulated on social media which said people's deposits with the association were “safe”.  The Israeli military also announced on Monday that its troops were continuing to carry out operations in southern Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure and weaponry. Hezbollah fighters meanwhile continued to fire rockets into northern Israel, with the military reporting that 60 projectiles had crossed the border by Monday afternoon. About 200 projectiles were detected on Sunday, when the military said its warplanes had conducted ""an intelligence-based strike on a command centre of Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and an underground weapons workshop in Beirut"". Also on Sunday, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) accused Israeli forces of deliberately demolishing an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN peacekeeping position in the southern town of Marwahin. It followed similar incidents in recent weeks. In a separate development, the Lebanese army said three of its soldiers were killed after a military vehicle was hit by an Israeli air strike in Nabatieh, southern Lebanon. Lebanon's army has historically stayed out of cross-border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah - but a number of its troops have been killed in Israeli attacks since fighting escalated last month. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the two incidents.",Israeli strikes target Hezbollah-linked financial association in Lebanon,Israeli strikes target Hezbollah-linked financial association in Lebanon,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6wq71ly5po,articles/article_3142.txt,results/article_3142.txt.json

Julian Gao, Ruby Hamill, Daniel Jones and Sayed Shah were arrested after staging a protest at the Teledyne factory in Shipley, which specialises in supplying electronics to the aerospace and defence sectors. Following the incident all four were charged with causing criminal damage and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property. However, after a trial at Bradford Crown Court the jury failed to reach verdicts on any of the charges. All four defendants will face a re-trial at the same court in February 2026. At the start of the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the group using an angle-grinder to cut through a security fence in the early hours of 2 April. The group was filmed carrying items including sledgehammers, crowbars, ladders and flags and staging a protest on the roof of the premises. The three men and a woman, who were wearing red boiler suits, were then captured on drone footage smashing roof tiles and windows. When police officers arrived they challenged the group on the roof and were told they were protesting at the site due to the war in Gaza, the court heard. Prosecutor Gerald Hendron told the court the total damage caused externally and internally to the premises had been £571,383. Teledyne Space and Defence Ltd supplies the defence and aerospace industry. Mr Hendron said components were used in the manufacture of weapons used by the British Army and NATO, as well as weapons purchased by other countries such as Ukraine and Israel. On Friday, after about seven hours of deliberation over two days, Judge Sophie McKone asked the jury if they would be able to reach verdicts if they were given more time.

3150,2024-08-11 04:19:47.328000+00:00,/news/articles/cn0lx2xgn55o,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has condemned the loss of civilian life in an Israeli air strike against a school building in Gaza on Saturday. More than 70 people were killed at the building which sheltered displaced Palestinians, the director of a hospital has told the BBC. Ms Harris said ""far too many"" civilians had been killed ""yet again""and reiterated calls for a hostage deal and a ceasefire, echoing comments made by the White House. An Israeli military spokesman said al-Taba’een school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denies.  Speaking at a campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona, Ms Harris said Israel had a right to ""go after Hamas"" but also has ""an important responsibility"" to avoid civilian casualties. Saturday's air strike has been criticised by Western and regional powers, with Egypt saying it showed Israel had no desire to reach a ceasefire or end the Gaza war. Fadl Naeem, head of al-Ahli Hospital where many of the casualties were taken, said around 70 victims were indentified in the hours after the strike - with the remains of many others so badly disfigured that identification was difficult. Israel's military said it had ""precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the al-Taba'een school"". A statement by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency said ""at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists"" were ""eliminated"" in the attack. IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said “various intelligence indications” suggest a “high probability” that the commander of Islamic Jihad’s Central Camps Brigade, Ashraf Juda, was at the Taba’een school when it was struck. He said it is not yet clear whether the commander was killed in the attack. The BBC cannot independently verify casualty figures from either side. The Israeli spokesman said the casualty figures released by Hamas officials ""do not align with the information held by the IDF, the precise munitions used, and the accuracy of the strike"". Hamas described the attack as a ""horrific crime and a dangerous escalation"" in Israel's ""war of extermination against the Palestinian people"". US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Hamas had been using schools ""as locations to gather and operate out of"". ""But we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimise civilian harm,"" he added. Israel has attacked several such shelters in Gaza in the past few weeks. According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 school buildings in Gaza have been directly hit or damaged as of 6 July, with more than a dozen targeted since. Al-Taba’een school housed more 1,000 people - having recently received dozens of displaced people from the town of Beit Hanoun, after the Israeli army ordered them to leave their homes. The building also served as a mosque and the Israeli strike hit during dawn prayers, witnesses said. Jaafar Taha, a student who lives near the school, told the BBC the sound of the bombing was followed by screaming and noise. ""'Save us, save us,' they were screaming,"" he said. ""The scene was horrific. There were body parts everywhere and blood covering the walls. ""Salim Oweis, spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC the attack was ""really outrageous"". ""All those schools are really packed with civilians, children, mothers and families, who are taking refuge in any empty space whether it's a school or it's a mosque, whatever it is, even in hospital yards. ""This strike has again drawn graphic attention to a controversial dynamic of the Gaza war. Israel claims that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to plan and carry out attacks, and that is why it has been targeting hospitals and schools - sites protected under international law. Hamas has consistently denied the accusations. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war.

3151,2024-08-02 09:39:15.647000+00:00,/news/articles/cql8ly2g10no,"US President Joe Biden has said that the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh “doesn’t help” talks over a potential ceasefire in Gaza. Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran, on Wednesday. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel, although Israel is yet to comment on his death. Haniyeh was Hamas’s most senior official and was highly involved in ceasefire and hostage release talks from his base in Qatar. Mr Biden said he was “very concerned” about rising tensions in the Middle East. ""We have the basis for a ceasefire. He [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] should move on it and they [Hamas] should move on it now. "" Israel and Hamas recently resumed tentative, indirect talks to try to reach a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, though there have been conflicting accounts of progress. At the end of May, Mr Biden outlined what he said were the terms of an Israeli ceasefire proposal. This has become the basis for on-off indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel since then, with Qatar, Egypt and the US acting as mediators. Earlier this week, Israel and Hamas accused each other of obstructing progress. Hamas said Israel had introduced new conditions, while Mr Netanyahu's office said Hamas had demanded 29 changes to the proposal. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Biden's comments were his first on Haniyeh's assassination since the Hamas chief was killed. The US president spoke to journalists at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, ahead of welcoming home American citizens as part of a prisoner exchange with Russia. He said he had spoken to Mr Netanyahu earlier on Thursday and had promised to protect Israel ""against all threats from Iran"", which has vowed to retaliate. Iran is Hamas's most important backer and is an arch-foe of Israel. Iran vows revenge after Hamas leader assassinated in TehranWhat does Haniyeh's killing mean for Gaza ceasefire? Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Mr Netanyahu said after the killing that Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days. Haniyeh’s assassination came at a time of soaring tensions in the Middle East. On Saturday, 12 children and young people were killed after a strike on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel blamed Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement and vowed ""severe"" retaliation, though Hezbollah has denied involvement. On Tuesday, hours before the killing of Haniyeh, Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, who it said was behind the attack on the Golan Heights, in a targeted air strike in Beirut.","Killing of Hamas leader 'doesn't help' ceasefire talks, says Biden","Killing of Hamas leader 'doesn't help' ceasefire talks, says Biden","israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cql8ly2g10no,articles/article_3151.txt,results/article_3151.txt.json

Bilha Yinon, 75, was murdered along with her husband, Yaakov, at their home in Netiv Haasara, when hundreds of gunmen from Gaza attacked communities in southern Israel on 7 October. The Yinons' home was burnt to the ground, and while Yaakov's remains were found, there was no trace of Bilha, although she was known to have been with him at the time.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had now determined ""after complex testing"" of evidence in the area of the house that Bilha was killed. Previously even fingertip searches in the ash and debris had failed to find as much as a trace of Bilha's DNA. The couple's children had long accepted their mother was murdered on the day of the attack, but her death has only now been officially declared ""based on a combination of findings"", the IDF said. Bilha and Yaakov were together in their house, on the edge of the border with Gaza, when it was attacked on the morning of the invasion. One of the couple's daughters, Maayan, said her father WhatsApped at the time to say he and Bilha were in a safe room and could hear shooting and rockets. ""The house got a direct hit and was on fire within minutes,"" Maayan told Israeli TV in February. Virtually the whole structure was reduced to ash. Writing on X, Maoz Yinon a son of the couple, said his parents did not die in vain, external. ""They did not die for this war. They died for peace. ""I have no doubt in my heart that [Bilha Yinon] would be so proud of the journey my family are on - with Israeli and Palestinian partners - to create a path to peace, through hope and reconciliation,"" he said. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in the unprecedented attack, and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

Sir Keir Starmer said ""we are ramping up the contingency plans” and warned that ""we are potentially at a brink"" of all-out war. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is sending 700 troops to nearby Cyprus to prepare for the possible evacuation of British nationals from Lebanon and the government ""continues to advise against all travel to Lebanon"". Britons have been advised to book flights out of the country - but there are limited options available, with most airlines except the national carrier having cancelled flights and ceased operating and reports that those remaining are full. The situation in the country, where Israeli strikes reportedly killed more than 560 people this week, is described as deteriorating ""rapidly, with devastating consequences"". Lebanon’s health minister has told the BBC what is happening in his country is “carnage”, as hospitals struggle to cope with the number of casualties from two days of widespread Israeli air strikes targeting Hezbollah. Asked by reporters how the British prime minister would ensure the situation wasn’t a repeat of the chaos in the Afghan capital Kabul when the Taliban seized control in August 2021, Sir Keir said: ""The most important message from me to British nationals in Lebanon is to leave immediately. ""It is important that we’ve been really, really clear: now is the time to leave. ”The handling of the Afghan evacuation, where 15,000 people were airlifted out of the country, was widely criticised as mismanaged and chaotic. An estimated 10,000 UK citizens are currently in Lebanon. A senior government source said that the difference, for now at least, was that there were still commercial flights leaving Lebanon and British nationals should book a seat. US citizens have also been told to leave the country. The US Embassy in Lebanon said that most airlines had suspended or cancelled flights with many flights sold out, and urged people to book any ticket available. Almost every airline operating in Lebanon has stopped flying in and out of the country except for the national airline, Middle East Airlines (MEA). Follow live updatesAlistair, a British national who is married to a Lebanese woman and living in Beirut, said that day-to-day life was mainly carrying on as normal. Asked about the intensification of the conflict, he told BBC's PM programme: ""It's a different level isn't it?""He urged diplomats to ""get a deal made so the violence ceases"" and to ""bring peace because the ordinary folks here are just recipients of whatever is dealt out"". The 700 British troops deployed to Cyprus will join 500 military personnel who were sent there over the summer as part of the MoD's contingency plans for an evacuation operation. Two British warships are already in the region and Royal Air Force planes and helicopters on standby. Asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he sensed the world was on the brink of all-out war in the Middle East, Sir Keir said he was “deeply concerned”. He said he “put it in those terms, that we are potentially at a brink point, and we have to come back from the brink”. He repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation, along with other ministers. Defence Secretary John Healey said: “We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. ""Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British nationals should the situation deteriorate. ""I want to thank the British personnel who are deploying in the region for their commitment and professionalism. ”Healey held a meeting with fellow ministers, intelligence chiefs and diplomats on Tuesday afternoon to work through the government’s plans. Officials say the UK already has a significant diplomatic and military presence close to Lebanon, including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and two Royal Navy ships - RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan - which have been in the eastern Mediterranean over the summer. The Royal Air Force also has planes and helicopters on standby. The escalating conflict in the Middle East is likely to be a significant topic of discussion for the prime minister and other world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York. Sir Keir arrived in the city on Tuesday evening local time. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. The Israel military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attack has killed more than 41,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Previously sporadic fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October - the day after Hamas's unprecedented attack. Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with Hamas. Hezbollah has launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It has also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. Last week Hezbollah’s communication devices started exploding all across Lebanon. Israel then launched a massive series of air strikes on Monday that have so far killed 560 people according to the Lebanese government. Last year, the British government helped co-ordinate the evacuation of British nationals from Gaza, with some 200 UK citizens thought to be living in the territory before the war broke out.

""Right now there is no way we can stay. The noises, the situation, is just getting very traumatising so we have no choice,"" Amal said. Israel has stepped up its aerial assault of Beirut in the past week, targeting densely populated areas in the city's south that it said was home to Hezbollah leaders and military equipment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"" as fighting continues.  Speaking to the BBC from the airport in Beirut, university student Amal said she loved Lebanon and was ""very upset"" at having to leave. ""We're just going to stay hopeful that it's not going to be for long and we're going to come back to our precious country. ""Amal, who was born in Surrey and has lived in Lebanon for five years, said she and her sisters planned to reunite with family in West Sussex. Her sister Yasmine, who is still in school, said she would have never imagined leaving, but the situation required it. Another British citizen, Libby, 25, boarded a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as ""terrifying"". ""You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,"" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon.

And for once many in Israel, Lebanon and Iran have something in common - a war of nerves. They worry and they wait for what may come next. It feels like the whole region is holding its breath. Is this the slide towards an all-out regional war? Can a ceasefire be wrestled from the ruins of Gaza? How will Iran, and its proxy militia Hezbollah, retaliate against Israel for back-to-back assassinations in Beirut and Tehran? Will they heed calls for restraint?In Lebanon, the stultifying heat of summer is overlaid by a layer of anxiety. Heart-stopping sonic booms interrupt the hum of traffic in Beirut, as Israeli warplanes break the sound barrier in the skies above. Many foreign nationals are gone, heeding the advice of their governments. Plenty of Lebanese have fled too. Others cannot tear themselves away - like the 30-year-old chef of a hip café (Beirut has too many of these to count). She is tattooed and candid but prefers not to be named. “Living in Beirut is like being in a toxic relationship you can’t escape,” she tells me. “I am emotionally attached. I have family abroad, and I could leave, but I don’t want to. We live day to day. And we joke about the situation. ”In the next breath she admits business has suffered, and she has post-traumatic stress disorder. “It’s like a cold war for us,” she says. She is expecting a hotter one but hopes it will be short. International mediators are criss-crossing the region, working overtime to prevent a wider conflict. The US envoy Amos Hochstein is among them. “We continue to believe that a diplomatic resolution is achievable,” he said, “because we continue to believe that no-one truly wants a full-scale war between Lebanon and Israel. ”He was speaking in Beirut on Wednesday, after meeting a close ally of Hezbollah, Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berry. When asked by a reporter if war could be avoided, Mr Hochstein replied: ""I hope so, I believe so. "" But he added that the more time goes by, the greater the chances for accidents and mistakes. The last time Israel and Hezbollah went to war, in 2006, it lasted six weeks and caused major damage and loss of life in Lebanon. More than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed, along with up to 200 Hezbollah fighters. Of the 160 Israelis killed, most were soldiers. All sides agree that a new war would be far more deadly and destructive. And many here in Lebanon agree that the country cannot afford it. The economy is crippled, and the political system is dysfunctional. The government can’t even keep the lights on. “I hope there won’t be a war,” says Hiba Maslkhi. “Lebanon won’t be able to cope. ”We meet the tracksuit-clad 35-year-old on a slip way at the waterfront in Beirut. She’s focused on the Mediterranean, fishing rod in hand. “I hope wiser heads will prevail,” she says, “and that we can control the escalation so that things don’t get out of control. ”She takes every sonic boom personally. “If I hear one, I start to panic, and I wonder if they [Israeli forces] have hit near my house or bombed the airport. ”Hiba, who sells perfume for a living, says Lebanon has already suffered enough. “Ten months is a long time for us to be psychologically destroyed, hiding in our houses,” she says. “We are scared to start businesses to earn some money because we think war might be around the corner. ” The current round of conflict here began last October when Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians. Hezbollah soon joined in, firing from Lebanon into Israel. The Shia Islamist armed group and political party - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Britain and the US - said it was acting in support of the Palestinian people. Since October, Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire, causing tens of thousands to flee on both sides of their shared border, and killing more than 500 in Lebanon, most of them fighters.  Israeli officials say 40 people have been killed there – 26 of them soldiers. Fears of a wider conflict were raised at the end of July, when an Israeli strike in Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander. Israel blamed him for the killing of 12 children in a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. It’s already all-out war in Gaza, where Israel has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians at last count, according to figures from the Hamas run  health ministry – data the World Health Organisation regards as credible. Gaza is the main concern for Ayman Sakr. He is fishing alongside Heba, but their views are far apart. The 50-year-old taxi driver insists that if all-out war comes, Lebanon will deal with it. “There is some concern, but we can handle it,“ he tells us. “In the end we will defend ourselves. If we die, that’s ok. ” He is quick to pay tribute to the hundreds of Hezbollah fighters who have been killed by Israel, and to the leader of the armed group. “I salute the resistance and those who were martyred from the bottom of my heart,” he says, “and I salute Hassan Nasrallah who made us and all the Arabs proud. Everyone’s worried about Israel, what about the 39,000 people Israel has killed?”Ayman, who is a father of five, says the horror in Gaza is undeniable, but being ignored. “The whole world sees children, women and the elderly being massacred every day in front of the cameras and nobody notices,” he says. “People’s children are being killed in front of their eyes. Where is the world? Those who are quiet are complicit. ”Hiba still hopes that full scale warfare can be avoided. “No-one has the right to kill anyone,” she says, ”not organisations, not parties and not militias.

3157,2024-08-26 13:39:28.449000+00:00,/news/articles/c4gv4zede8jo,"For almost a month, many here in Lebanon have been on tenterhooks, waiting for Hezbollah to retaliate against Israel. The region was waiting also, wondering if this would be the spark for a wider war. Everyone knew the powerful Iranian-backed group would seek revenge for Israel’s assassination on 30 July of a top military commander, Fuad Shukr. The Israelis managed to hunt him down deep in Hezbollah’s heartland of South Beirut. That was both a strategic loss and a public humiliation. Just hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, in what bore all the hallmarks of another Israeli operation. But Iran continues to signal that its retaliation could be a long-term project. At 05:15 on Sunday, Hezbollah made its move, launching more than 300 Katyusha rockets and “a large number of drones” across the border into Israel. This was revenge served cold. It was carefully calibrated, and it was less than some had expected. Hezbollah said it targeted 11 military bases and barracks, and claimed its attack was a success. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the rockets missed their mark. Either way, Hezbollah did not train its sights on major cities in Israel, or on critical infrastructure. And it did not bring out its big guns. The group - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US - is believed to have more arms than many nations. Israel had got in first, at 04:30, flooding the sky with fighter jets targeting Hezbollah firing positions. The IDF said this “pre-emptive strike"" destroyed thousands of rocket launchers. It was the biggest flare-up here since the Gaza war began last October, after Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel in a single day. Since then, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel across their shared border, showing support for its ally Hamas, and proclaiming solidarity with the people of Gaza. So where are we now, one day on? Surprisingly, perhaps, the Middle East may be a little safer. Both sides have delivered a message, but stopped short of all-out war. And Hezbollah has signalled it’s ready to close the Fuad Shukr chapter - for the moment. “We reserve our right to continue the response at a later point, but for now, the people can be at ease and carry on with their lives,” said Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. After a tense month, that was a welcome message for many here. He was addressing his supporters on TV from an undisclosed location - he might be at the top of Israel’s assassination list. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday’s strikes against Hezbollah were “not the end of the story”. But diplomats told the Reuters news agency that both sides had exchanged messages saying they didn’t want a further escalation. Here in southern Lebanon, there is already a return to the usual low-level conflict. Israel has just attempted another assassination, leaving a burning car on the scorching streets of Sidon, a port city. Local sources say the target was a Hamas leader, who managed to jump out in time. Along the coast in the city of Tyre, Israeli jets are swooping low, breaking the sound barrier - but the beach below is more crowded. “Everything feels calm today,” said a young man in his 20s who did not want to be named. “Everything returned to normal. The streets have been quiet, but people have come back out. Today, people can breathe. ”Hezbollah said it delayed its retaliation to give time for talks on a ceasefire in Gaza. But the latest round of talks in Egypt has ended with no apparent progress. And while the war in Gaza drags on, in all its horror, it is fuelling instability across the Middle East.",Lebanese relief as Hezbollah and Israel seem to step back from brink,Lebanese relief as Hezbollah and Israel seem to step back from brink,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gv4zede8jo,articles/article_3157.txt,results/article_3157.txt.json
3158,2024-10-08 04:07:58.226000+00:00,/news/articles/c70zke9lqjro,"Lebanon’s prime minister at the time of its last war with Israel in 2006 has told the BBC his country has been abandoned by the international community. Fouad Siniora said it was unacceptable to leave Lebanon to fall, and there was a lack of initiative when it came to trying to restore peace. ""We are now in a very difficult situation that requires real effort locally, as well on the Arab side and internationally. ""You can push things - sometimes to the brink of falling - in a major catastrophe without really realising what it means later on. ""It's happening at a time when the American administration is so busy with the elections. ""And we are unable to elect a president, because some groups in the country, particularly Hezbollah, have been insisting that they want a president that will not stab that group in the back,"" Siniora said. The last war between Lebanon and Israel, nearly 20 years ago, began when Hezbollah fighters crossed the border and attacked Israeli soldiers. Two were kidnapped and three were killed, sparking a month-long conflict. In the days that followed, Siniora made a public statement distancing the Lebanese government from what had happened. He thinks the country’s current leaders have failed their people by not doing the same thing. ""This government did not do what my government did that day. My government was very clear and determined in stating that we were not aware, and we were not informed, of Hezbollah’s plan to cross the Blue Line on the border and to kidnap and kill Israeli soldiers. ""This time there hasn't been any move made by the Lebanese government. The advantage of what we did is that we created a distance between the Lebanese government and Lebanon on the one hand, and Hezbollah on the other,"" he explained. Siniora is unflinching in his assessment of Lebanon’s lost sovereignty. ""Practically, Lebanon as a state has been kidnapped by Hezbollah. And behind Hezbollah is Iran. ""This gun that was held by Hezbollah, instead of being pointed towards Israel, started to be pointed domestically and started to be used as a way for Iran to interfere in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen. Lebanon can’t get involved in such a war. ""Siniora was also one of the architects of UN resolution 1701, the agreement which ended the 2006 war. Among its conditions was that a swathe of southern Lebanon - the area south of the landmark Litani river - should be kept as a buffer zone between the two sides, free of any Hezbollah fighters or weapons. Despite the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force Unifil and the presence of the Lebanese army, that didn’t happen. Hezbollah’s people, and its military infrastructure, remained bedded into the area. This vacuum at the top of the Lebanese political system has made Hezbollah’s influence on the country particularly difficult to control. Lebanon has been without a properly functioning government since its last set of elections in 2022, being run instead by a caretaker administration. When President Michel Aoun’s term ended nearly two years ago, lawmakers couldn’t agree on his replacement - so the job remains empty. Many Lebanese believe leadership is in short supply. Siniora is also clear that the conflict in Lebanon should not be inextricably linked to the current year-old war in Gaza. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has visited regional capitals, calling for simultaneous ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza. “Since October 2023 things have been dragging and getting worse and worse. Many chances were made available to dissociate the Lebanese situation from Gaza. It’s very important nationally and from an Arab point of view to associate with Gaza,"" Siniora said. ""But particularly now Lebanon cannot afford, in principle, to get involved in such a matter. ""When the Gaza situation has become 2.2 million Palestinians homeless and all of Gaza destroyed, to continue to link Lebanon's situation with Gaza is not wise.

3159,2024-12-02 20:47:37.459000+00:00,/news/articles/c6273139ed4o,"Deadly Israeli air strikes and a mortar attack by Hezbollah have raised fears that the ceasefire in Lebanon could collapse. Ten people were killed in southern Lebanon on Monday night, the health ministry said, after Israel carried out its biggest wave of air strikes since both sides agreed last week to end 14 months of conflict. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah fighters, launchers and infrastructure and urged Lebanese authorities to prevent what it called the group’s “hostile activity”. Hezbollah had earlier fired two mortars at an Israeli army base in a disputed border area, saying they were a warning over what it saw as “repeated violations” by Israel. No casualties were reported. The US, which along with France brokered the agreement and is monitoring compliance, said that “largely speaking” the ceasefire was holding despite the violence. Under the deal, Hezbollah has been given 60 days to end its armed presence between the Blue Line - the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Israeli forces must withdraw from the area over the same period, and Lebanese army troops and UN peacekeepers are due to deploy there. The conflict began on 8 October 2023, when Hezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Israel launched an intense air campaign and ground invasion against the Iran-backed group in late September, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of 60,000 residents of northern Israel displaced by the rocket attacks. Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people were killed during the hostilities, many of them civilians, and one million others were displaced from areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israeli authorities say more than 80 Israeli soldiers and 47 civilians were killed. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that Israeli warplanes carried out strikes in at least 11 areas of southern Lebanon on Monday night. They included the town of Haris, where the health ministry said six people were killed and two injured. Another four people were killed and one was injured in the town of Tallousseh, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement that it “struck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon”. It also said it hit the Hezbollah launcher in Berghoz that was used to fire two mortars towards the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights. The projectiles fell in an open area and nobody was hurt. “Hezbollah’s launches tonight constitute a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon,” it warned. “The State of Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfil their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah's hostile activity from within Lebanese territory. ”Israel‘s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said it was “determined to continue enforcing the ceasefire and will respond to every Hezbollah violation - minor and major”. Hezbollah confirmed it carried out the mortar attack, saying it was a “defensive and warning response” to what it described as “repeated violations by the Israeli enemy of the ceasefire agreement”. It said they included firing on civilians and conducting air strikes, as well breaches of Lebanese airspace by Israeli aircraft. Earlier on Monday, Lebanese authorities said two people had been killed in Israeli strikes in the south of the country. The health ministry said one person was killed in Marjaoun, where a motorcycle was reportedly targeted, while Lebanese State Security agency said a drone strike killed one of its personnel who was on duty in Nabatieh. The Lebanese army also said a soldier was wounded when a drone targeted an army bulldozer near the north-eastern town of Hermel, in the Bekaa Valley. The Israeli military said it had “operated in southern Lebanon in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”. “We are aware of reports regarding a soldier from the Lebanese military who was injured in one of the strikes and the incident is under investigation,” it added. Lebanese Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who helped negotiate the deal, said: ""The aggressive actions carried out by Israeli occupation forces. . . represent a flagrant violation of the terms of the ceasefire. ”He added that Lebanese authorities had asked the committee formed to monitor enforcement of the ceasefire - comprising the US, France, Israel, Lebanon and the UN peacekeeping force (Unifl) - to declare “where it stands on ongoing violations. . . that have exceeded 54 breaches”. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot meanwhile told his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Saar, in a call that there was a need ""for all sides to respect the ceasefire in Lebanon"", the foreign ministry said. Israeli public broadcaster Kan also reported that US envoy Amos Hochstein had warned Israel over alleged violations. In a video posted online, Saar said: “We hear claims that Israel is violating the ceasefire understandings in Lebanon. On the contrary!”He warned that Israel would take action when armed Hezbollah fighters were identified south of the Litani river or they attempted to move weapons. “Their presence south of the Litani river is the most basic violation of the understandings,” he said. “They must move north immediately. ”“I want to emphasize - Israel is committed to the successful implementation of the ceasefire, but we will not accept a return to the situation as it stood [before the conflict]. ”US officials said the ceasefire had been broadly successful, but there was “a lot more work to do. ”“We’ve gone from dozens of [Israeli] strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “We’re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero. ”",Lebanon ceasefire under strain after Israeli strikes and Hezbollah mortar fire,Lebanon ceasefire under strain after Israeli strikes and Hezbollah mortar fire,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6273139ed4o,articles/article_3159.txt,results/article_3159.txt.json
3160,2024-07-28 14:53:41.115000+00:00,/news/articles/c72vg87rzd5o,"Since October, the near-daily cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon, have killed hundreds of people and forced tens of thousands from their homes on both sides, raising fears that the relatively contained violence could escalate into an all-out conflict. Amid the strikes and counter-strikes, however, there have been indications that they were trying to avoid a major confrontation. But miscalculation was always a risk, and Saturday’s attack on the Druze town of Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, could have been that. Israel accuses Hezbollah of carrying out the strike on a football pitch that killed at least 12 people, including children, the deadliest attack in the current hostilities, and has promised to respond. “Israel will not overlook this murderous attack,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office. “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price which it has not paid up to now. ”Hezbollah denies being behind the attack. Before the scale of the strike became clear, however, the group said it had targeted the Hermon Brigade with an Iranian-made Falaq missile, one of several attacks carried out on that day. The base, on the slopes of Mt Hermon, is about 3km (2miles) from where the explosion happened, raising the possibility that the missile missed its target. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said intelligence information indicated that the attack had been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon, describing the group’s denial as “a lie”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, too, said “every indication” was that the missile had been fired by Hezbollah, and that the US stood by “Israel’s right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks”. Lebanon, then, is waiting for a possible major Israeli reaction. The strikes by Hezbollah started on 8 October, the day after the deadly Hamas attack on Israel, with the group saying they were in support for Palestinians in Gaza. So far, more than 450 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, including about 350 Hezbollah fighters and at least 100 civilians. In Israel, 23 civilians and at least 17 soldiers have been killed. In Lebanon, most of the Israeli attacks have hit the south, where villages are destroyed and deserted, and the eastern Bekaa Valey, two areas where Hezbollah operates. An Israeli campaign targeting places that, so far, have been untouched, including parts of the capital Beirut, could lead to a dangerous and unpredictable phase in their fighting. Seen as a significantly more formidable foe than Hamas, Hezbollah has been preparing for another major conflict with Israel since their last one, in 2006, which inflicted heavy damage on both sides. According to Western estimates, the group has about 150,000 rockets and missiles, which could overwhelm Israel’s sophisticated air defence systems. The arsenal also includes precision guided missiles capable of striking deep into Israeli territory. Israeli authorities have repeatedly described the attacks by the group as unacceptable and are under growing pressure to act to allow the return of displaced residents to northern communities. Military officials have said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which is still carrying out large operations against Hamas in Gaza, is ready to launch an offensive against Hezbollah, although details of what one might involve remain unclear. The latest in Gaza: Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30 - health ministryHassan Nasrallah, the long-time Hezbollah leader, has repeatedly said the group does not want a full-scale war with Israel, but that it was ready for one. Last month, he said the group had deployed only a fraction of its weapons, and warned Israel that any war would be fought “without constraints or rules”. A major operation against the group could lead to the involvement of other Iranian-backed militias in the region that are part of what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance”. Any war would have a devastating impact on both countries, but especially for Lebanon, which has been in a state of permanent crisis for more than half a decade. The economy has collapsed, with 80% of the population estimated to be in poverty, and political disputes have blocked the election of a president for almost two years. The government has limited influence – if any – over Hezbollah, which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others. But a full-scale war is not inevitable. Diplomats were trying to avert a major escalation in hostilities, and the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told the BBC the authorities were “asking Hezbollah not to retaliate”. The Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Oren Marmorstein, said the “only way” to prevent a conflict was to implement the United Nations Resolution 1701, approved to end the 2006 war. The text includes the withdrawal of armed groups from southern Lebanon, between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier with Israel, but was never fully applied. Now, Mr Marmorstein said, was the “very last minute” to prevent a war diplomatically.",Lebanon fears new phase in Hezbollah-Israel fighting,Lebanon fears new phase in Hezbollah-Israel fighting,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c72vg87rzd5o,articles/article_3160.txt,results/article_3160.txt.json
3161,2024-10-05 09:19:27.948000+00:00,/news/articles/c30lj9m300vo,"At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced on Friday that they were suspending work because of Israeli strikes, while a Hezbollah-affiliated health organisation said that 11 paramedics had been killed in the past 24 hours. The four closures capped two weeks of Israeli strikes on hospitals and healthcare workers in Lebanon that have shuttered at least 37 facilities and killed dozens of medical staff, according to the World Health Organisation. Late on Friday night, the Israeli army issued a statement alleging that Hezbollah was using medical vehicles to transport fighters and weapons, warning that it would strike any vehicle it suspected of being used for military purposes. Hospital staff in southern Lebanon told the BBC that health facilities treating wounded civilians had been hit with direct Israeli strikes. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment. Dr Mounes Kalakish, director of the Marjayoun governmental hospital in southern Lebanon, told the BBC that the hospital had no choice but to close on Friday after an airstrike hit two ambulances at the hospital’s entrance way on Friday, killing seven paramedics. “The nurses and doctors were terrified,” he said. “We tried to calm them and carry on working, but it was not possible. ”The emergency director of the hospital, Dr Shoshana Mazraani, said she was sitting at the front of the building when the strike happened. She said that she heard the cries of the paramedics who were hit and ran towards the damaged ambulances, but was warned to stay back by colleagues fearful of a follow up strike. The Marjayoun hospital had already been hanging on by a thread, Dr Mazraani said, with a core team of just 20 doctors remaining from the centre’s usual 120 staff. The closure on Friday was a “tragedy for the region”, she said. “We serve a huge population here, many villages. We had 45 inpatient beds, all now empty. We were the only hospital providing dialysis in the region, for example. We have had to turn away emergency patients and tell others to leave. ”Rita Suleiman, the nursing director at the Saint Therese hospital, on the edge of Beirut’s southern suburbs, told the BBC that the hospital had also struggled on after being badly damaged by a strike on Friday but was later forced to suspend all services. Other hospitals were carrying on with severely limited services. Dr Mohammed Hamadeh, director of the Tebnine hospital, told the BBC on Friday a nearby strike had rocked the building. “The blast was very close,” he said. “We are still trying to operate but we cannot leave the confines of the hospital because it is too dangerous. ” Late on Friday night, the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil announced it had closed after being “violently shelled”, following an order from the Israeli army to evacuate. The Israeli army said it was targeting a mosque adjacent to the hospital which it claimed was being used by Hezbollah fighters. The strikes on healthcare facilities have not been limited to the south of Lebanon. Israel hit a medical centre in central Beirut on Thursday belonging to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation, killing nine and wounding 14. The Israeli army said the strike targeted ""terror assets"". The Lebanese Red Cross said on Thursday that four of its paramedics were wounded in a strike on a convoy evacuating patients, despite the organisation co-ordinating with the Israeli army. Gabriel Karlsson, country manager in Beirut for the British Red Cross, told the BBC: ""Health and aid workers must be able to help those in need without fearing for their own safety. Teams from the Red Cross and Red Crescent are a lifeline, supporting communities tirelessly - they must be protected. ”World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that 28 healthcare workers had been killed in Lebanon over the previous 24 hours, and many other healthcare staff were no longer reporting for work because of the strikes. Dr Kalakish, the director of the Marjayoun hospital, told the BBC that prior to the strike that closed his hospital it was already operating with no anaesthesiologist or other specialists. Some staff had fled the bombardment for their own safety, he said, while others had been prevented from reaching the hospital because of air strikes on nearby roads. Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Thursday that 97 rescue workers had been killed since Hezbollah and Israel began fighting last October. More than 40 of those – paramedics and firefighters – were in just three days this past week, he said.",Lebanon hospitals close as Israeli strikes hit health facilities,Lebanon hospitals close as Israeli strikes hit health facilities,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c30lj9m300vo,articles/article_3161.txt,results/article_3161.txt.json
3162,2024-10-23 23:32:01.519000+00:00,/news/articles/cdxy621qn4eo,"At least 19 people, including six women and five children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, a local official has said. Suad Hammoud told the BBC that the dead included former school principal Ahmed Ezzedine and three generations of his family, who all lived in the three-storey building in the village of Teffahta. The village’s imam, Sheikh Abdo Abo Rayya, was killed while walking near the house at the time of the strike along with two passers-by, she added. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident, but it has repeatedly said it takes measures to mitigate harm to civilians. It has carried out thousands of air strikes across Lebanon over the past four weeks, targeting what it has said are the armed group Hezbollah's operatives, infrastructure and weapons. Ms Hammoud said Wednesday’s strike in Teffahta happened after the funeral for Ahmed Ezzedine’s cousin and brother-in-law, Khodr, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in the neighbouring village of Marwanieh on Monday. But she said a report by the state-run National News Agency (NNA) that the strike had targeted a wake for mourners to express their condolences was incorrect. “Only the house's residents were there. They came back after the funeral. There were no strangers there,” she said. “People are aware that the circumstances do not allow them offering condolences in person, so there are no wakes in the village anymore. ”Also inside the house with Mr Ezzedine were his wife, sister, daughters, daughter-in-law, sons-in-law and his grandchildren, she said. Mr Ezzedine lived on the ground floor, while his children and their families lived on the upper floors. But everyone is believed to have been on the ground floor when the house was hit. A video posted on social media showed shortly afterwards showed a huge plume of smoke rising from a hillside in Teffahta where the house was located, external. On Wednesday morning, Lebanese TV broadcast footage of a pile of rubble and twisted metal that once made up the upper floors, external. The Lebanese health ministry has not reported how many people were killed in the strike. But Ms Hammoud and Teffahta’s community Facebook account, external put the death toll at 19. The Facebook account named the five children as Mohammed Yassin, Ahmed and Malak Ezzedine, and Sara and Mohammed Kinyar, and the six women as Zaineb, Malak, Hadiya, Fadiya and Fatima Ezzedine and Zaina Taleb. Sheikh Abo Rayya was walking near the house at the time of the strike, according to Ms Hammoud. “The houses in the village aren't isolated, they're very close to one another,” she said, adding that another two men identified by the Facebook account as Rabih Younes and Hussein Saleh were also likely to have been passers-by killed by the explosion. A relative of Sheikh Abo Rayya told the BBC that strike happened at about 17:10 local time, about 15 minutes after the funeral. They insisted that the sheikh was not the target, noting that the house had been “obliterated”. “Sheikh Abdo was just passing by the house. He wasn't inside the house. He was on his way to the mosque with his companion. They were going to prayers,” they said. “The imam was going down the hill and the pressure wave blew him away. He didn't die immediately. He was injured and died at the hospital around five hours later. ”Last week, the UN human rights office received reports that 12 women and two children were among 23 people killed in an Israeli air strike on a four-storey residential building in the northern Lebanese town of Aitou. It called for an investigation into the attack, expressing concerns with respect to international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction and proportionality. The Israeli military said it “struck a target belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organisation”. Israel’s launched an air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,900 in the past five weeks, according to the country’s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.

3163,2024-10-21 22:11:57.719000+00:00,/news/articles/c93p3g1v1z4o,"At least 18 people, including four children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike near Lebanon’s largest public hospital in southern Beirut, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Another 60 people were injured when at least three buildings about 50m (160ft) from Rafik Hariri University hospital were destroyed in the Jnah neighbourhood on Monday night. The health ministry said the attack - one of at least 13 reported across the capital - caused “significant damage” to the hospital. The Israeli military said it hit a ""Hezbollah terrorist target"" near the hospital, without giving details, and insisted that the hospital was not targeted or its operation affected. It also accused Hezbollah of systematically embedding its assets among the civilian population - an allegation the armed group has previously denied. The military had warned people to move away from several locations in southern Beirut about 15 minutes before the strike, but the area around hospital was not among them. A BBC producer who was close to the hospital at the time said a loud bang sent people running for cover. Paramedics and firefighters found locals in distress at the scene. On Tuesday morning, rescuers searched the piles of broken concrete and twisted metal, some carrying shovels, others only with their bare hands, at the site of the strike. The location hit was an impoverished and densely populated neighbourhood. At least three multi-storey buildings collapsed and several others were heavily damaged. One of the rescuers said they did not know how many people could be under the rubble. A BBC team saw one body being recovered, while another had been located as they left. One resident said the attack happened after a car arrived in the area, but added that  they could not say who might have been travelling inside.  Videos from elsewhere in southern Beirut, where the Israeli military warned that it was going to target seven locations in advance, showed locals fleeing in vehicles and on foot as the strikes took place. One location identified as a target by the Israeli army was about 400m from Beirut airport, Lebanon’s only functioning commercial airport. Local media shared images of windows blown in by the blast. The Israeli military said aircraft had struck “Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centres, and additional terror targets in Beirut”. “Some of the targets were located underground and included aerial and naval equipment used by Hezbollah to carry out terror attacks,” it added, without identifying the locations. Separately, the Israeli military said it had identified a Hezbollah bunker concealed under Sahel hospital in Haret Hreik, external, which was later evacuated. Military spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said, without providing evidence, that the bunker held hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold that was being used to fund Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. He also said Israel would not strike the hospital itself. Doctors denied the Israeli allegation and took the BBC through the building on Tuesday, including to the first and second level below ground. They insisted there was nothing underneath. “We are an institution helping people,” said Dr Walid Alameh, the hospital’s medical director. “[The hospital] is private. It used to be and will remain. Hopefully, [the Israelis] will believe us. What we are doing is helping people. ” Israel appears to have expanded its war against Hezbollah beyond military infrastructure. On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that they would target the group's financial networks. On Sunday night Israel carried out air strikes targeting branches of a financial association linked with Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital Beirut, as well as the south and east of the country. The Israeli military said it targeted money held by Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), which offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support. Israel and the US accuse AQAH of being a cover for the Iran-backed group to fund its activities. Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif told reporters on Tuesday that AQAH ""had anticipated such an aggression,"" adding that the organisation would fulfil its obligations towards depositors. Also on Monday, US President Joe Biden’s special envoy to the Middle East arrived in Beirut to explore the possibility of a negotiated end to the war. Amos Hochstein said the US wanted to see an end to the war in Lebanon ""as soon as possible"". He warned it was not in Lebanon’s interest to have its future tied to other conflicts in the region, a reference to Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its decision to support Hamas in the Gaza war. He also said the old “status quo” was not sustainable and called for a “comprehensive agreement” that implemented UN Security Council Resolution 1701. The resolution, which ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, called for southern Lebanon to be free of any armed personnel or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state and a UN peacekeeping force. Israel has long complained that this formula failed to prevent Hezbollah from building a formidable military presence in southern Lebanon and firing rockets over the border. As Mr Hochstein spoke, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel, with the Israeli military reporting that 170 projectiles had crossed the border by late Monday. Another 80 projectiles were fired into Israel on Tuesday, according to the military. Four people were injured in the Neot Mordechai area. Israel began an intense air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks.

The strike hit a residential building in Aitou, a predominantly Christian village far from the areas where the Israeli military has carried out thousands of strikes targeting the armed Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. Residents said a family recently displaced by the war had been living there. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reports.

We have proven this recently and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,"" he added. He was speaking during a visit to a military base in northern Israel where a drone launched by the Iran-backed group killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded dozens on Sunday night. The military said it was investigating how the drone evaded its sophisticated air defence systems and hit the Golani Brigade training facility near the town of Binyamina. It was one of Hezbollah’s deadliest attacks on Israel in over a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said it was a response to deadly Israeli attacks in Lebanon, which the country’s health ministry says has killed almost 1,700 people over the past month. Most of the Israeli air strikes over the past week have struck in the majority Shia south and the Bekaa Valley in the east - areas where Hezbollah is strong. Aitou, a Maronite Christian community located in the mountains near the north-western coastal city of Tripoli, was not a place which would have expected to be attacked. ""Oh mother Mary,"" gasped one man as he walked through the devastation wrought on the village. In the smoke and dust, bodies could be seen on the ground. Residents said there was no warning, just a single, massive blast. However, they also said several families displaced by the war in the south had recently moved to Aitou, and that the house which was hit had been rented out to new people just two weeks ago. A Lebanese security source told AFP news agency that the building was ""targeted shortly after a man had arrived in a car"". The Lebanese health ministry said it was carrying out DNA tests to determine the identities of the remains recovered by first responders at the scene. The main focus of Israel's military operations has been in the east, the suburbs of Beirut and the south - where there have been incidents involving UN peacekeepers. On Monday, a spokesperson for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon would not move from any positions, again defying calls by Israel to withdraw. The UN Security Council has expressed strong concern over some UN troops being injured during the Israeli military's offensive against Hezbollah. Also on Monday, the Israeli military said a strike in the southern Nabatieh area had killed the commander of the anti-tank unit of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has not commented on the report. The military also said it had struck Hezbollah launchers used to fire a number of rockets into central and northern Israel on Monday. Most of the rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military. One woman was lightly injured by a barrage of 15 rockets that were fired towards the northern town of Karmiel. Israeli police also said debris from an interception fell in the Holon area, south of Tel Aviv, without causing any injuries or damage. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired around 115 projectiles into Israel on Monday. Early on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel's air force had over the past day struck ""more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers"", in coordination with ground troops. In southern Lebanon, it said it eliminated ""dozens of terrorists"", dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure and located ""vast quantities"" of weapons and equipment.",Lebanon says 21 killed in air strike in country’s north,Lebanon says 21 killed in air strike in country’s north,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y80p1yr9qo,articles/article_3164.txt,results/article_3164.txt.json

Two children were among those killed in strikes which targeted 16 areas in the Baalbek region, officials said. The ministry said 58 people were wounded, adding rescue efforts were still under way in the valley, which is a Hezbollah stronghold. The Israeli military has not yet commented. Israel has carried out thousands of air strikes across Lebanon over the past five weeks, targeting what it says are Hezbollah's operatives, infrastructure and weapons. Governor Bachie Khodr called the attacks the ""most violent"" in the area since Israel escalated the conflict against Hezbollah last month. Unverified video posted on social media showed damage to buildings and forests ablaze, as rescuers searched for the injured. In the town of Boudai, videos on social media appeared to show residents pleading for heavy equipment to be sent to help rescue people believed to be trapped.  The regional head of Baalbek's Civil Defence crews told the BBC that the air strikes were like a ""ring of fire"". 'It was a very violent night,"" Bilal Raad said. ""It was like a ring of fire has suddenly surrounded the area. ""He added the attacks had targeted ""residential quarters where civilians live or near them"", and said a lack of equipment had hampered search and rescue efforts. The town of Al-Allaq was hardest hit with 16 people killed, all from the same family, he said.  Baalbek is home to the ancient Roman ruins of Heliopolis - a UNESCO World Heritage site - where, in Roman times, thousands of pilgrims went to worship three deities. A UNESCO spokesperson said that analysis of satellite images had not revealed any damage within the perimeter of the inscribed site of Baalbek. They added they were ""closely following the impact of the ongoing crisis in Lebanon on the cultural heritage sites"". Earlier on Monday, Israeli air strikes on the coastal city of Tyre left seven dead and 17 injured, Lebanon's health ministry said. Israel issued a warning for people to leave the centre of the city. Hezbollah said it clashed with Israeli troops near Lebanon's southern border on Monday and fired rockets at a naval base inside Israel near Haifa. Cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah broke out after the armed Lebanese group started firing rockets in and around northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. The Lebanese health ministry says more than 2,700 people have been killed and more than 12,400 wounded in Lebanon since then. Israel invaded southern Lebanon in a dramatic escalation on 30 September to destroy, it said, Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”.

""You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah,"" Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said. Lebanon’s health minister said more than 50 people were killed in strikes on Wednesday, which the Israeli military said hit Hezbollah’s intelligence directorate, as well as launchers and weapons stores. Diplomatic efforts are gathering pace to de-escalate the hostilities, with France and the United States proposing a 21-day ceasefire. The remarks by Lt Gen Halevi are the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent. “We keep striking and hitting them everywhere,” he told soldiers from the 7th Brigade taking part in an exercise on Israel’s northern border on Wednesday - in a statement quoted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). “The goal is very clear - to safely return the residents of the north. To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a manoeuvre, which means your military boots. . . will enter enemy territory. ”Lt Gen Halevi said troops would ""destroy the enemy"" and its infrastructure. There was no immediate sign that Israel was poised to enter Lebanon and the US Pentagon said on Wednesday it did not appear ""imminent"". But the IDF chief of staff’s remarks were published shortly after the IDF called up two reserve brigades for ""operational missions in the northern arena”. When a BBC team visited an Israeli border town on Wednesday, the army said that Hezbollah fighters must move well back from the border, to positions north of the Litani River, as demanded by a UN resolution passed in 2006. Israel's allies, including the US, have said they are working to avoid all-out war in the region. Several media reports on Wednesday said senior US officials were attempting to broker a short-term pause in fighting between the two sides. French President Emmanuel Macron met with US President Joe Biden at the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss efforts to secure a ceasefire. Shortly after the talks, France said the two countries were proposing a ""temporary ceasefire"" of 21 days ""to allow for negotiations"". ""There cannot be a war in Lebanon. This is why we urge Israel to cease this escalation in Lebanon and to Hezbollah to cease this missile launch to Israel,"" Mr Macron told the UN. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate ceasefire, and said ""hell is breaking loose"". Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said his country is ""facing a blatant violation of our sovereignty and human rights through the brutal practices of the Israeli enemy"". He added he hoped he could leave the UN session with a ""serious solution"" to ""put pressure on Israel to achieve an immediate ceasefire on all fronts"". Asked by Reuters if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he responded: ""Hopefully, yes. ""Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said it was grateful for diplomatic efforts to avoid escalation but would use ""all use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our aims"". He said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war"", and has made its desire for peace ""clear"". Mr Danon added that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in New York on Thursday, have bilaterial meetings later that day and speak at the General Assembly the following morning. Cross-border fighting continued on Wednesday, with Hezbollah saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency with a missile fired towards Tel Aviv - the first time Hezbollah has targeted the heavily populated area. It was intercepted by air defences and there were no reports of damage or casualties. The launcher was subsequently destroyed in an air strike, the IDF said. IDF spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the missile was heading “towards civilian areas in Tel Aviv”, noting that “the Mossad headquarters is not in that area”. Hezbollah also fired dozens more rockets into northern Israel, injuring two. Meanwhile, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had hit more than 280 “Hezbollah terror targets” in the latest wave of air strikes on Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that the strikes had killed at least 51 people and injured 223, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. The health ministry reported deadly Israeli attacks in southern areas including Joun, in the Chouf mountains near the southern city of Sidon, as well as Maaysrah, in another mountainous area north of Beirut, and in the north of the Bekaa Valley. More than 600 people have been reported killed across Lebanon since Monday, when Israel began an intense air campaign to destroy what it said was infrastructure built up by Hezbollah since they last fought a war in 2006. Another 90,000 people in Lebanon have been newly displaced, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes before the escalation, according to the UN. Almost 40,000 are living in shelters across the country. Nearly a year of deadly cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza has also displaced around 70,000 people in northern Israel, whose safe return the Israeli government and military say they want to ensure. Hezbollah says it is attacking Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, Hamas, and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. It comes after an unprecedented wave of attacks on Hezbollah. Last week, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members to communicate exploded in two waves across Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for the attacks. Then, an Israeli air strike on Friday on the group’s stronghold of Dahieh, in southern Beirut, essentially wiped out the chain of command of its main fighting unit, the Radwan Force. The group confirmed that one of its top military leaders, Ibrahim Aqil, was among 55 people killed.",Lebanon strikes are preparing for ground offensive - Israel army chief,Lebanon strikes are preparing for ground offensive - Israel army chief,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xe8nkj9wyo,articles/article_3168.txt,results/article_3168.txt.json
3169,2024-10-24 23:19:17.694000+00:00,/news/articles/crr9l4l0xx4o,"When the air strike hit on Monday night, Fouad Hassan, 74, was sitting on his balcony in south Beirut’s Jnah neighbourhood, reading his phone. No evacuation order was given by the Israeli army before the rocket slammed into the home of his children and grandchildren a short walk away. “When the bombing happened, I fainted,” Fouad says. “I was taken to get oxygen due to the smoke from the strike. When I got better, I realised that the entire neighbourhood was devastated. ”Now a pile of mangled steel and masonry lies where a number of residential buildings stood closely together. Where buildings are still standing, people's possessions can be seen inside through holes blasted in the walls. A digger and about 40 local men are doing the slow work to excavate and look for bodies under the rubble. “Look at the destruction - a whole neighbourhood wiped out, the people here dead,” Fouad says, gesturing over the bomb site. “My granddaughter died here, and my grandson is still in a coma. Both were 23 years old. ”Fouad is a well-known figure in the community. An actor and comedian, he has appeared on Lebanese television and is known by his stage name Zaghloul. As we walk around the bomb site, locals come to shake Fouad’s hand and offer words of condolence. Taking his phone from his pocket, Fouad shows us a picture of his granddaughter, Alaa. She looks confident, posing for the camera and wearing a smart gold dress. “She was happily engaged, looking forward to getting married in three months,” Fouad says. “She applied to be Miss Lebanon and was shredded to pieces. Why? Why does the world allow this?” Since Israel began escalating its air strikes against Hezbollah in September, rockets have hit across the length and breadth of the country. It is a military campaign that Israel’s leaders feel has brought them huge wins so far - having claimed the lives of Hezbollah’s senior leadership. However it is also a campaign that has taken many innocent lives, with numerous reports of entire families being killed in strikes around the country. Over 1,900 Lebanese people have been killed, according to government figures, since Israel stepped up the air strikes. The statistics do not differentiate between Hezbollah fighters and civilians. Despite issuing no evacuation order to residents in advance on Monday night, the Israeli army subsequently stated that they were aiming for a “Hezbollah terrorist target”, but did not elaborate further. First reports coming from the scene suggested that the compound of the Rafik Hariri hospital, the capital’s largest public hospital, had been struck, which the Israeli army denied. The damage to the hospital is superficial, but across a road littered with parked cars that have their windows blown out, lies a poor neighbourhood that was hit. Fouad’s son, Ahmed joins us. He shows us a picture of his son who lies in intensive care in the hospital, his face bandaged and bloody. “This was my house; it’s gone now, just like everything else. We have no place to go and no clothes. This is a massacre. We have no base here, no Hezbollah, there’s nothing,” Ahmed tells us. It is not clear why its army chooses to issue evacuation orders before some missile strikes and not others - but when Israel does strike without warning in a dense residential area, the human cost can be indiscriminate and high. Fouad tells us of playing with the young children in the neighbourhood who were killed in the strike. “Whenever I entered the neighbourhood, they would shout, 'Grandpa, Grandpa! What did you bring us?' I would give them candies, crisps, and popcorn. Their loss fills me with sorrow; they all died. Their mother is still trapped under the rubble with one of her children. ”As we begin to leave the site, a hush falls over those gathered and we see a stretcher carrying a wrapped body being taken away by the digger. We are told that a mother was found next to a child.",Lebanon: 'Whole neighbourhood wiped out' in Israel air strike,Lebanon: 'Whole neighbourhood wiped out' in Israel air strike,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crr9l4l0xx4o,articles/article_3169.txt,results/article_3169.txt.json
3170,2024-10-24 10:25:01.457000+00:00,/news/articles/cvgx3zjvjg3o,"Israel's intensified bombing campaign of Lebanon has caused more damage to buildings in two weeks than occurred during a year of cross-border fighting with Hezbollah, according to satellite-based radar data assessed by the BBC. Data shows that more than 3,600 buildings in Lebanon appear to have been damaged or destroyed between 2 and 14 October 2024. This represents about 54% of the total estimated damage since cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah broke out just over a year ago. The damage data was gathered by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. They compared radar satellite images to reveal sudden changes in the height or structure of buildings which indicate damage. Wim Zwijnenburg, an environmental expert from the Pax for Peace organisation, reviewed the satellite-based radar data and warned of the impact of Israel’s bombing. “The Israeli military campaign seems to be creating a ‘dead zone’ in the south of Lebanon to drive out the population, and making it difficult for Hezbollah to re-establish positions, at the cost of the civilian population,” he said. Cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah broke out after the armed Lebanese group started firing rockets in and around northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Israel invaded southern Lebanon in a dramatic escalation on 30 September to destroy, it said, Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Satellite photos, radar imagery, and military records show recent Israeli bombardment in Lebanon has focused on the southern border region. It has also expanded to central and northern areas, including the Bekaa Valley and Beirut's southern suburbs. The Israeli army said it hit thousands of Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut. Most of the strikes on Beirut have targeted Dahieh, a southern suburb that is home to thousands of civilians. The Israeli military claims the area is home to Hezbollah’s command headquarters. A series of Israeli strikes on buildings in the area killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah on 27 September. Separate data from the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), which has been analysed by the BBC, indicates at least 2,700 attacks by the Israeli military on Lebanese areas from 1 September until 11 October 2024. While these attacks primarily focus on southern border areas, they have also extended to northern and central regions. Each Israeli attack can also include several bombings. Hezbollah has carried out around 540 attacks against Israel in the same timeframe, according to Acled. Each Hezbollah attack can include a barrage of rockets, missiles and drones. The Israeli military says air strikes in Lebanon are targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. It regularly adds it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by attacks from the Iran-backed group. About 60,000 people have been evacuated from northern Israel because of near-daily attacks by Hezbollah. But some rockets have reached further south and damaged homes in and around the coastal city of Haifa. Hezbollah reiterated it would continue sending rockets into Israel unless a ceasefire is reached. The group’s deputy secretary general claimed rockets would focus on military targets, but warned Hezbollah had the right to attack anywhere in Israel in response to strikes across Lebanon. On the Lebanese side, many Israeli air strikes targeted the city of Tyre, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut, according to the BBC’s analysis of the latest monthly data collected by Acled. Lebanon's government says up to 1.3 million people have been internally displaced, whilst Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned of the ""largest displacement” in the country's history. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been issuing evacuation orders to residents across the country, including areas of Beirut. In the south, the army instructed residents of several villages to leave their homes and ""immediately head north of the Awali River,"" which meets the coast about 50 km (30 miles) from the Israeli border. “This is a humanitarian catastrophe,” Gabriel Karlsson, Middle East Manager at the British Red Cross in Beirut, told the BBC. He said there are insufficient shelters to accommodate so many evacuees. “I saw children sleeping in the streets,” Karlsson added, urging humanitarian organisations to coordinate their efforts to address the escalating crisis. Lebanese officials say at least 2,350 have been killed and over 10,000 injured in Israeli attacks. The Lebanon health minister said many casualties were civilians. On the Israeli side, 60 people have been killed and more than 570 wounded by Hezbollah attacks, Israeli authorities say. “Collateral damage is inevitable in war”, Amos Yadlin, the former head of Israeli military intelligence, told the BBC. The retired major-general blamed Hezbollah for the war and claimed Israel’s ground offensive would force the group out from the border areas. Zwijnenburg, from the Pax for Peace organisation, however, has warned of the impact of Israel’s military campaign on civilians and the populated areas. “The heavy blast radius kills and maims civilians nearby”, he said, in reference to Israeli air strikes. “Open-source data combined with satellite imagery also showed that civilian infrastructure such as irrigation channels, gas stations and electricity grids were damaged, which is worsening the humanitarian situation,” he added.

3171,2024-10-15 08:35:57.215000+00:00,/news/articles/cj31gkg6vngo,"The Israeli military has been hitting search-and-rescue teams, medical centres and hospitals across Lebanon since it escalated its offensive against Hezbollah last month. The attacks have killed and injured dozens of medics and emergency workers and have left swathes of the south cut off from emergency services and healthcare. One organisation has been hit more than any other. The Islamic Health Society (IHS), funded by Hezbollah, operates emergency services, hospitals and medical centres across the country. As of Friday, more than 85 of its staff had been killed, and more than 150 wounded, according to Bilal Assaf, head of media relations at the IHS Civil Defence. Just after midnight on 7 October, Israel struck the Baraachit Emergency Centre in the southern Bint Jbeil region, killing at least 10 firefighters, according to the Lebanese health ministry. In the hours before the attack, the firefighters in Baraachit - part of the IHS Civil Defence emergency services - were grappling with a grim dilemma. There were still civilians in the area – including some who refused to leave - but Israeli forces were no longer allowing the team to conduct missions. “Every time they went out, they would hit near their vehicle,” says Mr Assaf. The firefighters decided to split up; some would head north to Nabatiyeh, and others would stay and reassess whether to relocate in the morning. “Unfortunately, they didn’t live to see the next morning,” Mr Assaf says. In the early hours of Monday, an Israeli air strike destroyed the building where they were staying. The Lebanese health ministry denounced the strike as a “massacre”. In a statement, it said: “The Israeli enemy has added to its rich record a new war crime against firefighters and rescue workers in south Lebanon, displaying unmatched violence and lack of humanity, targeting people engaged in purely humanitarian search and rescue missions. ”A few hours after the attack, the Lebanese Red Cross went to the site and found eight bodies. There were more under the rubble, but it could not remove them because search and rescue teams could not make it to the site, according to Mr Assaf. Days after the attack, he tells me, the remains of several firefighters are still under the debris. As Lebanon struggles with a mass displacement crisis caused by Israeli strikes across large parts of the country, IHS medics and volunteers are offering support to the people affected – alongside the government and other organisations. In one of many schools in Beirut which have become shelters, hundreds of people who have fled Israeli bombing on the south and the southern suburbs of Beirut try to make themselves at home. Clothes hang out to dry from the windows of the classrooms overlooking the playground; faces - some bored, some curious - take the occasional glance at the scene unfolding below and disappear back to their bedrooms. Down in the schoolyard, children play around, some with bicycles, others with footballs. A few young men gather around our camera, complaining about water shortages. Some of the adults take drags on their shishas, a popular pastime suited for a long and uncertain wait. Overhead, the constant hum of an Israeli drone - a new normal all over Beirut. Ali Freidi, who runs the health centres of the IHS, tells me they have deployed doctors, nurses, therapists and psychiatrists to help the growing mass of displaced people. He acknowledges the immense pressure the IHS's services were under, both in dealing with the growing needs of the displaced, as well as Israel’s strikes on their colleagues in the emergency services. “We are part of the fabric of society,” he says. “Everyone knows someone who was martyred. ”Batoul Hammoud, 25, is a school teacher and a volunteer with the IHS Civil Defence. She says she and her fellow volunteers have been going around the school - and another one across the street - to try to figure out how they can help. “The most pressing need is medicine. Many people left their homes without taking their medicine. ”The IHS offers routine daily services, such as monitoring the blood pressure of the many elderly among the displaced, she says. “As a teacher, I can also offer some psychological support for the kids, organise some activities, or just talk to them and calm them down. ” The IHS emerged in the early 1980s; amidst a civil war, an Israeli occupation of the south, and a breakdown of the state across Lebanon. It was later licensed by the government, and currently operates in co-ordination with the Ministry of Health. It also has agreements with municipalities to run medical centres and emergency services. As the health service comes under intense fire across the country, it has taken more hits than any other health organisation. On 3 October, Israel struck a centre belonging to the IHS in the heart of Beirut, killing nine people and wounding 14.  Most of those killed were civil defence workers and paramedics, who were just back from a search-and-rescue mission in the southern suburbs, where there had been heavy Israeli bombardment. The next day, seven medics were killed in an Israeli air strike on two IHS ambulances near the entrance to Marjaiyoun hospital, in the south of the country. The hospital went out of service on that day. Also that day Israeli forces struck the IHS-run Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, wounding several doctors and hospital staff. The hospital suspended operations following the attack. The director of the hospital, Dr Mohamad Sleiman, told me the hospital was functioning well until the last day, despite the war raging around it. “We had medicine and equipment. The government plan was working well. We had no shortages the day of the accident. We just need safety,” he said. The Israeli military has issued several statements accusing Hezbollah of using medical vehicles to transport fighters and weapons. It described its attack on the Baarachit Emergency Centre as a “precise, intelligence-based strike on several Hezbollah terrorist operatives who were using a fire station as a military post during combat”. It also accused Hezbollah of “systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure”. It said the strike on the HIS centre in central Beirut targeted “terror assets”. And on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesman claimed that it had “discovered lately that Hezbollah elements are using ambulances to transport saboteurs and weapons”, and threatened it would take “the necessary measures against any vehicle transporting gunmen”, regardless of what type of vehicle it is. Following the attack on the medical centre in Beirut, the EU’s foreign policy chief said: “Not only civilians are victims of attacks, including in densely populated areas, but they are deprived of emergency care. I condemn this violation [of International Humanitarian Law]. ” Mr Assaf, the spokesman for the IHS Civil Defence, says the IHS plays no military role and accuses Israel of striking emergency services in areas where they want to force civilians out. “Up until two weeks ago there were still some people in Bint Jbeil,” he says. “Our presence reassured them to a certain extent. Our guys were taking care of them, even bringing them food. ”“Let’s assume for the sake of argument they’ve seen something with us [weapons], why are they hitting other emergency services?On Friday, the UN said that over 100 medics and emergency workers had been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel one year ago. The World Health Organization said that since September 17, there had been 18 attacks on health facilities in Lebanon, killing 72 health workers. The Lebanese health ministry has said that among the teams hit are the Islamic Risala Scout Association affiliated to the Amal party, an ally of Hezbollah, as well as the Lebanese Red Cross, and Lebanon’s official Civil Defence service, which is run by the interior ministry. With the escalating attacks on emergency services, as well as the buildings housing the displaced, and crowded neighbourhoods in Beirut, many now see parallels between Israel’s onslaught in Lebanon and its year-long military campaign in Gaza. Last week, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel was perpetrating “a concerted policy to destroy Gaza’s healthcare system”. It accused Israel of “committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities”. Israel rejected the commission’s findings. While the carnage in Lebanon is still far from what Palestinians in Gaza have endured, many here fear it is only the beginning. Among the IHS staff and volunteers, there is a mix of pain and defiance as they struggle to do their jobs under fire. “At night when we gather to eat, we look at each other, wondering who among us won’t be here tomorrow,” Mr Assaf says. I ask if he thinks they might have to suspend their operations in case the Israelis keep hitting them. “They will definitely keep hitting us. We will definitely never stop. ”Mr Freidi, who runs the IHS medical centres, insists they “won’t leave the people”. “These are our people who were forced to leave their land. We will serve them till our last breath. ”Ms Hammoud, the teacher and IHS volunteer, echoes these sentiments. “It’s very hard, the targeting of these people who are helping others. These people should not be targeted. ”“What God decrees will happen,” she says with a smile. “If God grants us martyrdom, then praise be to God. We will die as martyrs of the Civil Defence of the Islamic Health Society. ”",Lebanon’s emergency workers pay a deadly price amid Israeli bombing,Lebanon’s emergency workers pay a deadly price amid Israeli bombing,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj31gkg6vngo,articles/article_3171.txt,results/article_3171.txt.json

Iqbal Mohamed, the newly elected MP for Dewsbury and Batley, made his appeal in the Commons chamber on Tuesday. During the speech he criticised the ""double standards"" of some politicians condemning Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, but then going on to ""defend the most heinous crimes of Israel"". Mohamed added the ""ongoing genocide"" had been a ""huge factor"" in his election to Parliament back in July’s General Election. He said: ""When the Prime Minister endorsed the rights of the Israeli government to cut off water and electricity to the people of Gaza, people in Dewsbury and Batley said, 'No, not in our name'. ""Mohamed was one of four pro-Palestinian Independent MPs who were elected after beating Labour MPs over the party's response to the crisis in the Middle East, which escalated last October when Hamas attacked Israel. He has since joined Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan and Adnan Hussain in forming a parliamentary group headed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mohamed went on to say in his speech that ""most British people want an immediate ceasefire"" and ""an end to the UK's complicity"". He said: ""They are sick and tired of the double standards, with politicians lining up to condemn and sanction Russian aggression in Ukraine, yet defend the most heinous crimes of Israel. ""The compassion for Palestinian lives is not inversely proportional to the compassion for Israeli lives or vice versa. ""All lives are equal, and our compassion must also be equal. ”He also called on the government to ""halt the genocide and to end the 76-year-old, long unlawful occupation"". Opening his speech, Mohamed spoke of his pride in being ""the second local, born and bred MP for Dewsbury"" and the ""eldest of six children born to Gujarati Indian immigrants"". He also recalled when as a child he said he asked God to make him one of two things, either a parliamentarian or a Blue Peter presenter. He added that ""if a Blue Peter producer is watching I'm still available for a guest appearance or a Christmas special"".

Macron told France Inter radio that ""the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza"". At a summit in Paris, the French president reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza continuing despite ceasefire calls, and he also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon. Netanyahu quickly pushed back but during a telephone call between the two leaders on Sunday, Macron reiterated France's ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel. In a video earlier released by his office, Netanyahu said ""Israel will win with orwithout their support"", adding that calling for an arms embargo was ""a disgrace"". ""Shame on them,"" he said, referring to Macron and other Western leaders who have called for what he described as an arms embargo on Israel. Macron, in an interview with the French broadcaster which was recorded on Tuesday and aired on Saturday, said ""France is not delivering any"" weapons to Israel. He added: ""I think we are not being heard. """"I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,"" he said, adding that the conflict was leading to ""hatred"". Macron also said that avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a ""priority"" and that ""Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza"". Netanyahu's office responded by saying that any country that did not stand with Israel was supporting Iran and its allies and proxies. Netanyahu said: ""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. ""Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them. ""Macron's office later said that France is a ""steadfast friend of Israel"", adding that Netanyahu's reaction was ""excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel"". Speaking in Paris on Saturday, Macron said that while both the US and France had called for a ceasefire in Lebanon, he added: ""I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil. ""However, Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza on Monday. During a telephone conversation on Sunday, Netanyahu told the French President that Israel's fight against the Hezbollah group would help ""change the reality"" in Lebanon and bring stability to the entire Middle East, a statement from his office said. “Israel’s friends are expected to stand behind it, and not impose restrictions on it that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil,” Netanyahu was reported to have said during their call. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his country's ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel's security, according to his office. Monday will mark the first anniversary of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.

Mason told the BBC: “We don’t tend to say that the bombing of German cities was genocide, we don’t tend to say that Hiroshima was genocide – these were acts of war, maybe disproportionate. “Genocide is a very serious word,” he added. “To just mix up the words genocide and war is not accurate. ” The SNP Member Conduct Committee, which ruled that Mason should be expelled, accused Mason of claiming to be the “arbiter” of what is considered to be genocide, describing that as “unacceptable and offensive”.

Mason denied was was claiming to be the “arbiter” of what was genocide and called for the party to be “tolerant” on such issues. He said the SNP should be a “big tent”, adding: “On issues like this that are not central to independence, we should allow a bit of latitude so that no one person is the arbiter of a word like genocide. ”The Shettleston MSP said he supported the party in calling for a two-state solution the conflict, but said he did not understand the party policy he is accused of disagreeing with.

The move comes days after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson was pictured standing alongside Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela GrudskyMany SNP figures are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East and the diplomatic encounter prompted an internal backlash. Mr Mason said he was ""disappointed"" by his suspension, which came after he wrote on X that the country's actions in Gaza did not amount to ""genocide"". In response, a spokesperson for the SNP Chief Whip said: ""To flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable. ""There can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance. ""The spokesperson added the SNP Group would now meet to discuss the matter, with a recommendation of a fixed period suspension, for what they described as a ""utterly abhorrent comment"". The withdrawal of the whip means Mr Mason is effectively expelled from the SNP with immediate effect and must sit as an independent MSP until it is restored. Following the move the Glasgow Shettleston MSP posted a statement on Facebook which outlined his desire for peace in the region. The statement acknowledged ""too many"" lives had been lost and that ""many people feel that Israel has moved from a position of self-defence to seeking revenge"". Mr Mason added: ""However, I personally do not believe that Israel has tried to commit, has committed, or is committing genocide.  ""They certainly have the ability to kill many more Palestinians than they have done. That is not to say that the loss of life already is not too many.  ""And we should remember that it is Iran and Hamas who have stated that they want Israel wiped off the map… that sounds more like an intention of genocide than anything Israel has said or done. ""On Wednesday Scotland's First Minister John Swinney defended Mr Robertson's face-to-face meeting with the deputy ambassador, which took place on 8 August. A spokesperson said Mr Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides in Gaza”. They added that the external affairs secretary had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza. ”But former minister Kevin Stewart branded the meeting a mistake. The Aberdeen Central MSP posted on social media, external, external: “I hope Angus Robertson also demanded an immediate ceasefire, castigated the IDF for bombing hospitals and schools and told you that Israel should comply with all of the UN Resolutions that have been passed over decades”. That was reposted by Ivan McKee, a serving Scottish government minister. John Swinney posted a statement online, external, acknowledging that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”. But he stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. The first minister explained that he saw it as an opportunity to convey the Scottish government’s “consistent position on the killing and suffering of innocent civilians in the region. ”Mr Mason also met with Ms Grudsky and said they had a ""useful discussion about what Israel hopes to achieve in Gaza"". He added: ""As UK learned in Ireland, to achieve peace we must talk to each other. . . including to people we disagree with. ""The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.

3178,2024-10-03 20:57:33.891000+00:00,/news/articles/c17lpydd842o,"Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah. The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. Plumes of smoke could be seen over the city on Friday morning. US outlets citing Israeli officials reported the target was Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine has been widely regarded as the most likely candidate to replace Nasrallah after his death in an Israeli strike last week. Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks in the last 24 hours while 151 others had been wounded. Elsewhere, the Lebanese army said two of its soldiers had been killed in the country's south as Israeli forces pressed on with their invasion against Hezbollah and ordered another 20 towns and villages to evacuate. The Israeli military has not commented, but did say its troops had killed Hezbollah fighters near the border. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli troops on both sides of the frontier. The two fatal attacks on the Lebanese army soldiers were just hours apart on Thursday, the third full day of the invasion. In the first incident, the army said, one soldier was killed and another was wounded “as a result of an aggression by the Israeli enemy during an evacuation and rescue operation with the Lebanese Red Cross in Taybeh village"". The Red Cross said four of its volunteers were also lightly wounded, and that their movements had been co-ordinated with UN peacekeepers. The army said that in the second incident another soldier was killed “after the Israeli enemy targeted an army post in the Bint Jbeil area”. “The personnel at the post responded to the sources of fire,” the Lebanese army added, marking a rare involvement in a conflict in which it has not engaged. The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety. Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border. Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006. Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”. “There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. And there's a striking number of people who are displaced around the city. ”“There are these cars everywhere that are from people that have fled the fighting in the south of the country and the southern suburbs. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside. ”Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15. Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. A civil defence agency linked to Hezbollah also said seven of its first responders were among nine people killed in the strike. Lebanon’s health minister later said more than 40 paramedics and firefighters had been killed by Israeli fire in the past three days. The Israeli Air Force carried out air strikes during Thursday against targets it said belonged to Hezbollah including the group's intelligence headquarters, weapons production sites, weapons storage facilities. Two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks targeting Hezbollah have killed more than 1,300 people across Lebanon and displaced more than one million, according to local authorities. Israel went on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist military, political and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. The IDF also announced on Thursday that its aircraft had struck 200 Hezbollah “terrorist targets” in southern Lebanon and elsewhere overnight, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. About 15 Hezbollah fighters were killed when the municipality building in Bint Jbeil was hit, it said. Later, it said a structure housing three Hezbollah commanders had been destroyed during a joint operation carried out by the air force and infantry. Hezbollah said on Thursday evening that its fighters had “repelled failed attempts” by Israeli commandos to advance into some border villages during the day. The group also said it had targeted “enemy gatherings” and homes on the other side of the frontier, while also continuing to fire rockets deep into northern Israel. The IDF said more than 230 projectiles had been launched into Israeli territory over the course of the day. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, and there were no casualty reports. The communities sitting along Israel’s northern border fence are now a closed military zone. Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil. He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead. “We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war. “But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?”“It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes. ”",Massive blasts in Beirut after renewed Israeli air strikes,Massive blasts in Beirut after renewed Israeli air strikes,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17lpydd842o,articles/article_3178.txt,results/article_3178.txt.json
3179,2024-10-16 17:11:12.294000+00:00,/news/articles/cy43z81nnvlo,"The UN’s special coordinator for Lebanon has criticised Israel after air strikes on municipal buildings in the southern city of Nabatieh killed the mayor and 15 other people. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called the killing of mayor Ahmad Kahil “alarming” and said any violations of international humanitarian law were “completely unacceptable”. At least five of those killed in Wednesday's strike were municipal staff co-ordinating aid for civilians remaining in the area, Nabatiyeh Governor Howaida Turk told the BBC. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying it had ""intentionally"" targeted a council meeting. The attack was the most significant against a Lebanese state building since the latest escalation in fighting, which began about two weeks ago, and has raised concerns about the safety of the country’s state infrastructure. A spokesman for the Israeli military said its forces had launched raids targeting dozens of Hezbollah targets in the area and destroyed a tunnel used by the Iran-backed group. ""We know that Hezbollah many times takes advantage of civilian facilities,"" Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said at a meeting of the UN in New York City on Wednesday. Turk, the governor, said that while the majority of Nabatieh residents had already left the area following heavy Israeli air strikes, the mayor and other municipal employees had stayed behind to help those who remained. “This is just like strikes all over Lebanon,” she said. “They [Israel] have hit civilians, Red Cross, civil defence. Now they have targeted a government building. It is unacceptable. It is a massacre. ”Previous strikes on Nabatieh over the past few days have destroyed historic buildings, including an Ottoman-era market dating to 1910. Israel also launched at least one air strike against Beirut on Wednesday. The strike, which hit the southern suburb of Dahieh, was the first on the Lebanese capital in five days. It came after a reported intervention by the US in which it urged restraint over the bombing of the capital. Residents of Dahieh had begun to return to the area over the past few days, taking advantage of the apparent pause in bombing to check on their homes and retrieve clothes and other possessions. Several told the BBC on Wednesday that the area resembled a ghost town, with rubble and debris from buildings littering the streets. The strike on Dahieh came just hours after a US state department spokesman Matthew Miller publicly expressed concern over the “scope and nature” of Israel’s bombing of Beirut. Mr Miller said the state department’s concerns had been ""made clear to the government of Israel"". An Israeli military spokesman said that prior to striking Beirut, “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including advancing warnings to the population in the area”. Israel has faced criticism this week over its warnings, which Amnesty International has called “inadequate” and “misleading”. The human rights charity said the warnings did “not absolve Israel of its obligations under international humanitarian law”. Israel has expanded its air campaign in recent days, launching an unexpected strike in the far north of the country on Monday. The strike, which destroyed a large residential home that had been rented by a displaced family in the Christian village of Aitou, killed 23 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Twelve of the dead were women and two children, the ministry said. The UN human rights office called for an investigation into the Aitou strike, saying it raised ""real concerns"" with respect to international humanitarian law.",Mayor and 15 others killed in Israeli strike on Lebanon council meeting,Mayor and 15 others killed in Israeli strike on Lebanon council meeting,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy43z81nnvlo,articles/article_3179.txt,results/article_3179.txt.json

Dr Matt Newport, who is from Ramsbottom and works at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, has been in the war-torn region three times this year with charity UK-Med. He said that 40% of the ""dramatically injured patients"" UK-Med field hospitals received were children.   Dr Newport said the experience had made him hug his daughter ""that little bit tighter"". The anaesthetist said he regularly encountered gunshot wounds and lost limbs. ""It’s the huge number of wounded children and women that has left a real impact on me - right down to babies just a day or two old and weighing just a couple of kilograms,"" he said. ""As a first-time father of a two-year-old, seeing displaced, frightened, parentless, and traumatically injured children has been quite challenging,"" he added. He and his colleagues often found themselves working to the sound of gunfire and explosions. Dr Newport, 37, said the conflict ""needs to come to an end"", with ""civilians coming to harm through no fault of their own on both sides"". He spoke of ""huge issues"" getting medical supplies across the border and ""running the gauntlet"" of organised criminal gangs with assault rifles. He said that working in Gaza had made him reflect on how grateful he was for the NHS. “Returning to the NHS, I have any bit of equipment and medication I need at the drop of a hat and it makes me really sad that the excellent Palestinian medics I worked with often don’t have the most basic resources through no fault of their own,"" said Dr NewportThe medic said he planned to ""keep going back and doing what I can"", adding that he felt it important to show his daughter how important it was to do such humanitarian work. The UK-Med charity is part of the UK Government’s humanitarian response to the Israel/Gaza crisis. A UK-Med spokesperson said the charity was now running two Foreign Office-funded field hospitals based in Al Mawasi and Deir El Balah, which have treated more than 100,000 patients in Gaza so far. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza estimates that more than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since conflict broke out following the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel has consistently questioned the credibility of the information. In May, the Foreign Minister Israel Katz described it as ""fake data from a terrorist organisation"".

Speaking to the authors of a report by the Policy Exchange, external think tank in May, Matt Twist said this was true ""particularly in the early stages in October"". Asked to comment on the report by the BBC, he said that ""months of protests have had a cumulative impact on London and its communities"". Palestine-related protests in London between October 2023 and June have cost the Metropolitan Police almost £43m and needed almost 52,000 officers, according to its own estimates as revealed by the London Assembly, external. The right-wing think tank said its report revealed the impact of ""a new era of increasingly disruptive protests"" on public service finances, public tourism and retail. Mr Twist said a ""significant demand"" had been placed on the Met, adding: ""Each event presents a policing challenge and requires a substantial amount of planning and resource. ""Our priority has always been to keep people safe, balancing the lawful right to protest with the impact on the wider community. ""The Policy Exchange report said that current legislation required protest organisers only to provide six days' notice to the police of their intention to stage a march. As a result, final plans for the event were often only provided to the public the day before, or on the day of a march, which was ""simply unreasonable for the public to be required to continually adapt"", the report said. It also found that in nearly a third of cases, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) chose not to prosecute suspects in public order cases based on ""public interest"" grounds. Speaking to the think tank in May, Mr Twist told it that the protests represented a ""very real policing challenge"". He added: ""On occasion we did not move quickly to make arrests, for example the man chanting for 'jihad' which was a decision made following fast-time advice from lawyers and the CPS. ""He told the Policy Exchange that the force was now ""much more focused on identifying reasonable grounds for arrest"". There have been frequent protests across the UK since October. These include marches organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) that called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, as well as environmental campaigns by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. After three young girls were killed in an attack in Southport on 29 July, many protests also descended into rioting and disorder. For its report, the Policy Exchange conducted a nationwide poll of more than 1,500 adults. It found that more than two thirds of respondents would drop plans to travel with small children or an elderly or mobility-impaired friend or relative on the day of a major protest in a nearby city or town. More than 60% said they would abandon plans to visit a tourist attraction and more than half would cancel plans to go shopping. The Policy Exchange's report made 26 recommendations, among them a call on the government to change the criteria to prohibit a protest march under section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986 to include assessing the potential for ""serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". It also called for a Protest Commission for London to be established and appointed by the home secretary. The Met should impose ""more stringent"" conditions on protest marches, the report also recommended. Former Met Commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe, who endorsed the report, said: ""In recent years the policing of protest has become increasingly challenging for police commanders and officers on the ground. ""We regularly see police officers demonstrating conspicuous courage and for that they deserve our gratitude and respect.

3183,2024-09-20 21:57:20.545000+00:00,/news/articles/c8xejx07exro,"At the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan, four Arabic language TV news channels are beaming in images of the war in Gaza and the aftermath of the recent  pager and radio devices explosions in Lebanon. The smell of cardamom-infused coffee and shawarma and falafel, and hum of friends catching up, stand in stark contrast to the images on the television screens. Dearborn is the first Arab-majority city in the US, and it has served as a key centre for the ""uncommitted"" movement that is opposed to the Biden administration's policy toward the Middle East. Because they are in Michigan - a key Midwestern swing state that Joe Biden won by fewer than three points in 2020 - Dearborn voters, like those who frequent the Sahara Restaurant, could decide Kamala Harris's political future. Sam Hammoud, whose family has run the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn for the past 30 years, said that taxes and inflation have negatively affected his business - but it's not what is motivating his vote. He is currently an undecided voter. “It’s about the situation in our homelands,” he said. “We need a ceasefire. There is no ceasefire. We have no more words,” he added. Mr Hammoud's feelings are shared by many here, and the Arab-American community has been sounding the alarm bell to Democrats for months, warning the party that its loyal support could not be automatically counted on this election. In a statement this week, the Uncommitted Movement - which is made up of traditionally Democratic members - said it could not endorse Harris because of her “unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing US and international human rights law”. US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?Soujoud Hamade is a lawyer in the Detroit suburb and president of the Michigan Chapter of the Arab American Bar Association. She canvassed for the Democratic Party in past elections, and feels her work helped get President Biden elected in 2020. He won Michigan with a margin of just 2.78%. This time around, Ms Hamade is voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. She is not alone. An August poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations indicates that in Michigan, 40% of Muslim voters back Stein, 18% preferred Republican Donald Trump - and only 12% supported Harris - suggesting a significant shift from past strong support for Democrats. Ms Hamade said the ""traditionally"" Democratic Arab-American voters in Michigan “cannot stomach the thought of voting for someone who's directly contributing to the death and destruction of our home country and of our relatives overseas”. Harris welcoming the endorsement of former Republican Vice-President Dick Cheney was particularly troubling for the Michigan lawyer. She said Cheney’s involvement in the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 makes him an unwanted bedfellow for her community. “It's baffling to me as an American, to now see the direction that the party is going, it's disheartening,"" she said. ""These aren't the values that we as Democrats stood for. We were not the party of war. "" Packed full of cafes, restaurants and independently owned stores, Dearborn enjoys a thriving small-business economy - as well as a strong community that is deeply affected by the conflict in the Middle East. Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the USDr Maisa Hider-Beidoun, who owns a chain of pharmacies and medical centres in the region, said she is a lifelong Democrat who does not know if she can support Harris. Her community has been placed in ""a moral dilemma”, she said. “We are good Americas, we are good tax-paying, law-abiding citizens, but our money is being funnelled overseas and killing people that are actually physically related to us. ""  In February's Democratic primary in Michigan, part of the process of choosing the party's presidential candidate, over 100,000 people in this community declared themselves ""uncommitted"" in protest at the Biden-Harris administration policy towards Gaza. The community says it has sought meetings with the White House and asked the vice-president to outline how her approach to Israel might differ from Biden's. While the Uncommitted Movement criticised Harris, it also opposes Trump, whose “agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organising”, it says. The organisation did not recommend its members vote for a third-party candidate like Stein. While Trump has been critical at times of Israel's handling of the war, he has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel. He has condemned pro-Palestinian protests and as president, angered Palestinians by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. He has said the war would not have happened if he were president but has said little on his plans to end the conflict. Dr Mona Mawari, a pharmacist and a community organiser who worked on the uncommitted campaign, told the BBC she is still struggling to decide how to vote in November - “a really hard decision”. Harris is “maybe a little more empathetic with her words” than Biden regarding what Dr Mawari describes as “genocide” in Gaza, but she finds it hard to support her. Harris has said she is aligned with Biden on US support for Israel though she has spoken more about the scale of the human suffering in Gaza. Said Dr Mawari: “The community is really upset, and they're very hyper-aware that lip service is just lip service, and without any actions they can't vote for her. ""  SIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the voteEXPLAINER: Seven swing states that could decide electionFACT CHECK: Was US economy stronger under Biden or Trump?POLICIES: What Harris or Trump would do in power The situation in Lebanon has also sharpened fears about an escalation in the regional conflict and, for this Arab-American community, what it means for their families there. Faye Nemer came to the US when she was 10, fleeing Lebanon because of the political instability and violence, and she is now the CEO of the Middle East North American Arab Chamber of Commerce. Before her family left Lebanon, she says they were “living as refugees” in their own country, moving between “abandoned office buildings”. So she looks at the situation in Gaza - where more than a million people have been displaced - through a different lens, particularly the experience of children. Her sister and much of her extended family are still in Lebanon. “It's difficult to conduct your day-to-day without that being top of mind,” she said. A lifelong Democrat, she has also not made up her mind on how - or if - she will vote, and is also weighing voting for a third-party candidate. Some 3.5 million Americans claimed Middle Eastern descent in the 2020 Census -around 1% of the population, though many are concentrated in battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Dr Mawari said the uncommitted movement doesn't want people to feel apathetic and not cast a ballot, but to use their vote in whichever way they believe is right. ""Sitting this one out is not an option. It's not an answer to what's going on,” she said.

3184,2024-10-07 23:41:31.616000+00:00,/news/articles/c2ek1ejj11ko,"A year ago, the images were searing. With Israel still reeling from the worst attack in its history and Gaza already under devastating bombardment, it felt like a turning point. The Israel-Palestine conflict, largely absent from our screens for years, had exploded back into view. It seemed to take almost everyone by surprise. The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had famously declared just a week before the attacks: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades. ”A year on, the region is in flames. More than 41,000 Palestinians are dead. Two million Gazans have been displaced. In the West Bank, another 600 Palestinians have been killed. In Lebanon, another one million people are displaced and more than 2,000 dead. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed on that first day. Since then, Israel has lost 350 more soldiers in Gaza. Two hundred thousand Israelis have been forced from their homes close to Gaza and along the volatile northern border with Lebanon. Around 50 soldiers and civilians have been killed by Hezbollah rockets. Across the Middle East, others have joined the fight. Dogged US efforts to prevent the crisis from escalating, involving presidential visits, countless diplomatic missions and the deployment of vast military resources, have all come to nothing. Rockets have been fired from far away in Iraq and Yemen. And mortal enemies Israel and Iran have exchanged blows too, with more almost certain to come. Washington has rarely looked less influential. As the conflict has spread and metastasised, its origins have faded from view, like the scene of a car crash receding in the rear view mirror of a juggernaut hurtling towards even bigger disasters. Listen to Paul read this article The lives of Gazans, before and after October 7, have been almost forgotten as the media breathlessly anticipates “all-out war” in the Middle East. Some Israelis whose lives were turned upside down that terrible day are feeling similarly neglected. “We have been pushed aside,” Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage Nimrod Cohen, told Israel’s Kan news last week. Mr Cohen said he held Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for a “pointless war that has pitted all possible enemies against us”. “He is doing everything, with great success, to turn the event of October 7 into a minor event,” he said. Not all Israelis share Mr Cohen’s particular perspective. Many now see the Hamas attacks of a year ago as the opening salvo of a wider campaign by Israel’s enemies to destroy the Jewish state. The fact that Israel has struck back - with exploding pagers, targeted assassinations, long-range bombing raids and the sort of intelligence-led operations the country has long prided itself on – has restored some of the self-confidence the country lost a year ago. “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,” Mr Netanyahu confidently declared last week. The prime minister’s poll ratings were rock bottom for months after October 7. Now he can see them creeping up again. A license, perhaps, for more bold action?But where’s it all going?“None of us know when the music is going to stop and where everybody will be at that point,” Simon Gass, Britain’s former ambassador to Iran, told the BBC’s Today Podcast on Thursday. The US is still involved, even if the visit to Israel of US Central Command (Centcom) chief Gen. Michael Kurilla feels more like crisis management than an exploration of diplomatic off-ramps. With a presidential election now just four weeks away and the Middle East more politically toxic than ever before, this doesn’t feel like a moment for bold new American initiatives. For now, the immediate challenge is simply to prevent a wider regional conflagration. There’s a general assumption, among her allies, that Israel has the right - even the duty - to respond to last week’s ballistic missile attack by Iran. No Israelis were killed in the attack and Iran appeared to be aiming at military and intelligence targets, but Mr Netanyahu has nevertheless promised a harsh response. After weeks of stunning tactical success, Israel’s prime minister seems to harbour grand ambitions. In a direct address to the Iranian people, he hinted that regime change was coming in Tehran. “When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, everything will be different,” he said. For some observers, his rhetoric carried uncomfortable echoes of the case made by American neoconservatives in the run up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But for all the danger of the moment, fragile guardrails do still exist. The Iranian regime may dream of a world without Israel, but it knows that it’s far too weak to take on the region’s only superpower, especially at a time when Hezbollah and Hamas - its allies and proxies in the so-called “axis of resistance” - are being crushed. And Israel, which would dearly like to get rid of the threat posed by Iran, also knows that it cannot do this alone, despite its recent successes. Regime change is not on Joe Biden’s agenda, nor that of his vice president, Kamala Harris. As for Donald Trump, the one time he seemed poised to attack Iran - after Tehran shot down a US surveillance drone in June 2019 - the former president backed down at the last moment (although he did order the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, seven months later). Few would have imagined, a year ago, that the Middle East was heading for its most perilous moment in decades. But looked at through that same juggernaut’s rear view mirror, the past 12 months seem to have followed a terrible logic. With so much wreckage now strewn all across the road, and events still unfolding at an alarming pace, policy makers - and the rest of us - are struggling to keep up. As the conflict that erupted in Gaza grinds on into a second year, all talk of the “day after” – how Gaza will be rehabilitated and governed when the fighting finally ends – has ceased, or been drowned out by the din of a wider war. So too has any meaningful discussion of a resolution of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians, the conflict which got us here in the first place. At some point, when Israel feels it has done enough damage to Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel and Iran have both had their say - assuming this doesn’t plunge the region into an even deeper crisis - and the US presidential election is over, diplomacy may get another chance.

3185,2024-10-03 14:09:00.303000+00:00,/news/articles/cqjrwg9dly1o,"Iranians have been expressing a mixture of pride, uncertainty and fear since their country launched a large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday night. Within minutes of the attack starting, Persian social media feeds were filled with shaky videos showing the flashes of the missiles flying overhead. Iran’s state television broadcast pictures of groups of people cheering on the streets, waving flags and chanting “Death to Israel”. But the mood was different online, with not everyone expressing support for the attack. Some shared tense scenes and heated debates about a possible war between the arch-foes, after decades of keeping their conflict largely in the shadows. The contrasting reactions laid bare the deep divisions in Iran, where there is widespread discontent at the clerical establishment and frustration over the economic troubles caused by sanctions. On one side of the debate are those who support the government's actions with nationalist pride, while on the other are those who fear war, economic collapse and further suppression of domestic reform movements. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Tuesday’s missile strike successfully targeted Israeli military and intelligence bases and that it was retaliation for recent killings of the leaders of its allies Hamas and Hezbollah. The Israeli military described the attack as ""indiscriminate"" and said that while it had been largely thwarted by air defences, there had been casualties and millions of Israelis had been sent running to bomb shelters. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Iran will pay for the ""big mistake"". For many supporters of the Iranian government, the attack represented a proud moment of defiance. “Bravo to [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei! Bravo to the Revolutionary Guards!” shouted a young woman in a clip that went viral. Such sentiment frustrated other Iranians online. “Please distinguish between the people and the Revolutionary Guards; we are under immense pressure,” pleaded a middle-aged man in a video shared on social media. Some Iranians felt the strike was an unnecessary provocation that would only result in making their lives worse. “We have no choice but to protect our country, but we are the ones who suffer the consequences,” said a concerned resident of the capital, Tehran. In the hours after the strikes, rumours surfaced that Israel might respond by targeting Iran’s oil infrastructure, which is an important part of the country’s economy. Videos quickly surfaced showing petrol stations overwhelmed, with long queues of people as they rushed to fill up their vehicles, fearing future shortages. The missile attack has also diminished hopes for diplomatic progress with the West and other countries in the region. The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as the new president in July had sparked optimism among those with moderate views. Some people saw him as a potential bridge in easing regional tensions. But one BBC Persian viewer lamented that “this attack is another step away from diplomacy and a step closer to conflict”. “I fear this war might be used as an excuse to intensify the crackdown of us, who are fighting for freedom,” a young activist said, referring to the nationwide “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests that erupted two years ago. Many worry that a new conflict could not only undermine calls for reform, but also empower the government to further suppress internal dissent. Unlike after previous escalations, this time there’s a growing fear of a potentially strong retaliatory response from Israel. And many believe that Israel’s advanced military capabilities could bring unprecedented destruction if a full-scale war broke out. “No-one wants war, not the people, not even the officials,” said a commentator on social media. This sense of vulnerability has made the situation feel more precarious than ever before. Amid the growing tensions, some people even called for regime change. “The only way to save Iran is not through war, but through toppling the current regime,” said another BBC News Persian viewer, urging the West to support Iranians in their struggle against the government. However, many believe the country’s future should be decided internally, free from any foreign intervention, to avoid the potential chaos that outside interference might cause.",Missile attack on Israel lays bare deep divisions among Iranians,Missile attack on Israel lays bare deep divisions among Iranians,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqjrwg9dly1o,articles/article_3185.txt,results/article_3185.txt.json
3186,2024-08-27 16:45:11.072000+00:00,/news/articles/c20rgvqr37ro,"A vessel suspected by the Namibian authorities to be carrying military cargo intended for Israeli use in the ongoing war in Gaza has been blocked from docking in the southern African country. Namibian Justice Minister Yvonne Dausab told state media the ship was stopped because it had “explosive material destined for Israel"". The MV Kathrin, which set off from Vietnam, had requested permission to dock in the port of Walvis Bay – before sailing north, on a suspected route towards the Mediterranean via the Strait of Gibraltar. Rights groups had warned that Namibia could have been implicated in potential human rights violations had it allowed the vessel to dock. It is not known why the ship wanted to dock, but vessels on long journeys tend to stop for supplies, respite or to offload or take on cargo. Last December, Namibia’s neighbour and ally South Africa launched an ongoing case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel rejects the allegation of genocide as ""baseless"". The conflict began after Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The Israeli military then launched a campaign to destroy Hamas and more than 40,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel rescues Bedouin hostage held by Hamas in GazaHas Israel taken enough action to prevent alleged incitement to genocide?What did ICJ ruling mean in South Africa's genocide case against Israel?Walvis Bay is Namibia’s largest commercial port, receiving nearly 900 vessels and handling about eight million tonnes of cargo per year, according to the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport). The MV Kathrin, which was set to dock at Walvis Bay on Monday from Vietnam, was stopped in accordance with Namibia's support for the Palestinian people and the country’s call for an end to the violence in Gaza, Ms Dausab told the state-run New Era news website, external. Citing a police investigation, Ms Dausab said the vessel was ""indeed carrying explosive material destined for Israel, and was therefore prohibited from entering Namibian waters"". “Namibia complies with our obligation not to support or be complicit in Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, as well as its unlawful occupation of Palestine,” she said. Namibian human rights organisation the Economic and Social Justice Trust (ESJT) welcomed the move. ""We are pleased that our government has decided to respect international law and decided not to be complicit to genocide,"" ESJT's Herbert Jauch told the BBC. Namport has not responded to the BBC for comment about the MV Kathrin. Before Ms Dausab’s statement it said it had not received pre-clearance documentation for the ship. The agency however pledged to ensure ""effective safety and security of our territorial waters and ports"". It also said it supported Namibia's ""standing and position on international relations and protocols"". Namport said it had recently allowed another vessel carrying ""dangerous cargo"" to pass through Namibian waters, but not to dock.

3187,2024-11-08 13:20:21.671000+00:00,/news/articles/cn5wel11pgdo,"The UN's Human Rights Office has condemned the high number of civilians killed in the war in Gaza, saying its analysis shows close to 70% of verified victims over a six-month period were women and children. The agency said the high number was largely due to Israel's use of weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas, although some deaths may have been the result of errant projectiles by Palestinian armed groups. The report said it found ""unprecedented"" levels of international law violations, raising concerns about ""war crimes and other possible atrocity crimes"". Israel has in the past said it targets Hamas and takes steps to mitigate risk to civilians by using precise munitions. The BBC contacted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment in response to Friday's report. The UN agency said it verified the details of 8,119 people killed in Gaza from November 2023 to April 2024. Its analysis found around 44% of verified victims were children and 26% women. The ages most represented among the dead were five to nine-year-olds. About 80% of victims were killed in residential buildings or similar housing, the agency added. The report said the data indicates ""an apparent indifference to the death of civilians and the impact of the means and methods of warfare"". Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN sees as reliable, has reported a death toll of more than 43,300 people over the past 13 months. Many more bodies are believed to remain under the rubble of bombarded buildings. The health ministry said it obtained full demographic data for a majority of those killed and reported that children account for one in three of that number. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said in a statement that ""this unprecedented level of killing, and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law"". He cited the laws of distinction, which requires warring parties to distinguish between combatants and civilians, proportionality, which prohibits attacks where harm to civilians outweighs military advantage, and precautions in attacks. Türk called for a ""due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law"". The IDF has previously told the BBC in response to criticism that it ""will continue to act, as it always has done, according to international law"". The report also said the way the warring parties have conducted the conflict in Gaza has ""caused horrific human suffering"". The UN said Palestinian armed groups have waged war from densely-populated areas and indiscriminately used projectiles, likely contributing to the death toll, while the IDF has destroyed civilian infrastructure and ""left many of those alive, injured, displaced and starving, without access to adequate water, food or healthcare"". The situation is worst in north Gaza, which aid groups say has been under siege since early October when Israel launched a new ground offensive against Hamas. The UN said no food aid entered the north during the first two weeks of October. This prompted the US to issue an ultimatum to Israel to increase aid by 12 November or risk losing some military support. Jan Egeland, the head of aid organisation Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC on Friday that he saw ""devastation, despair, beyond belief"" on a recent visit to Gaza. ""There is hardly a building that is not damaged. And large areas looked like Stalingrad after the Second World War. You cannot fathom how intense this indiscriminate bombing has been on this trapped population,"" he said. ""It's evident that it is first and foremost children and women who are paying a price for this senseless war,"" he added.

3188,2024-11-15 15:15:21.290000+00:00,/news/articles/cgk18pdnxmmo,"The Chief of Staff to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being investigated by police over allegations of altering documents relating to the 7 October Hamas attack to portray his boss in a more favourable light. Tzachi Braverman, one of Netanyahu’s closest advisors, was questioned by the Israeli police Lahav 433 major crimes unit for over five hours on Thursday, according to reports in Israeli media. Detectives have confirmed an investigation is under way. The accusation is focused around two telephone calls that Netanyahu received as the Hamas cross border raid was unfolding on 7 October 2023. Israel's Netanyahu shows who calls the shots with Gallant sacking Braverman is suspected of having altered the documented time when Netanyahu first received an update on the attack via a telephone call from his military secretary at the time, Major General Avi Gil. The chief of staff is accused of changing the time from 06:40 to 06:29. He denies having altered the transcript of the call other than to change the time. “I know that the first call was received at 06:29, that’s why I insisted on changing it,” he is reported to have told detectives during the interrogation. While Gil had phoned Netanyahu at 06:29, as the Hamas attack began, Netanyahu did not give any instructions, telling him instead to phone again in 10 minutes, at 06:40, according to a report in the Haaretz newspaper. It was only during the second phone call for which Braverman allegedly altered the time stamp to appear as though it was the first, that Netanyahu ordered Gil to hold a situational assessment on the developing Hamas invasion, Haaretz reported. The allegation is that Braverman altered the time, in order to give the impression that the prime minister had acted more urgently and more decisively. The chief of staff denies that. The 7 October attack was the biggest military and intelligence failure in Israel’s history. Several senior military officials have already resigned over it. Netanyahu has consistently denied any personal failure. His critics though, believe it is the prime minister who was ultimately responsible for the failure to prevent the deadliest attack on the country since the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948. Various investigations are under way into the military and intelligence failures and Netanyahu has rejected claims he is stalling on demands for a full-scale inquiry. This potential scandal is in its infancy, but it could go on to seriously undermine the Prime Minister’s position. And it comes at a time when Netanyahu is mid-way through a trial facing corruption charges. He is due to testify in that trial next month, having failed to have the case thrown out, believing it is a political witch-hunt.",Netanyahu aide investigated over 7 October document changes,Netanyahu aide investigated over 7 October document changes,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgk18pdnxmmo,articles/article_3188.txt,results/article_3188.txt.json
3189,2024-11-04 12:25:10.320000+00:00,/news/articles/cd9n02xxexko,"A mother whose son is being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has accused Israel's government of “a cynical deception operation that is taken from dark regimes”, after it emerged a government spokesperson had been arrested for allegedly leaking documents that may have undermined a ceasefire and hostage release deal. It came after a court in Rishon LeZion said Eli Feldstein and three others were under investigation for feeding stories to European newspapers. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Radio also reported a fifth arrest in connection with the probe, said to be a major in the military's intelligence branch information security department, tasked with preventing and investigating leaks. The Haaretz newspaper said all unnamed suspects were from this unit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing by his staff, but opposition figures and hostages' families have accused his government of sabotaging negotiations. The stories, given to Britain’s Jewish Chronicle and Germany’s tabloid Bild, were based on partial or false information and came at a crucial time for hostage negotiations. Speaking at a protest in Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan has been held by Hamas for over a year, said the stories “supported Netanyahu’s propaganda lies to torpedo the deal"". The documents claimed Hamas was planning to smuggle Israeli hostages to Egypt  - intent on scuppering any proposed ceasefire deal. Some commentators say the revelations were politically useful for Netanyahu’s hardline position on the talks, which have made almost no progress. Over 100 hostages out of 251 taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 remain unaccounted for. After the stories were published in September, the IDF launched an inquiry to discover the source of the leaks. This eventually led to the arrest of Eli Feldstein, along with the three others, whose identities have not been revealed. Mr Feldstein had been working as a government spokesperson and was often seen accompanying the prime minister on visits. He had previously worked for the far-right Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and before that he served as an IDF spokesperson. Following news of his arrest, two leading opposition politicians held a news conference. Benny Gantz, who until recently was in Netanyahu’s war cabinet, said that if sensitive security information was used for a ""political survival campaign”, it would not only be a criminal offence, but ""a crime against the nation"". Speaking at the same event, the leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said that if the prime minister knew about the leaks, ""he is complicit in one of the most serious security offences” and that if he didn’t know, he is not fit for office. The revelations also led to strong criticism from the families of the hostages, who have become increasingly frustrated with the government’s failure to secure the release of their loved ones. They said it implied an active campaign to discredit them, calling it ""a moral low that has no depth. This is a fatal injury to the remnants of trust between the government and its citizens. ""The documents were published in European newspapers, allegedly to circumvent military censorship laws in Israel. The Jewish Chronicle (JC) was engulfed in a scandal after it emerged it had published stories based on a single anonymous source. The freelance writer behind the pieces was fired, with the articles eventually being taken down. The articles claimed that the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar - who was killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza last month - was surrounded by a ring of about 20 hostages, and that plans had been discovered to smuggle both Sinwar and the captives into Egypt. Leading Israeli security journalists questioned the veracity of the reports. A number of high-profile writers resigned from the paper, accusing it of lacking journalistic standards. Jonathan Freedland, Hadley Freeman and David Aaronovitch announced they were quitting their columns over what Freedland described as a ""great disgrace"" at the world’s oldest Jewish newspaper. At the time, the JC said it conducted a ""thorough investigation"" into one of its freelance journalists, Elon Perry, ""after allegations were made about aspects of his record"". It said it was ""not satisfied"" with some of the claims made by the writer, and therefore had deleted his articles and ended its association with him. Elon Perry told BBC News the JC ""made a huge mistake with its statement"". He said he could not reveal his source to JC editors and described a ""witch-hunt against me caused by jealousy"". The Bild articles, meanwhile, were based on a different set of intelligence documents. While they were found to be authentic, leading security journalist Ronan Bergman found their significance had been greatly exaggerated. It was the publication of this story that triggered the investigation by the IDF and security services, ultimately leading to the arrests. Despite the fierce criticism he is facing, few people here think the scandal will prove fatal for Netanyahu’s premiership. He is already facing multiple court cases on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies, yet remains in power, propped up by a coalition of far-right and religious parties. “It’s not like there’s a charge where you can say, ‘Well, they haven’t thrown this yet against the prime minister, this is going to bring him down,’” says Anshel Pfeffer, a leading commentator for the Haaretz newspaper. He told me there was no sign of the government collapsing. “Their line has been that he is the victim of a cabal of lawyers and journalists, and now they’re also adding in the security establishment, who they say are out to get him. ”Netanyahu has sought to distance himself from the allegations, saying the arrested spokesperson had never had access to classified information. Despite that, this is a growing scandal that has further damaged the already frayed relationship between the government and the hostage families.","Netanyahu aide leaks may have harmed hostage talks, court says","Netanyahu aide leaks may have harmed hostage talks, court says","israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9n02xxexko,articles/article_3189.txt,results/article_3189.txt.json
3190,2024-09-02 22:10:38.999000+00:00,/news/articles/cn02pz4wnyro,"Benjamin Netanyahu has asked for ""forgiveness"" from Israelis for failing to return six hostages found dead in Gaza on Saturday, as Hamas warned more could be ""returned to their families in shrouds"" if a ceasefire isn't reached. His comments came as intense street protests over his handling of negotiations entered a second night in Israel. Pressure also mounted internationally as the UK suspended some arms sales to Israel, citing a risk of equipment being used to violate international law. But Israel's prime minister struck a defiant tone, insisting its troops must control Gaza's Philadelphi Corridor - a strategically important strip of land which is a sticking point in negotiations with Hamas. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday in fresh protests called by hostages' families to express their anger at Mr Netanyahu's failure to bring home their loved ones after almost 11 months. The Times of Israel reported that police were using considerable aggression at one protest outside the prime minister’s home in Jerusalem, including violently pushing protesters, throwing some to the ground, and dragging many away. One member of the police squeezed the throat of a Times of Israel reporter, according to the newspaper. The latest demonstrations come after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protests across the country on Sunday, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv. Many wore Israeli flags and hung yellow ribbons - a symbol of solidarity with the hostages - from a bridge overlooking the Ayalon Highway. A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October last year. Hamas said on Monday that hostages would be returned ""inside coffins"" if military pressure from Israel continues and added that ""new instructions"" have been given to militants guarding captives if they are approached by Israeli troops. ""Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive,"" a spokesperson for the group said, without elaborating on what new orders had been issued. Earlier on Monday, Israel's biggest trade union said hundreds of thousands of people had joined a general strike called to put pressure on the government to agree a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. Despite this, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport reported limited disruption and many restaurants and hospitality services operated as normal. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich boasted that Israelis had gone to work “in droves” and proved that they were no longer slaves to “political needs”. Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden said Mr Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports suggesting a new proposal would be sent to the Israeli prime minister as ""final"". Many accuse Mr Netanyahu of blocking a deal to prioritise his own political survival - a claim he rejects. Mr Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to pull out of the coalition government, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he were to accept a deal tied to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas was destroyed. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held, including 33 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that the UK had suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, citing a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. The affected equipment includes parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant posted on X, to say he was ""deeply disheartened"" by the move, while Foreign Minister Israel Katz said it sent a ""very problematic message"" to Hamas and Iran. Meanwhile, funeral services for some of the hostages killed on Saturday have been held. The mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin - one of the hostages whose body was recovered by Israel on Saturday - spoke at his funeral and said she had been in ""such torment and worry"" about him for months. Rachel Goldberg-Polin said it had been a ""stunning honour"" to be her son’s mother. Around the time of his kidnap, Hersh sent two texts to his family, writing: ""I love you guys,” and ""I’m sorry"". Mourners lined the streets in Jerusalem and Israel's President Isaac Herzog spoke to relatives at the funeral. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Netanyahu asks 'forgiveness' over hostage deaths as protests continue,Netanyahu asks 'forgiveness' over hostage deaths as protests continue,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn02pz4wnyro,articles/article_3190.txt,results/article_3190.txt.json
3192,2024-07-24 21:24:45.387000+00:00,/news/articles/c4ng9ed3gj0o,"Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers ""our enemies are your enemies"" in a landmark speech to Congress intended to rally support for the war against Hamas in Gaza, but marked by pro-Palestinian protests inside and outside the Capitol. ""When we fight Iran, we're fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States of America,"" Mr Netanyahu said. ""Our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory,"" he added. The Israeli leader received a raucous reception from mostly Republican politicians as he delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress, his fourth. In contrast, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, criticised the address in a post on X. ""Benjamin Netanyahu’s presentation in the House Chamber today was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States,"" she said. Ms Pelosi did not attend the address, instead meeting with Israelis affected by the 7 October Hamas attack, according to a statement from her office. She said she hoped the prime minister would spend time working towards a ""ceasefire deal that will bring the hostages home"". Growing political divisions over the war in Gaza were underscored by the dozens of Democratic members of Congress deliberately not present and thousands of protesters on the streets outside. Crowds gathered by a stage on Capitol Hill decked with banners, including one declaring the Israeli leader a ""wanted war criminal,"" a reference to an arrest warrant sought by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Five people were arrested inside the Capitol building for attempting to disrupt Mr Netanyahu's address, according to police. Addressing the protesters, Mr Netanyahu said: ""You have officially become Iran's useful idiots. ""In one of many references to Iran, the Israeli prime minister claimed an “axis of terror” threatened the US, Israel and the Arab world, framing it as a “clash of barbarism against civilisations”. The term riffed off what Iran describes as the ""axis of resistance,"" an alliance across the Middle East including the Palestinian armed group Hamas, the Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Houthis, who rule parts of Yemen. He told Congress that Iranian proxy forces had attacked American targets, adding that Iran believes that ""to truly challenge America it must first conquer the Middle East"". ""But in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran's way, is one proud pro-American democracy: my country, the state of Israel. "" Speaking for over an hour, Mr Netanyahu deflected criticism of Israel and framed the war in Gaza as his country’s battle for survival, in a pitch for further US military aid. He thanked the US for providing Israel with ""generous military assistance"" for decades, adding that in return Israel had provided the US with critical intelligence that had ""saved many lives"". But he called for a process of ""fast-tracking"" US military aid, claiming this could expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader regional war. Quoting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's appeal to the American people during World War Two, he said: ""Give us the tools and we'll finish the job. "" Mr Netanyahu did not discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza at length, except to maintain that Israel delivers enough food aid to provide each person with 3,000 calories. If Gaza's residents were not getting food, he said, it was because ""Hamas steals it"". Outlining his vision for the Gaza Strip after the war, he called for ""a demilitarised and deradicalised"" enclave under Israeli military control. ""Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel. That's not too much to ask,"" he said. He made no reference to the prospect of an eventual two-state solution, something President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris - who is likely to replace him as the Democratic Party nominee - want. Several standing ovations could not disguise the fact that at least 39 lawmakers  were absent from the address. Almost all were Democrats, among them influential former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who said it was ""inappropriate"" for Mr Netanyahu to visit. Ms Harris was not in attendance, reportedly due to a scheduling clash. Throughout the speech, Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American member of Congress, was seen holding a placard in the air, which read ""guilty of genocide"" and ""war criminal"". Conscious that Donald Trump could return to the White House, Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked the former president for moving the American embassy to Jerusalem and for recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, a territory Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The two men will meet in Florida later this week. At home in Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered to condemn the speech as it was broadcast, silently, on to the central area known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. After listening to the national anthem, the crowd dispersed as Mr Netanyahu continued his address on screen. The audio was muted, but his English speech was shown with subtitles in Hebrew translation. Shortly after the end of the speech, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of two hostages, Maya Goren and Oren Goldin, from Gaza. The news underscored the growing despair many hostage families feel towards the prospect of seeing their loved ones alive again, with months-long negotiations with Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage release deal still not having borne fruit. The prime minister's address to Congress came nine months into Israel's campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 39,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",Netanyahu defends Gaza war as protesters rally outside US Congress,Netanyahu defends Gaza war as protesters rally outside US Congress,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ng9ed3gj0o,articles/article_3192.txt,results/article_3192.txt.json
3193,2024-09-04 21:07:12.961000+00:00,/news/articles/cgl2370ldxro,"Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has again insisted that Israeli forces will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor - a strategically important strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt. He told foreign media in Jerusalem that he is “open” to considering alternatives to the presence of Israeli troops along the Gaza-Egypt border, as part of any future permanent ceasefire deal – but that he did not see it happening. Mr Netanyahu argued that Israeli troops must remain in this buffer zone to prevent weapons and possibly Israeli hostages being smuggled across the border. Hamas said in a statement cited by Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu's decision not to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor is an attempt to thwart the ceasefire agreement, adding that it was time to put pressure on Israel. Extremist settlers rapidly seizing West Bank landNetanyahu not doing enough to free Gaza hostages, says BidenHope is all we've got, says Hamas victim's brother Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said conditions for any permanent ceasefire must include ""a situation where the Philadelphi corridor cannot be perforated. ""He said if someone could show, “not on paper, not in words, not in a slide, but on the ground, day after day, week after week, month after month that they can actually prevent the recurrence of what happened there before we're open to consider it. ”But, he continued, “I don’t see that happening […]  And until that happens, we are there. ”His comments open a miniscule crack in his repeated insistence that Israeli forces would not leave Gaza’s southern border. But he also doubled-down on his insistence that Israel needed to keep troops there for its security, describing it as a “red line”. “People said: this will kill the deal,” he continued. “And I say: such a deal will kill us. ”Making more concessions after Hamas killed six hostages last week would be “illogical”, “immoral” and “insane,” he insisted.  “We have red lines. They haven’t changed. We’ll hold to them. ” His security chiefs, including his defence minister, are widely reported to have backed alternatives to a military presence along the border, such as technological solutions to monitor activity there, or the presence of allied forces. Leaks to Israeli media have described shouting matches between the prime minister and his defence chiefs in meetings, with Mr Netanyahu reportedly accused of not wanting a deal at all. A growing number of people here appear to believe that the prime minister is playing for time, and that his real goal is to find and kill the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, before ending the war. Mr Netanyahu says he is safeguarding Israel’s security in the face of extraordinary international pressure.  And that it is Hamas who is blocking a deal. Talks on a permanent ceasefire would only take place once Israel and Hamas agree to begin the first phase of a three-step plan, which is being pushed heavily by US President Joe Biden. Israel’s national public radio quoted an unnamed senior official who said that the chief negotiator, Mossad head David Barnea, had conveyed to mediators Israel’s agreement to withdraw troops from the border at a later stage in the ceasefire process. But even getting agreement on the first stage is proving tricky, with many issues still unresolved.",Netanyahu doubles down on control of Gaza's border with Egypt,Netanyahu doubles down on control of Gaza's border with Egypt,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgl2370ldxro,articles/article_3193.txt,results/article_3193.txt.json
3194,2024-09-30 20:32:26.623000+00:00,/news/articles/c243zempn6zo,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s popularity, which was battered after the Hamas attacks on 7 October, has been boosted by his country’s military successes against Hezbollah, a new opinion poll suggests. A picture has been widely shared of the Israeli PM in New York giving the order for the biggest of these - the assassination of the Lebanese armed group’s long-time chief, Hassan Nasrallah. A poll for Israel’s Channel 12, released on Sunday night, indicates the Israeli PM's Likud party would win more seats than any other if a general election was held. However, it did not project a win for him overall, instead suggesting the current opposition parties would have more MPs, enabling them to form a coalition. Fortunately for Netanyahu, his former political rival, Gideon Saar, also joined his fractious coalition government on Sunday, a step that should strengthen the prime minister. “We will work together, shoulder to shoulder, and I intend to seek his assistance in the forums that influence the conduct of the war,” Netanyahu said. Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio with a seat in the Security Cabinet, the body overseeing the management of the war against Israel’s regional enemies. By joining the government with his four-seat party, Netanyahu has a much more solid majority of 68 in the 120-seat parliament. Rumours had swirled in recent weeks that the position of defence minister currently held by the popular, seasoned, former military general Yoav Gallant would go to the relatively less experienced Saar. However, that move seemed to be abandoned as Israel began its series of major strikes against Hezbollah. For Netanyahu, the new composition of the government weakens the power of his National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. The far-right winger has repeatedly threatened to topple the coalition if it goes ahead with a “reckless” deal to end the war in Gaza and bring home hostages or agrees to a permanent ceasefire with Hezbollah. The coalition could now survive without Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party’s six seats, giving Netanyahu more room for manoeuvre. Once seen as a rising star of Likud, Saar left the party and became one of the most vocal critics of the prime minister arguing that Netanyahu should not continue to serve while battling corruption charges.  He has framed his decision to join the government as an act of patriotism, fostering unity. However, he has been sharply criticised by some Israeli commentators who describe him as acting cynically in his own self-interest. “Saar’s decision to join the government is certainly a painful blow to a large number of Israelis who think that Netanyahu needs to go, and not just because he is being tried on criminal charges, and not just because he is the most corrupt, hedonistic and lying prime minister Israel has ever had,” said Yedioth Ahronoth columnist, Sima Kadmon. She sees that his action “will stabilise and boost the worst government ever to have served in Israel, so much so that the original date of the next elections, October 2026, now appears to be a realistic date"". Certainly, the extra seats could also help solve another challenge facing Israel’s most far-right ever government. At this sensitive time of war, when the military has a pressing need to expand its ranks, divisions have opened over the passage of a new military conscription law. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled in June that the state must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students into the army. They have historically been exempted, and such a move is vehemently opposed by two ultra-Orthodox parties upon which the coalition depends. Deepening his personal rift with the prime minister, in July, Yoav Gallant approved a plan to begin sending out draft notices to 1,000 18-26-year-olds from the ultra-Orthodox community. A slick political strategist, Netanyahu - Israel’s longest serving leader - did see a big drop in the support for his party in polls at the end of last year. His personal image as “Mr Security” was badly damaged after the 7 October attacks - the deadliest day in Israeli history, when Hamas surprised one of the world’s best intelligence services and the best resourced military in the region took hours to respond. However, by August, opinion polls suggested the prime minister had begun to bounce back. That was despite the invasion of Gaza turning into Israel’s longest ever war with no sign of its objectives being met: the complete destruction of Hamas and bringing home Israel’s remaining hostages. The latest poll gives Likud as many as 25 seats. Altogether coalition parties would be expected to take 49 seats, while opposition parties would win 66. According to the research for Channel 12, Netanyahu also remains the favourite candidate for prime minister over the centrist opposition leader, Yair Lapid - with 38% favouring him over his rival who has 27% support. Much in Israeli politics depends on what happens next as Israel’s multi-front war reaches a critical moment. As Israel hints at a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, tens of thousands of Israeli citizens in the north of the country still do not know when they will return to their homes - an official goal for Israel. If Hezbollah’s main ally Iran decides to attack, the consequences are unpredictable. On the international stage, Israel looks increasingly isolated. International courts are considering whether to put Israel on trial for genocide and have requested an arrest warrant for the prime minister and his defence minister on allegations of crimes against humanity. The ultimate test of Netanyahu’s resilience could be yet to come.",Netanyahu in poll rebound after Hezbollah attacks,Netanyahu in poll rebound after Hezbollah attacks,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c243zempn6zo,articles/article_3194.txt,results/article_3194.txt.json
3195,2024-09-02 14:41:03.625000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2np7p1yr7o,"US President Joe Biden has said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports that a new ""final"" proposal would be sent to the Israeli leader. Mr Biden and Kamala Harris, his vice-president, met US negotiators to hammer out a proposal, as protests engulfed Israel on Monday after the discovery of six more hostage bodies in Gaza. Asked whether Mr Netanyahu was doing enough, Mr Biden replied ""no"". He added that the US would not give up, and would ""push as hard as we can"" for a deal. US officials have characterised this latest proposal as a ""take it or leave it deal"", the Washington Post has reported. Among the bodies recovered from Gaza on Saturday was that of 23-year-old Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. He became one of the most recognisable hostages in the crisis after being seized by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in southern Israel on 7 October last year. The discovery of the bodies has caused widespread protests in Israel from those critical of Mr Netanyahu's handling of the war and hostage crisis. On Monday, thousands of people joined a strike called by the country's biggest trade union, in an effort to put pressure on Mr Netanyahu to close out a deal. Goldberg-Polin's funeral was held in Jerusalem on the same day, attended by thousands. His mother Rachel - who also spoke at last month's Democratic convention in the US - described her torment. President Isaac Herzog offered an apology that his country had ""failed"" to protect Goldberg-Polin or bring him home. In comments of his own on the same day, Mr Netanyahu appealed to Israelis for ""forgiveness"" over the group's deaths. Mr Biden said the US was ""devastated and outraged"" by the death of Mr Goldberg-Polin and the five others. ""Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,"" he said. Mr Biden spoke after Monday's meeting with negotiators in the White House Situation Room. US officials said he and Ms Harris discussed next steps in the effort to release of the hostages, including continuing talks with co-mediators Qatar and Egypt. Thousands join strike in Israel amid calls for hostage dealNetanyahu asks 'forgiveness' over hostage deathsMr Biden is expected to present a ""final"" hostage release and ceasefire proposal later this week, according to the Axios website, which cited US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in conversation with the US families of remaining hostages. The US family of Edan Alexander, a member of the Israeli military who is still a hostage in Gaza, have pushed for Israel to accept the deal, saying it is ""now or never"". His father Adi Alexander praised the US for its ""dedication and commitment"" to secure a deal, saying that his meeting on Sunday was his 15th with Mr Sullivan since 7 October last year. But in an interview with BBC’s US partner CBS News on Monday, Mr Alexander appealed to US officials to ""do something different, because the outcome is the same after 11 months"". Mr Alexander accused Mr Netanyahu of ""prolonging the war for short-term political gain"". He added: ""Time is passing by and we're getting more bodies out of Gaza. This is unacceptable. "" In its report, the Washington Post reported that the killing of the six hostages had increased the urgency among Mr Biden's aides to push for a deal. ""You can't keep negotiating this. This process has to be called at some point,"" one senior official told the newspaper. ""Does it derail the deal? No. If anything, it should add additional urgency in this closing phase, which we were already in,"" they added. The US, Qatar and Egypt have for months tried to secure a deal that includes a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The Biden administration has criticised Hamas for failing to agree to a deal, though US foreign officials have also accused Mr Netanyahu of making demands that have also derailed efforts. The war in the Gaza Strip began after the Hamas breached the Gaza boundary, killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted 251 in their attack last year. Israel has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians in retaliatory attacks, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The US response to the war has had implications for the Biden administration and Ms Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's US presidential election. Pro-Palestinian factions in the party have urged for a ceasefire. Ms Harris's opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, has blamed Ms Harris and Mr Biden's failure to secure a deal for the hostage deaths last weekend.","Netanyahu not doing enough to free Gaza hostages, says Biden","Netanyahu not doing enough to free Gaza hostages, says Biden","israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2np7p1yr7o,articles/article_3195.txt,results/article_3195.txt.json
3196,2024-08-21 10:15:58.439000+00:00,/news/articles/cjdkyyn1lr4o,"The daughter of one of the six Israeli hostages whose bodies were brought back from Gaza by Israel’s military on Tuesday has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of putting “political priorities” ahead of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Inbal Albini Peri told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her 80-year-old father Chaim and his friends would have been among the first people freed under any agreement with Hamas and that they “should have come back alive”. Mr Netanyahu has insisted he is making every effort to bring back all of the remaining hostages kidnapped during Hamas’s 7 October attack. But Ms Albini Peri said: “I don’t believe a word he is saying. ” “I want him to say to my family and all the other families: ‘I’m sorry. I was wrong. ""In her interview, Ms Peri did not explicitly explain what she meant by ""political priorities"". Mr Netanyahu's far-right allies have vowed to pull out of his coalition, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he agrees to release large numbers of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return for hostages. On Tuesday evening, a senior US administration official criticised the prime minister for making what they called “maximalist statements” that were “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. It followed reported comments by Mr Netanyahu suggesting he had told the US secretary of state that Israeli forces must stay in strategic parts of Gaza, which Hamas rejects. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 105 hostages are still being held, 34 of whom are presumed dead. Chaim Peri lived in Kibbutz Nir Oz, which was one of the 26 communities and towns close to the Gaza perimeter fence targeted by Hamas on 7 October. The film lecturer and lifelong peace activist was abducted after he voluntarily left the saferoom of his home to protect his wife, Osnat, who was hiding inside. Inbal Peri's 34-year-old half-brother, Danny Darlington, was also killed in the attack. In December, Hamas’s military wing released a video showing Mr Peri along with two other elderly hostages from Nir Oz - Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper. Mr Peri could be seen addressing the camera and calling for their release. “That is more or less the last that we heard from him. Now we know that he probably died around February,” Ms Peri told the BBC. In June, the Israeli military informed the family that Mr Peri, Mr Metzger, Mr Cooper and British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell had been killed during an operation in the Khan Younis area, in southern Gaza, citing intelligence it had gathered. On Tuesday morning, Ms Peri was told that Israeli troops had recovered the bodies of her father and five other hostages - Mr Metzger, Mr Popplewell, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder and Yagev Buchshtab - from underground tunnels in Khan Younis. “For my family it’s maybe a small closure. It’s not the right word to say ‘happy’, but for us it is the end of the way and we are burying our father in the place that he loved so much,” she said. “But there are other hostages that are still alive, and the chances that will come back alive are getting smaller. ”Ms Peri said she believed that her father and his friends from Nir Oz also should have come home alive as part of a new hostage release deal, which the US, Qatar and Egypt were trying to broker before her father was thought to have died and are continuing to do now. “It only depended on our government and the mental standing of our prime minister, who had different priorities. He had political priorities. And that makes us very, very angry and frustrated. “I’m not saying that we could really stop the war, but we had to do the negotiations instead of keeping on fighting. We have seen for over 10 months that it’s not working. ”When asked if she had put this directly to Mr Netanyahu or other members of his government, she replied: “Many people from the government did talk to us and try to help. But when the head is wrong, it doesn’t matter. ”She added: “We want our government and our prime minister to go ahead and have a deal, to have something to talk about, instead of risking over and over again our soldiers to bring back bodies. We don’t want any more soldiers to be killed. ”“Bring back all the hostages because they are still alive. And their time is really running out. ”On Tuesday night, Mr Netanyahu’s office said he had told hostages’ families in Jerusalem that “the first thing is to eliminate Hama and achieve victory”, external. “The second thing is that we are, at the same time, making an effort to return the hostages, on terms that will allow for the maximum number of hostages being released in the first stage of the deal. I say this clearly: This is an objective that I have set,” he added. “However, the other thing is to preserve our strategic security assets in the face of major domestic and foreign pressure, and we are doing so.

The Israeli prime minister's comments came on Friday during a visit to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a day after he discussed ceasefire efforts with US President Joe Biden and Ms Harris, the vice-president, in Washington. The Biden administration said Israel and the US were closing ""gaps"" on the issue. Ms Harris, the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate, however, said that she would ""not be silent"" on the ""tragedy"" and the ""suffering"" of Gazan civilians as she called for all parties to reach an agreement. ""It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,"" Ms Harris said. After his meeting with Trump, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel would send negotiators ""probably at the beginning of the week"" to talks in Rome. He said that there was ""some movement"" on ceasefire efforts ""because of the military pressure we exerted"". However, he said that ""I think to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no daylight between Israel and the United States, that it expedites the deal,"" he said. ""And I hope that those [Harris's] comments don't change that. ""Hamas invaded southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, and taking 251 people hostage.

The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu and several Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. All reject the allegations. The Rome talks are the latest in a series of initiatives to end the war. The US is sending the head of the CIA, Bill Burns, to meet representatives from Qatar, Egypt and Israel. The talks are scheduled to begin on Sunday. They will discuss a deal to end hostilities and return hostages still held in Gaza. Trump said on Friday that he would commit to seeking peace if re-elected, and attacked Ms Harris's comments the day before as ""disrespectful"" to Israel. He said that his own relationship with Mr Netanyahu was ""always good. No president has done what I've done for Israel and we've always had a very good relationship.

The administration also withdrew from an international deal with Iran aimed at halting its nuclear weapons programme - a move backed by Israel but criticised by European states. It developed the ""Abraham accords"", which sought to normalise relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.

Benjamin Netanyahu's appeal on Tuesday came as Israel expanded its invasion against Hezbollah by sending thousands more troops into a new zone in south-west Lebanon. Its military said 50 Hezbollah members were killed in air strikes on Monday. The Lebanese health ministry said 36 people were killed and 150 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched barrages of rockets towards the Israeli port of Haifa for the third consecutive day, injuring 12 people. Follow live updates on this storyLebanon abandoned by international community - ex PMAnalysis: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider warAnalysis: What will it take to end the conflict? During a video address directed at the people of Lebanon, Netanyahu said: ""You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. ""I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end. ""Netanyahu also claimed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had killed the successor to Hezbollah's late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. ""We have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,"" he said. Hashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official widely expected to succeed his cousin Nasrallah as leader, has not been heard from publicly since an Israeli air strike reportedly targeted him in Beirut last Thursday. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday evening it could not confirm that Safieddine was killed in the attack, adding that it was examining the results of the operation. Hezbollah has remained defiant despite three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks that Lebanese officials say have killed more than 1,400 people and displaced another 1.2 million. Earlier on Tuesday, Nasrallah's former deputy, Naim Qassem, insisted Hezbollah had overcome the recent “painful blows” from Israel and that its capabilities were “fine”. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. On Tuesday morning, the IDF announced that reservists from its 146th Division had begun “limited, localized, targeted operational activities” in south-western Lebanon. It joined three standing army divisions which have been operating in central and eastern areas of southern Lebanon since the invasion began on 30 September - reportedly bringing the total number of soldiers deployed to over 15,000. The IDF said troops had taken control of what it called a Hezbollah “combat compound” in the border village of Maroun al-Ras and published photos showing what it said was a loaded rocket launcher in an olive grove, as well as weapons and equipment inside a residential building. Drone footage meanwhile showed widespread destruction in the nearby village of Yaroun, external, which was an initial target of the invasion. Meanwhile, the UN special co-ordinator for Lebanon and the head of the UN peacekeeping force warned in a joint statement that the humanitarian impact of the conflict was “nothing short of catastrophic”. Lebanon’s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Almost 180,000 people are in approved centres for the displaced. In addition, more than 400,000 people have fled into war-torn Syria, including more than 200,000 Syrian refugees - a situation that the head of the UN’s refugee agency described as one of “tragic absurdity”. The World Food Programme said there was “extraordinary concern for Lebanon's ability to continue to feed itself” because thousands of hectares of farmland had been burned or abandoned. The IDF also said its aircraft had carried out a new round of strikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group has a strong presence, and other areas of Lebanon on Tuesday. Earlier, it announced that a strike in the capital on Monday had killed the commander of Hezbollah’s headquarters, Suhail Husseini. Hezbollah did not comment on the claim. But if confirmed, it would be the latest in a series of severe blows Israel has dealt to the group, with Hassan Nasrallah and most of its military commanders having been killed in similar recent strikes. Hezbollah's deputy leader said in a defiant televised address from an undisclosed location on Tuesday that its command and control was “solid” and had “no vacant positions”, citing its attacks on Israel in recent days. ""We are hurting them and we will prolong the time. Dozens of cities are within range of the resistance's missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine,"" Naim Qassem said. But, for the first time, he made no mention of ending the war in Gaza as a pre-condition where previously Hezbollah has said it would not stop attacking Israel until the Gaza conflict is over. ""We support the political efforts that (Lebanese Parliament Speaker) Nabih Berri is undertaking towards a ceasefire,"" Qassem said in a televised speech. ""Once a ceasefire is achieved, diplomacy can look into all the other details. ""It was not clear if this meant a change in Hezbollah’s position.

The five men, all from the Netherlands and aged between 18 and 37, are suspected of ""public violence against persons"" before and after the Maccabi Tel Aviv match against local team Ajax. Unrest flared up again in the city on Monday evening when an empty tram and a police car were set alight. Some rioters reportedly shouted ""Free Palestine"", according to Dutch reports. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said earlier on Monday that ""antisemitic attacks against Israelis and Jews"" were ""nothing short of shocking and reprehensible"". Demonstrations have been temporarily banned in Amsterdam until Thursday, although a pro-Palestinian protest has been allowed to go ahead in a park away from the centre. Activists want another protest to take place outside Amsterdam city hall. Dozens detained after protesters defy ban in AmsterdamWe must not turn blind eye to antisemitism, says Dutch king'They shouted Jewish, IDF': Israeli football fans describe attackLast week, youths on scooters criss-crossed the Dutch capital in ""hit-and-run"" attacks on Maccabi supporters after the Europa League match, authorities said. Five people were treated in hospital and others suffered minor injuries. The five new arrests come on top of 63 announced by the authorities since the violence. One of the five was released from custody but remains a suspect. Police also made several arrests after the new unrest in the city on Monday. No injuries were reported. Dozens of youths dressed in black damaged cars in a western suburb, where the tram was attacked on '40-'45 Square. Videos posted on social media show a tram being attacked with fireworks and its windows being shattered. A fire on the tram was quickly extinguished and riot officers cleared the square, making arrests, the ANP news agency reported. A police car was set alight elsewhere. Schoof promised that the Netherlands would focus on bringing perpetrators of Thursday's violence to justice. ""The images and reports for Amsterdam and what we've seen this weekend of antisemitic attacks against Israelis and Jews are nothing short of shocking and reprehensible,"" he told journalists. He also commented on reports that Maccabi supporters had attacked a taxi and burnt a Palestinian flag in Amsterdam, as well as chanting anti-Arab slogans. ""We are well aware of what happened earlier with Maccabi supporters but we think that's of a different category and we condemn any violence as well, but that is no excuse whatsoever for what happened later on that night in the attacks on Jews in Amsterdam,"" he said. The broader ban on pro-Palestinian protests has angered activists. Some have argued that they should be free to voice their disapproval of Israel's actions in Gaza and the actions of the Maccabi supporters. Police chief Peter Holla said there had been incidents ""on both sides"" during Thursday's clashes. In a separate development, Maccabi Tel Aviv's Europa League tie on 28 November has been moved from Istanbul to the Hungarian city of Debrecen. European football's governing body Uefa said the match with Besiktas would be played behind closed doors following a decision by Hungarian authorities. The violence in Amsterdam last week was condemned by leaders across Europe, the US and Israel. For many, it was especially shocking coming on the eve of commemorations marking the November 1938 Nazi pogroms against German Jews. Three-quarters of Jewish people in the Netherlands were murdered during the Holocaust in World War Two. Reports of antisemitic incidents in Europe have risen since the start of the war in Gaza just over a year ago.

The multi-storey block in Bachoura housed a Hezbollah-affiliated health centre, which Israel's military said was hit in a ""precision"" attack. This is the first Israeli strike close to Beirut's centre - just metres away from Lebanon's parliament. There were five other air strikes overnight against targets in the southern suburb of Dahieh. It comes after the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said eight soldiers had been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, its first losses since the start of ground operations against the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Hezbollah said it had destroyed Israeli tanks during the fighting and insisted it had enough men and ammunition to push back the forces. Earlier, the IDF announced that more infantry and armoured troops had joined the operation seeking to dismantle what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanese border villages. In the latest overnight strikes, three explosions were heard in Dahieh, in the city's southern suburbs - with a fourth closer to the centre. There were two further air strikes in Dahieh, which came after the IDF warned people living nearby that it was targeting what it said were facilities belonging to Hezbollah in the area of the city known to be its stronghold. Before the overnight air strikes, Lebanon's health ministry said 46 people had been killed and 85 wounded in Israeli bombings in the last 24 hours, without differentiating between civilians and combatants. A number of those killed in the central Beirut strike were rescue officers and paramedics, according to Beirut's civil defence. It also emerged a US permanent resident from the state of Michigan was among those killed in recent Israeli air strikes on Lebanon. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, 56, was in the country to care for his elderly mother, according to The Detroit News. His death was confirmed by a White House official, who said: ""His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon. ""Hezbollah has been weakened after two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks that have killed more than 1,200 people across Lebanon and displaced around 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. On the second full day of their ground invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that soldiers backed by aircraft had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Most were commandos from the elite Egoz and Golani Reconnaissance units. Hezbollah said its fighters had fired ani-tank missiles at Israeli commandos, killing and wounding dozens during clashes early on Wednesday in one border village. It also said that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, and that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras. Hezbollah has spent years building infrastructure in southern Lebanon that includes extensive underground tunnels. It also has thousands of fighters, who know the area well. Paying tribute to the eight soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had fallen ”in the midst of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us”. “This will not happen, because we will stand together, and with God’s help, we will win together,” he added. Israeli air defences were also in action again a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the Israeli air strike in Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout Wednesday, according to the IDF. Netanyahu insists that the ground offensive in Lebanon will degrade Hezbollah’s capability and push its fighters back, eventually allowing about 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes near the border. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden said he did not support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites. He added that the US ""will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do"" in response to the Iranian barrage.",Nine killed in Israeli air strike on central Beirut,Nine killed in Israeli air strike on central Beirut,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rd0gnv68jo,articles/article_3202.txt,results/article_3202.txt.json

On Thursday, two UN peacekeepers from Indonesia were wounded falling from an observation tower in Naqoura after an Israeli tank fired towards it. Two other peacekeepers were injured in a separate explosion which the Israeli military (IDF) has said it is investigating. Last week, the Israeli military asked the UN to prepare to pull back from the border - something Unifil (the United Nations Interim Force) has refused to do. IDF Spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the military was in an ""ongoing conflict with Hezbollah whose terrorists and infrastructure are in close proximity to Unifil positions posing a significant risk to the safety of peacekeepers"". ""The IDF takes every precaution to minimize harm to civilians and peacekeepers alike,"" he added. UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said firing on peacekeepers was a “violation of international humanitarian law”. ""These peacekeepers must be protected,"" he said. Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for Unifil, said recent attacks on UN bases look like ""more of a deliberate attack against our troops, who have been in the south to try to bring back stability"". Asked about the attacks, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was ""vital that peacekeepers and civilians are protected” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire.

3204,2024-11-22 15:54:42.870000+00:00,/news/articles/cjr4gvydxeno,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK, after an international arrest warrant was issued for him, Downing Street has indicated. A No 10 spokesman refused to comment on the specific case but said the government would fulfil its ""legal obligations"". On Thursday the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, along with Israel's former defence minister Yoav Gallant, over alleged war crimes in Gaza. The court's member countries, including the UK, have signed a treaty that obliges them to act on arrest warrants. Asked whether Netanyahu would be detained if he entered the UK, the prime minister's official spokesman refused to comment on ""hypotheticals"". However, he added: ""The government would fulfil its obligations under the act and indeed its legal obligations. ""This refers to the International Criminal Court Act 2001, which states that if the court issues a warrant for arrest, a designated minister ""shall transmit the request… to an appropriate judicial officer"", who, if satisfied the warrant appears to have been issued by the ICC,  ""shall endorse the warrant for execution in the United Kingdom"". The PM's spokesman confirmed the government stands by the process outlined in the act and would ""always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law"". He was unable to confirm which secretary of state would be involved in the process and did not answer questions about whether the government was seeking legal advice from Attorney General Lord Hermer - the UK's top lawyer - in relation to the case. Generally, arrest warrants and extradition requests  from around the world must be sent to a special team in the Home Office for basic checks before they are acted on. The UK’s legislation on the ICC says that the courts have the final say on whether an arrest and “delivery” of a suspect should go ahead. Asked whether the PM was still willing to talk to Netanyahu, the PM's spokesman said it was ""obviously important that we have a dialogue with Israel on all levels"", describing the country as ""a key partner across a range of areas"".  Last month Lord Hermer told the BBC he would not allow political considerations to influence his conclusions if the ICC were to issue an arrest warrant. ""My advice [on an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu] would be legal advice, based on analysis of the law,"" he said. ""It's not for the attorney to dictate what a government chooses to do. The role of the attorney is to provide fearless legal advice as to what the law requires, what the contents of the law is, and where the law takes you. And that's what I'm going to do. ""Following the arrest warrants being issued on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK government respected the ICC's independence and remained focused on pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was killed in July, over alleged war crimes in relation to the 7 October 2023 attacks against Israel. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticised the ICC for drawing a ""moral equivalence"" between Israel's actions in Gaza and the 7 October attacks. She called on the government to ""condemn and challenge"" the court's decision, describing it as ""concerning and provocative"". After winning power, the new Labour government scrapped its predecessor's plan to challenge the right of the ICC to issue arrest warrants, saying it was a matter for the judges to decide. The impact of the warrants will depend on whether the court's 124 member states - which do not include Israel or its ally, the US - decide to enforce them or not. US President Joe Biden has called the arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister ""outrageous"", saying there is ""no equivalence"" between Israel and Hamas. However, officials from a number of European countries have made statements standing by the court and said they would implement its decision. Both Israel and Hamas reject the allegations made by the ICC, with Netanyahu branding the warrant ""antisemitic"". Netanyahu condemned the ICC’s decision as “antisemitic”. Hamas made no mention of the warrant for Deif but welcomed the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot has told the BBC that the ICC’s decision “is the formalisation of an accusation, it is by no means a judgement”. He told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show: “We also say that we’ve condemned, in [the] strongest possible terms, the fact that humanitarian help has not been able to reach civil populations in Gaza while the situation is catastrophic. “But in no way do we draw any form of equivalence between the Hamas leaders that have been targeted by arrest warrants by the ICC and the government of Israel. ”",No 10 indicates Netanyahu faces arrest if he enters UK,No 10 indicates Netanyahu faces arrest if he enters UK,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjr4gvydxeno,articles/article_3204.txt,results/article_3204.txt.json

""He understands the language of the Middle East. ""Iran will think twice about doing anything. I think if Kamala had been elected, there wouldn't be much fear in the Middle East of attacking America or Israel. ""Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was one of the first to congratulate the new president-elect on Wednesday morning. ""Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!"" he tweeted. Netanyahu has previously called Trump the ""best friend Israel has ever had in the White House"". Trump previously won favour here by scrapping an Iran nuclear deal that Israel opposed, brokering historic normalisation agreements with several Arab countries and upending decades of US policy - and international consensus - by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Donald Trump's first term in office was ""exemplary"" as far as Israel is concerned, said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the US. ""The hope is that he'll revisit that. [But] we have to be very clear-sighted about who Donald Trump is and what he stands for. ""Firstly, he said, the former president ""doesn't like wars"", seeing them as expensive.  Trump has urged Israel to finish the war in Gaza quickly. He's also ""not a big fan"" of Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank, said Amb Oren, and has opposed the wishes of some Israeli leaders to annex parts of it. Both those policies could put him in conflict with far-right parties in Netanyahu's current governing coalition, who have threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister pursues policies they reject. Seven things Trump says he will do in powerWhat Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China When called upon to choose between the recent demands of his US ally and the demands of his coalition partners, Benjamin Netanyahu has tended to choose his coalition. Friction with the current US President, Joe Biden, has grown sharply as a result. Michael Oren believes Netanyahu will need to take a different approach with the incoming president. ""If Donald Trump comes into office in January and says, 'OK, you have a week to finish this war,' Netanyahu is going to have to respect that. ""In Gaza, where the Israeli military has been battling Palestinian group Hamas, desperation has narrowed the focus of some residents to that single goal. Trump ""has some strong promises"", Ahmed said.  ""We hope he can help and bring peace. ""Ahmed's wife and son were both killed in the war and his house destroyed. ""Enough is enough, we are tired,"" he said. ""We hope Trump is strong so that he can resolve this issue with Israel. "" Mohammed Dawoud, displaced eight times during the Gaza conflict, said a Trump victory meant that the end of the war would come soon. Another displaced resident, Mamdouh, said he didn't care who won - he just wanted someone to help. ""There’s no medicine, no hospitals, no food. There’s nothing left in Gaza,"" he said. ""We want someone strong who can separate us and the Jews. ""The view from countries where Trump's win really mattersIn the occupied West Bank, home of the Palestinian Authority (PA), there is widespread scepticism about American influence, with many viewing US administrations from both sides of the political aisle as siding with Israel. ""Mediocre solutions which come at the expense of the Palestinians, or endless military support for Israel, is going to be nothing but a catalyst for future confrontations,"" said Sabri Saidam, a senior member of the PA's main faction, Fatah. ""We would like to see a new version of Trump, more like a Trump 2.0 who's serious about immediately ending the war, and addressing the root cause of conflict in the Middle East. ""Recent polls suggested that more than two-thirds of Israelis wanted to see Trump back in the White House. But here too, there are those who caution about his unpredictability and his approach.

But it could also be harder for Netanyahu to navigate the demands and compromises involved in those regional goals.

3207,2024-10-23 17:39:38.736000+00:00,/news/articles/c3e8j5lv1ygo,"UN agencies say they have postponed an emergency polio vaccination campaign in northern Gaza due to intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access. The final phase of the two-stage rollout - prompted by Gaza’s first case of polio in 25 years, which left a baby boy paralyzed - was due to begin on Wednesday. Almost 120,000 children in northern Gaza had been expected to receive a second dose of the oral polio vaccine. But Israel’s military has been carrying out a new offensive in the Jabalia area, saying that it is acting against regrouping Hamas fighters. More than 400 people are reported to have been killed and 60,000 others have been displaced since the offensive started two weeks ago. Residents unwilling or unable to comply with Israeli evacuation orders are said to be living in increasingly desperate conditions, with food and other essential supplies running out. From the start of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, medical experts stressed that delays in administering the second dose could jeopardise overall efforts to halt transmission of the contagious, potentially deadly disease. For herd immunity to work, at least 90% of all children in every community and neighbourhood need to be given a minimum of two doses. The first round of the vaccine campaign successfully reached 559,000 children under 10 years of age over three phases in southern, central and northern Gaza between 1 and 12 September, during which there were local “humanitarian pauses” agreed by Israel and Palestinian groups. Following the start of the second round on 14 October, more than 442,000 children in central and southern areas received the second dose - 94% of the target in those areas. However, UN agencies said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they had been compelled to postpone the third phase to vaccinate 119,000 children across the north. “The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,” it said. “All logistics, supplies and trained human resources were prepared,” they added. “However, given that the area currently approved for temporary humanitarian pauses was substantially reduced - now limited only to Gaza City, a significant decrease from the first round - many children in northern Gaza would have missed out on the polio vaccine dose. ”The UN agencies said it was crucial for the vaccine campaign in the north to be facilitated through the implementation of humanitarian pauses that would ensure access for wherever children are located. The Israeli military body in charge of co-ordinating aid shipments to Gaza, Cogat, said the vaccination campaign would begin in the coming days. “We will continue to facilitate an effective vaccination campaign against polio across Gaza,” it added. The World Health Organization’s representative in Gaza also told the BBC that he was hopeful that the campaign would start within the next week. “We cannot stop this now. We are almost there,” Dr Richard Peeperkorn said. He also described how he had witnessed “enormous destruction” and “active bombardment all over the place” earlier this week during a WHO mission to evacuate 14 patients from Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, one of the two minimally functional hospitals near Jabalia. “We had to stay overnight at Kamal Adwan. There was intense bombardment in the vicinity of the hospital. What these patients go through every night,” he said. “I could already see that we could not do a polio vaccine campaign in those conditions, in that environment. Parents would not be able to bring their children, teams would not be able to move around. ”Dr Peeperkorn said the hospital had received hundreds of injured people and many dead bodies over the last couple of days. On Wednesday morning, the Israeli military said its troops had killed ""numerous terrorists"" and located weapons during continuing operations in the Jabalia area. It also said the troops had ""apprehended dozens of terror operatives while facilitating the safe evacuation of thousands of civilians"". Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency meanwhile said its rescue workers had recovered the bodies of two people from a building destroyed in an Israeli strike in the Beit Lahia Project area overnight. Two children and their mother were also killed at a home in al-Zarqa area, north of Gaza City, it added. Later on Wednesday, the Civil Defence reported that a number of people were killed in a strike on school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City. Graphic video posted online appeared to show the bodies of several men lying in the courtyard of al-Zahraa school. The Israeli military said it had conducted “a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control centre”.

""Skin infections, upper respiratory tract infections - sadly these are simple things to treat but currently we just don't have the medication to treat these,"" she said. Dr Frost, who is running the hospital for the charity UK-Med, said she had previously worked in challenging humanitarian contexts, but ""never have I had such a lack of basic items needed to be a doctor"". She said gloves and dressing are in ""chronic short supply"", and there is also a ""severe lack of medication"". Her hospital also operates a weekly malnutrition clinic for babies and young children, but said the ""number of severely malnourished children is rising"" each week. ""The management of such cases is complex and we really don't have the resources to manage these effectively,"" she said. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, leaving around 1,200 people dead and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas in response, launching a ground offensive in the enclave. At least 42,603 ​people have been killed and 99,795 injured in Gaza since the war began last October, the Hamas-run authorities say. The ministry's figures for the number of people killed do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Dr Frost said security is a ""huge concern"", and that her hospital had treated people injured in air strikes. ""Nowhere is safe in Gaza now. A few days ago a stray bullet entered our female ward.

3209,2024-10-03 15:41:26.276000+00:00,/news/articles/cx250ygn9ddo,"The price of oil has jumped 5% after US President Joe Biden said the US was discussing possible strikes by Israel on Iran’s oil industry. Asked on a visit if he would support Israel striking Iran’s oil facilities, Biden said: “We’re discussing that. ""Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, exporting around half its production abroad, mainly to China. Since Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Monday, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil has risen 10% to $77 a barrel, although this remains below levels seen earlier this year. Any extended rise in energy prices raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and increased gas and electricity bills, pushing up the rate of inflation. So far this year, weaker demand from China and ample supply from Saudi Arabia have acted to hold down oil prices. The reaction in oil markets has, so far, been far more muted than, for example, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the escalation of violence in the Middle East and threat of further action is now stalking the markets. Of particular concern is whether any escalation could block the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of oil tanker traffic and a fifth of LNG frozen gas has to pass. Since Russia’s war with Ukraine began, the world has become more dependent on shipped frozen gas in LNG tankers. Even if it is Asia that is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, the immediate price impact of such developments would be significant. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Thursday of the “very serious” potential impact and that he was watching developments “extremely closely”. All this could come at the very moment the world’s central bankers declared a quiet victory over the three-year inflation shock from the pandemic and Ukraine war. It may help explain why G7 leaders are trying to moderate the expected response from Israel to Iran’s attack.",Oil price rise comes at a critical point,Oil price rise comes at a critical point,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx250ygn9ddo,articles/article_3209.txt,results/article_3209.txt.json

""A truck hit dozens of people who had disembarked at a bus stop. Eight of the wounded were trapped under the truck and others were lying and walking near it,” a medic for Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Many of the injured were reportedly pensioners on a day trip to a nearby museum. The driver of the truck, named as Rami Natur, an Arab Israeli from the town of Qalansawe in central Israel, was shot dead by a civilian at the scene.  Emergency services were called to the Glilot Junction around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Sunday following reports of a truck ramming. Yechiel Ben Moshe told the Ynet website: ""We were a group of retirees going to Glilot to visit a museum and listen to a lecture. """"The bus parked, and people got off. A truck came from behind and I heard a huge noise from the truck. ""It drove toward us to run us over. ""Around me, everyone was injured and bleeding, and others were in shock.

In a video statement, Dr Khalil Daqran urged international organisations to send medical staff to the hospital in the north of the strip, saying patients there were bleeding to death for lack of proper care. On Monday, Israel said its forces had detained about 100 ""terrorists"" at the hospital before withdrawing. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the hospital, inside Jabalia refugee camp, had been used by Hamas - claims denied by local health officials.  Mr Daqran said: ""Two days ago, the army stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, causing widespread destruction: setting large parts on fire, destroying the hospital’s entrances, and demolishing surrounding walls. ""Patients and medical staff were assaulted, with many patients and companions arrested, along with most of the medical staff. ""The fate of 30 medical personnel remains unknown. ""The army has removed the hospital from service entirely, destroying all its contents. There are now no medicines, medical supplies or food within the hospital. ""The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had completed a ""precise operation against a Hamas terrorist stronghold"" in the hospital. The IDF said it had taken steps to minimise civilian casualties and facilitated the evacuation of the hospital. It added that troops found weapons, cash and documents belonging to Hamas during the raid. Some Hamas militants, including some linked to last year's 7 October attacks, disguised themselves as medical staff, the IDF said. The Israeli raid injured medics and killed patients at the hospital, health officials said. The Israeli army published a video purporting to show the interrogation of an ambulance driver who had worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital. In the video, the authenticity of which could not be verified by the BBC, the alleged driver's face is blurred. The man says Hamas militants operated in the hospital. He says Hamas used ambulances to transport militants to their missions and adds: ""We have had enough. [Hamas] are stationed in the hospitals, stationed in the schools. "" The northern Gaza Strip is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of civilians living in increasingly desperate conditions. Mr Daqran said: ""Conditions in northern Gaza are catastrophic: there is no water, food or baby formula. Infrastructure has been decimated, sewage and waste are piling up among the residents, leading to the spread of disease and epidemics. "" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that ""the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation"". ""The Israeli government’s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,"" Mr Türk added. He also said it was unacceptable that Palestinian armed groups were reportedly operating among civilians, including inside shelters for the displaced, and putting them in harm’s way. Many Palestinians believe the Israeli military is implementing out the so-called “Generals’ Plan” in the north, which would see the forced displacement of all of the estimated 400,000 civilians there to the south followed by a siege of any remaining Hamas fighters. The Israeli military has denied having such a plan and says it is making sure that civilians get out of harm’s way. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",One medic left at Gaza hospital as Israel says it arrested ‘100 terrorists’,One medic left at Gaza hospital as Israel says it arrested ‘100 terrorists’,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c245n75587vo,articles/article_3211.txt,results/article_3211.txt.json
3212,2024-09-24 12:54:57.436000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y8gv1d8j8o,"The war in Gaza always had the capacity to spread. Near-daily rocket attacks in and around northern Israel by Hezbollah, Hamas's Lebanese allies, and air strikes by Israel have displaced tens of thousands of civilians on either side of the border. But until recently, the smart money was on both Israel and Hezbollah avoiding full escalation. That money isn't looking so smart today. Last week's extraordinary targeting of thousands of Hezbollah operatives through their pagers and walkie-talkies seems to have altered the calculus. Israel is believed to have been behind this attack - so why might it have carried out this operation, and why last week? What does it say about how modern wars are conducted? And what can we expect to happen in the weeks to come - how likely is a ground war between Israel and Hezbollah?First of all, it’s important to understand exactly what Hezbollah is and where it comes from. The group came into existence in the early 1980s after Israel occupied southern Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. At first Hezbollah presented itself as a resistance group against Israel and the voice of Lebanon’s Shia community, says Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East Institute at SOAS University of London. The Briefing Room: Lebanon attacksHow do the attacks alter the equation in the Middle East? David Aaronovitch and guests discuss the recent events in Lebanon. Listen now on BBC Sounds But when Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah kept its weapons in violation of a UN resolution requiring it to disarm. It continued to present itself as a necessary force for the defence of Lebanon and “became the country's most powerful political actor”, says Prof Khatib. Although it is represented in Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah’s real power lies behind the scenes, she adds - as an armed group that many analysts say is more powerful than the Lebanese army, it has the ability to intimidate its opponents. “It is able to set the foreign policy agenda for Lebanon to a large extent, as well as declare war, basically, on behalf of Lebanon,” says Prof Khatib. Hezbollah is also aligned with Iran - the group’s “principal armourer”, according to Shashank Joshi, The Economist's defence editor. “There isn't simply a sort of immediate direct command, but they are very, very closely tied in aims and in practices. ” Live updates: Israel strikes dozens more sites in southern Lebanon'We just had to flee': Fear and tension in LebanonBowen: Israel believes it has weakened Hezbollah but escalation riskyCold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflictDeadliest day in years for Lebanon as Israel steps up strikes on Hezbollah The rubric that we're supposed to use when we discuss these attacks is that Israel is believed to have carried them out because Israel has not confirmed that it did so - a long-standing policy on the part of Israeli officials. When operations take place in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, “they tend to put their hands up but they don’t when it’s Lebanon or Iran”, says Ronen Bergman, an Israeli investigative journalist with the New York Times. However, the attacks are widely cited as having been carried out by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service. Unlike other such agencies around the world, Mossad’s role is not just restricted to intelligence gathering, according to Bergman. Mossad also sees it as its duty to “translate the intelligence it collects into what they call kinetic or aggressive or physical operations”, he says, including “explosives, sabotage, targeted killings”. A week has now passed since the pager attacks. And the day after, the walkie-talkies were targeted too. So what do we know about these attacks? According to Joshi, it looks to have been a supply-chain attack in which Mossad set up front companies that look to have manufactured real pagers for some time. And when it came to this consignment bound for Hezbollah, it seems that Mossad placed explosives inside the devices that they were then subsequently able to remotely trigger. In 2018, Bergman says, a young intelligence officer found out that Hezbollah had started using pagers and came up with the idea of Mossad infiltrating their supply chain. Some 4,500 booby-trapped devices were then supplied to Hezbollah, Bergman adds. There are some accounts that suggest Mossad knew where these pagers were and who was in possession of them before detonating them. However, Joshi is sceptical of these claims. He says, too, that “this was not some magical cyber-attack in which the batteries spontaneously combusted by some clever bit of code as people may initially have thought or suspected”. CCTV footage of the pagers going off were broadcast around the world. The images were shocking - and they also tell us a great deal about Hezbollah's organisation and structure, says Prof Khatib. Typically, the group operates with a high degree of secrecy, she says: “Not all its members are known, sometimes even to their own families. ”What the attacks have done, then, is expose who paid members of Hezbollah actually were. That information, she says, has already proved useful to Israel. In one case, “one of the people who ended up in hospital was later visited by someone, and that person as a visitor was later tracked by Israel, leading them to find out where the leaders of Hezbollah were meeting on the Friday that came after the attack”, Prof Khatib adds. Those commanders were later targeted by an Israeli strike, she adds. To some the attacks will have looked like a new type of warfare. Joshi, however, is not so sure. “It’s always been possible if you wanted to put explosives inside a phone, a pager, inside a banana, if you feel like it. The point is to what end?”He says the Americans had contemplated carrying out similar attacks in the past, but had shied away because of the potential implications. After all, everybody now knows that Israel is capable of such an operation and can therefore take steps to prevent another one in future - taking apart devices and checking them for explosives, for instance. As a result, he says, “my suggestion is that we're not going to see many attacks like this”. The implication is that this was a one-off, use-it-or-lose-it situation - once you've carried out an operation like this, you can't do so again. For this reason, Bergman says there are divisions within Israel’s hierarchy about whether this was the right time to do it. “The timing of the attack is interesting,” says Bergman. “There are a lot of people in the defence establishment who are furious because they said this button was not supposed to be pushed here and now. ”All this raises the question of what Israel was thinking. Previously, many had thought that Israel was avoiding full-blown conflict with Hezbollah and didn't want war on two fronts while it was fighting in Gaza. The attacks might indicate that this calculation has changed. But Bergman says it remains the case that most of the Israel Defence Force’s generals, including its chief of staff, oppose a ground invasion of Lebanon - conscious from their experience during the occupation in the 1980s and 90s that it could be a “death trap”. He suggests that the aim was to force Hezbollah’s secretary general Hassan Nasrallah to agree to a ceasefire without Israel ending the war in Gaza. Nasrallah has promised that he will not end his solidarity with Hamas until Israel ends its war in Gaza, says Bergman, while “Prime Minister Netanyahu, for his coalition integrity, doesn't want to end the war with Hamas”. The calculation, then, was that the pager and walkie-talkie attacks would shift the balance, allowing the IDF to focus on Gaza. “Of course, the risk of this is that it will lead to the other way - it will lead, instead of a ceasefire and a political solution, to an all-out war,” says Bergman. Prof Khatib says it would be “completely foolish” of Israel to attempt a ground invasion of southern Lebanon - Hezbollah is well-prepared, with long experience of ground warfare. But Joshi says it remains a risk. Recent air strikes against Hezbollah arms depots as well as the attacks themselves on the group’s leadership are “all the kinds of things you would need to be doing ahead of a major ground campaign inside Lebanon”. That brings us to the question of whether Hezbollah's capacity has been so degraded in recent weeks and its confidence so undermined that actually it isn't in a position to fight an all-out war. Joshi says that Hezbollah has taken a “battering”, having seen much of its leadership wiped out. “However, I think it would be a grave mistake to think it doesn't have considerable missile power at its disposal. ”The thousands of Hezbollah rockets aimed at Tel Aviv and Haifa and other Israeli towns and cities represent a major reason why Israel might not want to engage in an all-out war, as do the thousands of residents of northern Israel who have already been evacuated from their homes because of the cross-border fighting. “The people who have remained are the people who probably don't have the means to flee,” says Prof Khatib. “But certainly things don't seem to be calming down anytime soon. ”Top Image: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Hezbollah relies heavily on pagers for the group’s communications. Mobile phones have long since been abandoned as simply too vulnerable - as Israel’s assassination of a Hamas bombmaker demonstrated as long ago as 1996. But today’s attacks were terrifying in their scope. Hezbollah members were blown up in supermarkets, on the street, in their cars, at home, next to their children. Incidents were reported from all across Lebanon, from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley. Even from neighbouring Syria. Iranian state TV confirmed that Tehran’s ambassador in Lebanon was among those injured. Each explosion may have been small, but some resulted in catastrophic injuries. One particularly graphic image showed a lifeless young man slumped in a barber’s chair, his face bloodied. LIVE: Latest updates on the Hezbollah pager explosionsWhat we know about the attack in LebanonWatch: Video appears to show explosion at supermarketBowen: Tactical triumph for Israel, but Hezbollah won't be deterredWhat is Hezbollah in Lebanon and why is it fighting with Israel? At a time when Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a low-level war for almost a year, these attacks will have devastating consequences for Hezbollah’s manpower, communications and morale. Israel has yet to comment, but this was undoubtedly its work - no other group or country has the motivation or capacity to do something like this. It is the latest in a series of sophisticated military and undercover operations that have included, since mid-July, a long-range air raid in Yemen, as well as assassinations in Beirut and Tehran. Do the pager attacks herald a larger Israeli operation?With large numbers of Hezbollah's personnel now injured and its vital communication network massively - and embarrassingly - disrupted, this would clearly be a tempting moment for Israel to take advantage. Israeli leaders have been signalling, in recent days, their desire to alter the military status quo along the Lebanese border. On Sunday, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel needed “a change in the balance of power on our northern border"". Tens of thousands of Israeli citizens have spent most of a year away from their homes. Israel ordered an evacuation of vulnerable northern communities when Hezbollah started firing rockets into northern Israel, soon after the Gaza war began. Months of retaliatory Israeli air strikes have also forced huge numbers of Lebanese civilians to abandon their homes. On Monday, Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, both warned a visiting US official that Israel was prepared to do whatever it took to ensure its security. For the first time, the government also said its Gaza war aims included allowing Israelis to return to their homes, raising the spectre of a wider conflict, possibly involving a limited ground invasion to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. There are no signs yet of the sort of build up of men and armour that would be needed for a major military incursion, but today’s attacks represent yet another dangerous escalation.

3215,2024-08-11 09:12:53.195000+00:00,/news/articles/cy68g5zz1wjo,"It was 07:30 in the morning in late January when Khaled Ifranji received the phone call he had always feared. He had just passed through an Israeli military checkpoint on his way from his home in occupied East Jerusalem to his work in the occupied West Bank, when one of his employees rang to say the Israeli army was ""demolishing the stables"". Khaled had spent the last seven years building the Palestine Equestrian Club - pouring all his money and every waking hour into the project. The club was built on West Bank land in the Palestinian territories, but in an area which is under full Israeli control. When Khaled arrived, it was a scene of destruction. There were four diggers demolishing everything. Khaled says his first concern was that there were still horses inside the stables. A video he shared with the BBC shows a digger striking a building while horses can be seen inside. When the horses were eventually released, they ran scared across the hillside. Khaled says one was hit by a car. Khaled asked the soldiers, “Why are you destroying my place?” He says they ignored him. He told them they should be thanking him for the work he does with Palestinian children. “I take away their anger…There’s no guns here. Just sport. ”The Israeli army has confirmed to the BBC the demolition took place on 30 January but disputes Khaled's allegation that horses were still inside when it happened, despite the video evidence. They said Israeli security forces and civil administration officials had “removed all the equipment from the compound and evacuated approximately 20 horses”. They also said the structures had been built illegally, but many Palestinians, like Khaled, say permits are impossible to obtain in this part of the West Bank. Khaled, who has ridden horses for nearly 30 years, was once a member of the Palestine Equestrian Team, and competed both locally and internationally. “There's a connection that can be established between you and horses, often deeper than those formed with humans,” he says. At the time of its demolition, the equestrian club was just beginning to reach a point Khaled was happy with. He and his team had built a watering system and many of the 30 horses had their own individual stables. They had constructed two arenas, a cafe and a toilet block and the centre was being powered by solar panels and was beginning to be profitable. One of his younger clients - Shams - has been riding since she was six years old and training with Khaled for nine months now. “This place is home for me,"" she says. ""When I’m riding Calypso I feel freedom. The second I ride on him every single stress I have is gone. ”When Shams’ father told her that the centre had been demolished, she was terrified for Calypso. “I was scared…We have such a strong connection. He’s my whole world. ” The stables were built on a desolate hill a few kilometres south of Ramallah, the Palestinian administrative capital of the West Bank. It sits out on its own, not close to anything, a feeling of no-man’s land. As part of the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, occupied West Bank land was split into three categories - Area A under full Palestinian control, Area B under partial Palestinian control and Area C under full Israeli control. Khaled's equestrian club is located in Area C, which makes up 60% of the West Bank. This agreement was supposed to be temporary, but nearly 30 years later it seems to have cemented an Israeli presence. The Israeli military continues to operate in all areas of the West Bank and settlements have expanded throughout the territory, something most of the international community considers an obstacle to peace and in contravention of international law. In July, anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now revealed Israel had approved the advance of plans for 5,295 new homes in 12 West Bank settlements as well a seizure of 5 sq miles of West Bank land, making it one of the largest land seizures in 30 years. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its ""illegal"" occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a ""decision of lies"". Khaled says Area C is the only place where there is enough space to build something like his club, away from built up areas of cities. Despite renting the land from the Palestinian ministry of religious affairs, he has been unable to get a permit to build as this is controlled by Israel. In a statement to the BBC, a representative of Cogat, the military division that co-ordinates Israeli government activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, described the demolition of the centre as an “enforcement operation… on a spot where an order forbade construction” and that Khaled’s buildings were in an area “designated as an archaeological site”. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says it's ""virtually impossible"", external for Palestinians to obtain building permits, with Peace Now saying that between 2009 and 2018 only 2% of all such requests were permitted in Area C. This means it is not uncommon for Palestinians to build without an Israeli issued building permit. Many of these unauthorised buildings are at risk of Israeli demolitions. In 2023, Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem logged 554 demolitions of Palestinian houses and structures in the West Bank. Shai Parnes, a spokesperson for the group, said: “Israel’s planning and building policy in the West Bank is aimed at preventing Palestinian development and dispossessing Palestinians of their land. ” The relevant Israeli authority did not respond to this specific allegation. Just a few days after the demolition, Khaled’s friends at the club threw a birthday party for him amongst the wreckage as they began to clear the destruction. It was there and then that they decided they would rebuild. A crowdfunder was quickly set up to raise money for new, temporary structures. “They began saying to me, ‘We want to build a better club. . . They demolished this place so we can build a new club even more beautiful than before. '""Part of Khaled’s busy summer programme involves running activities for kids from low-income families, as well as children with learning difficulties. Khaled is determined that these sessions will go ahead using the rudimentary structures and arenas they have begun to rebuild. But as well as this they have had to think of new solutions in case the Israeli authorities do come to demolish again. Thirty-year-old Reem, who runs the club’s café, has had to improvise. After the demolition of the cafeteria in January, she came up with a plan to set up a café on wheels, “something mobile that can move from place to place, minimising our losses in case they… demolish the place again”, she says. With Calypso now safely back in the stables, Shams is undeterred by what has happened and has big ambitions. “I want to compete in the Olympics for Palestine,” she says. Khaled continues to coach Palestinian children and is determined to stay on this piece of land whatever happens. “There is nothing left for me to lose"" he says. ""If they destroy it today, I will build again tomorrow. If they destroy it tomorrow I will build again the next day. This is my life. I have to continue. ”",Palestinian horse centre vows to rebuild after West Bank demolition,Palestinian horse centre vows to rebuild after West Bank demolition,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy68g5zz1wjo,articles/article_3215.txt,results/article_3215.txt.json
3216,2024-08-16 01:16:34.877000+00:00,/news/articles/c623zkwd04qo,"A Palestinian man was shot dead as dozens of Israeli settlers attacked a village in the north of the occupied West Bank overnight, setting fire to houses and cars, Palestinian officials say. The settlers - some wearing masks - also threw rocks and Molotov cocktails in the village of Jit, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that one was arrested. The Palestinian health ministry said Rashid Sedda, 22, was killed by gunfire from the settlers and another man was seriously wounded in what it condemned as an act of “organised state terrorism”. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of a fatality. Israel’s prime minister said he viewed the incident with “utmost severity”. It is the latest in the series of attacks by extremist settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where there has been a spike in violence since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Footage shared on social media showed cars and houses ablaze following the deadly rampage in Jit on Thursday night. As he inspected the damage to his home on Friday morning, Ibrahim al-Seda told the BBC he had been sitting outside his home with relatives after the sunset Maghrib prayer when he heard a crash. “We looked out and saw seven, eight, maybe 10 settlers. Two cars were set on fire,” he said. “My children ran outside, and we grabbed the hose to try to put out the fire on the cars. But the water wasn’t enough; we couldn’t extinguish the flames. Then they started throwing rocks from above. ”“The people from the town came to defend us and our neighbourhood. Then more settlers arrived, this time armed. They started shooting. ”He added: “Young men who were defending us from above the wall threw stones to protect themselves. We were outnumbered. There were probably around 100 settlers by the end. The people who were down below had to run away because they couldn’t stand against the gunfire. “The settlers took control of the area. They set two more cars on fire and prevented us from going outside because they would shoot anyone who tried. ”Mr Seda said Israeli soldiers arrived “about an hour later” and that they fired shots into the air but “didn’t intervene much at that point just to stop what was going on”. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medics had treated a Palestinian villager who was shot in the chest and rushed him to the Rafida Government Hospital in the nearby city of Nablus, where his condition was described as critical, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Rashid Sedda’s body was also taken there. In a statement, the IDF said its forces and Border Police officers were despatched to the village ""within minutes"" of receiving reports of violence. They fired into the air to disperse the crowds and “remove[d] the Israeli civilians”, it added. One person was arrested and transferred to the police for questioning, it added. The IDF said it had opened a joint investigation with the Shin Bet domestic security service and the police following what it called “this serious incident”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that he took “seriously the riots that took place this evening"" and promised that “those responsible for any criminal act will be caught and prosecuted"". President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X: ""This is an extreme minority that harms the law-abiding community of settlers and the settlement as a whole and in the name and status of Israel in the world during a particularly sensitive and difficult period. The US, Israel's main ally, also issued a condemnation, saying that such attacks on Palestinian civilians were “unacceptable and must stop”. “Israeli authorities must take measures to protect all communities from harm, this includes intervening to stop such violence, and holding all perpetrators of such violence to account,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. Palestinian analyst and former Palestinian Authority spokeswoman Nour Odeh told the BBC that such attacks happened ""on a daily basis”. “These condemnations [by Israeli leaders] are viewed as performative by the Palestinian public, because the track record is [that] the investigations go nowhere, nobody is prosecuted, nobody is held to account, and these settlers can count on the full support of members of the government to protect them. ”The UN said on Wednesday that it had recorded around 1,250 attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since 7 October, external. About 120 of those attacks led to people being killed or injured, and 1,000 led to property damage. It also said a total of 594 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - were killed in conflict-related incidents across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, over the same period. At least 577 were killed by Israeli forces and 10 by settlers, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine security forces personnel and five settlers, were also killed by Palestinians in the West Bank, while another 10 Israelis were killed in attacks in Israel by Palestinians from the West Bank, according to the UN.",Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village,Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c623zkwd04qo,articles/article_3216.txt,results/article_3216.txt.json
3217,2024-11-20 05:59:31.188000+00:00,/news/articles/c20gnvz1975o,"On a Thursday afternoon towards the end of last month, a 59-year-old Palestinian woman set out to gather olives on her family’s land near the village of Faqqua, in the north of the occupied West Bank. It was something that Hanan Abu Salameh had done for decades. Within minutes, the mother of seven and grandmother of 14 lay dying in the dust of the olive grove, with a bullet wound in her chest - she’d been shot by an Israeli soldier. Even though the family had co-ordinated their intention to pick olives with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to her son Fares and husband Hossam, the soldier fired several shots as other family members fled for cover. The IDF says it’s investigating the incident, but Hanan’s grieving relatives have little hope or expectation that her killer will be brought to justice. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Harvesting olives is an age-old ritual and also an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but, according to the UN, it is increasingly precarious. Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks, like organised attacks by Israeli settlers seeking to sabotage the olive harvest, along with the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands. “Last year we couldn’t even harvest our olives, except for a very small amount,” says Omar Tanatara, a farmer from the village of Umm Safa. “At one point, the army came, threw the olives we’d already gathered on the ground, and ordered us to go home,” says Omar, who is also a member of the village council. “Some people were even shot at and olives trees were cut down with saws – that’s how we later found them,” adds Omar, as he and other villagers use small hand-held rakes to pull this year’s harvest from their remaining trees while they can. Even when Israeli and international activists accompany villagers to their olive groves, hoping to deter the threat, there’s no guarantee of safety. Zuraya Hadad instinctively winces as we watch a video of the incident in which her ribs were broken by a masked man wielding a large stick. The Israeli peace activist had been helping Palestinian farmers pick their olives when she was assaulted without provocation. Rather than arresting her attacker, Israeli soldiers, who’d accompanied settlers to the site, just told him to move on. “Even when we come to help, it doesn't guarantee that the Palestinians can harvest their olives,” Zuraya tells me as she recovers from her injuries at home. “We try to raise awareness, but in the end it's either the settlers steal the olives or cut the trees, or they remain unpicked and go to waste. ”Land is at the heart of the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians - who controls it and who has access to it. For thousands of Palestinian families and villages, cultivating and harvesting olives is a big part of their economy. But many say that, in recent times, access to trees on their land has been impeded, often violently by Israeli settlers. Hundreds of trees - which can take years to reach fruit-bearing maturity - have been deliberately burned or cut down, says the UN. More than 96,000 dunums (approximately 96 sq km; 37 sq miles) of olive groves in the West Bank also went uncultivated in 2023 because of Israeli restrictions on access for Palestinian farmers. After being gathered by hand, villagers from Umm Safa take sacks full of olives to the nearby factory, where the presses have restarted this season. Olives are the most important agricultural product in the West Bank. In a good year, they're worth more than $70m (£54m) to the Palestinian economy. But income was well down last year and this year will be even worse, says factory owner Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, as even fewer farmers are able to harvest their crop owing to attacks by settlers. “Let me give you an example,” he tells me. “My brother-in-law in Lubban - next to the Israeli settlement - went to pick his own olives, but they broke his arms and they made him leave along with everyone who was with him. ”“We, as Palestinians, don’t have petrol or big companies. Our main agricultural crop is olives,” he adds. “So, like the Gulf depends on oil, and the Americans on business, our economy is dependent on the olive tree. ”On the hill overlooking the olive groves of Umm Safa stands an illegal settler outpost - a farm. The extremist settler who runs it, Zvi Bar Yosef, was sanctioned this year by the UK and other Western governments for repeated acts of violence against Palestinians, including twice threatening families at gunpoint. Over the last year of the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have been emboldened by the support of far-right Israeli ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir. As national security minister, he has given out free firearms to hundreds of settlers and has encouraged them to assert their right to what - they say - is their ""God-given"" land. Ben-Gvir has also been accused of openly supporting the disruption of olive harvesting on Palestinian land. At the olive press, farmers wait patiently in the yard to witness the transformation of the olives they’ve been able to gather this year into ""liquid gold"". The olive tree has been a symbol of this land for centuries. For generations of Palestinians, it is their link to the land - a link that is under threat now more than ever.",Palestinian olive harvest under threat from Israeli attacks and restrictions,Palestinian olive harvest under threat from Israeli attacks and restrictions,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20gnvz1975o,articles/article_3217.txt,results/article_3217.txt.json
3218,2024-10-08 11:40:12.171000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2lg92edj7o,"A Palestinian refugee is taking the Home Office to court to challenge its refusal to let her parents and siblings join her in Scotland. Hadil Louz, 32, lives in Broughty Ferry with her husband Ibrahim and eight-month-old daughter Laila. She has been trying to reunite with her parents and four siblings and earlier this year applied to the Home Office for permission to allow them to join her in the UK. But the Home Office rejected the application and said the family had not demonstrated “circumstances which are so compelling as to make them exceptional”. Ms Louz is now appealing against that decision in the Scottish courts. Campaigners are also calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to those which were previously introduced for people fleeing Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine. Ms Louz, who has been in the UK since 2018, is studying at St Andrews University as part of a PHD scholarship programme. She currently has protection status as a refugee in the UK but plans to apply for indefinite leave to remain next year, which would make her status permanent if successful. She told BBC Scotland News that she came from “a normal family, living their lives, working and having a simple life in Gaza. “My brothers and sisters were studying at university or high school. They had a peaceful life even if it was interrupted by war. ”The attack on Israel by Hamas on 7 October has been followed by a year of conflict. Earlier this year Ms Louz raised £40,000 on the GoFundMe platform to pay for four members of her family to be evacuated from Gaza through the Rafah crossing to Egypt. Her parents are currently in the UAE, where her father is receiving humanitarian treatment for lymphoma cancer, provided by the state. He can remain there while receiving treatment, but may need to return to Egypt when this ends. Five of her siblings are currently living as undocumented immigrants in Egypt and her other two sisters are in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza because she did not have enough funds to secure their passage to Egypt. The Home Office application only applies to her four unmarried siblings in Egypt. Ms Louz said: “The only thing I was able to do was to try and find a way to bring them to safety, so that was my priority. They are all dependent on me, I am the only one that can help them. “Safety is to be surrounded by your family, it’s not to be safe from missiles and bombardments, that’s not the only meaning of safety. “Being deprived of the right of being surrounded by my family, safe and healthy, is really difficult. ”Earlier this year she applied to the Home Office for what is known as family reunification protection, in an effort to enable her parents and siblings to join her in the UK. This scheme applies to a partner or dependent child and - in most cases - siblings, the parents of adult children and extended family are not eligible. However, they may also be granted refugee status if they have ""exceptional circumstances"", according to the Home Office. Lawyer Andy Sirel, from human rights law firm JustRightScotland, said he thought the way the Home Office conducted themselves with the family was “unfair and at times unlawful”. He said: “They advised her (Ms Louz) that her family’s circumstances are not exceptional enough and that the suffering they have experienced in Gaza is not above the level of other Palestinians in Gaza. Not only is that not a lawful test, it’s inhumane. ”The Scottish Refugee Council is calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to that introduced after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 and the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme allows those who were evacuated to the UK to bring over parents and siblings in “exceptional circumstances”. The Ukrainian Family Scheme, which closed to new applicants earlier this year, also allowed eligible Ukrainian nationals to join family members in the UK for up to three years. Sabir Zazai, the chair of the Scottish Refugee Council, said the UK government had the opportunity to introduce a family scheme and expand the definition of family. “In many cultures family is much wider than just spouses and children,” he said. “I’m from Afghanistan. In my culture looking after my family, my father, my mother and sisters and brothers, is part of my values. “We believe that when people are forced to flee their homes, when their lives are shattered, it takes all parts of society to work together to help them rebuild their lives in safety and dignity. ""Refugee protection is not about politics, it's about common human decency. ”The Home Office said it had a long-standing policy of not commenting on individual cases.",Palestinian refugee to challenge family reunion bid rejection,Palestinian refugee to challenge family reunion bid rejection,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2lg92edj7o,articles/article_3218.txt,results/article_3218.txt.json

One man told the BBC that he saw streets strewn with bodies after being ordered to leave a shelter by Israeli forces, while a woman said some people left in such panic that they left their children behind. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees called for a temporary truce to enable safe passage for families still wishing to flee, while two local hospitals warned that they were running out of supplies. The Israeli military said its troops were continuing operations against Hamas fighters while enabling the secure evacuation of civilians. More than 400 people are reported to have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced since the military said it was launching a third offensive in the Jabalia area on 6 October, saying it was rooting out Hamas fighters who had regrouped there. It came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Israel to try to revive the stalled diplomatic process for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal in the wake of last week's killing by Israeli troops of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. After meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told reporters that he wanted ""to make sure that this is a moment of opportunity to move forward"". Mr Blinken also emphasized the need for Israel to take additional steps to increase and sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme interviewed several displaced people who had recently fled Jabalia camp and sought refuge in the nearby Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City. A man called Saleh said he had “endured a siege for 16 days” while sheltering with his family at Abu Hussein Primary School for Boys. Medics and rescue workers said more than 20 people were killed in an Israeli air strike there last week. The Israeli military named on Tuesday 18 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters who it said were among the dead. “The shelling grew closer and intensified each day, with Israeli forces advancing towards us. Today, we heard bombings very near. . . We feared for our lives,” Saleh said. “We received messages via [Israeli] quadcopters urging us to evacuate, so we began to move under the watch of Israeli soldiers, who demanded we go towards either the south or west of Gaza. . . I had my grandmother with me, she was unable to move, like many others. ”Another man, Mohammed al-Danani, said he was at the same school and that he had “witnessed the bodies of martyrs on the streets” after complying with the evacuation order. Engy Abdel Aal said she had been in the Abu Rashid Pond area when quadcopters broadcast orders directing people to move towards the town of Beit Lahia, just north of the camp. “The situation was incredibly difficult, no-one knew where to go. It’s tragic and catastrophic in every sense,” she said. “Some people had to flee without their children, leaving them behind in the school while they escaped with others. ”The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it troops were “continuing combat in the Jabalia area, while enabling the secure evacuation of civilians from the combat zone”. “As a result, thousands of civilians have been evacuated. Dozens of terrorists were arrested from among the civilians,” it said in a post on X that included a video showing crowds walking through damaged streets, external. The military also said that troops “eliminated 10 terrorists that posed a threat and operated adjacent to them” in a single strike, without giving any details. The Palestinian Red Crescent meanwhile posted a video that it said showed an ambulance transporting the bodies of five people, including children, killed by shelling in Jabalia town on Monday. Another graphic video filmed on the same day showed paramedic Nevin al-Dawasah trying to help dead and wounded men, women and children at a tented camp next to Jabalia Preparatory School for Boys. After fleeing the area on Tuesday, Ms Dawasah told AFP news agency that people had been complying with an evacuation order when “suddenly there was shelling”. “We had martyrs and wounded and there was no safe passage for the ambulances to come,” she said. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the reports. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said its staff in northern Gaza were reporting that they could not find food, water or medical care. “The smell of death is everywhere as bodies are left lying on the roads or under the rubble,"" he wrote on X. “People are just waiting to die. They feel deserted, hopeless and alone. ""Mr Lazzarini called for “an immediate truce, even if for few hours, to enable safe humanitarian passage for families who wish to leave the area and reach safer places”. A UN spokesman said Israeli authorities were continuing to deny requests from its Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to help rescue civilians trapped under the rubble and to deliver desperately needed supplies to hospitals. The director of the Indonesian hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals near Jabalia, told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme that Israeli troops were stationed outside its gates and that there was constant gunfire in the vicinity. “This has created an atmosphere of fear and confusion among patients and medical staff,” Dr Marwan al-Sultan said. “We are also facing a critical shortage of fuel, medical supplies, personnel, food, and water. ”“Additionally, ongoing power outages force the hospital to rely on alternative energy sources that last only eight to 10 hours. During the remaining time, the medical staff cannot operate the electric generators, which endangers patients who require oxygen. ”Dr Sultan also denied reports that there had been a fire at the hospital on Monday, saying there had been a blaze inside an adjacent school, near several generators. The Israeli military has said it is ensuring hospitals remain operational during the offensive. It has also said that more than 230 lorries carrying food, water, medical supplies and shelters have been transferred to northern Gaza via the Erez West crossing since last week, following a two-week period when the UN said there were no deliveries. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,710 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Palestinians fleeing Jabalia say bodies are left lying on streets,Palestinians fleeing Jabalia say bodies are left lying on streets,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7818g3n3lko,articles/article_3220.txt,results/article_3220.txt.json
3221,2024-11-07 15:03:06.948000+00:00,/news/articles/cvgl056yj2vo,"More than 200 seriously injured and ill Palestinians and their carers have been evacuated from Gaza, in one of the biggest operations of its kind in months, Israel says. The operation - overseen by Cogat, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, and the World Health Organization - saw 231 Gazans allowed through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing. They include people with autoimmune diseases, blood diseases, cancer, kidney conditions and trauma injuries. The WHO said there were still up to 14,000 people waiting for evacuation for medical reasons. Israel and Egypt closed their crossings with Gaza following Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October last year. Almost 4,900 Palestinian patients needing treatment abroad were allowed to leave between November, when Egypt reopened the Rafah crossing for medical evacuations, and May, when Egypt closed the crossing after Israeli forces seized control of the Gaza side. Setback for evacuated Gaza teen after surgeryBefore Wednesday’s evacuation, only 229 patients had left since May, according to the UN. Wednesday also saw the WHO and Cogat announce the conclusion of the polio vaccination campaign across Gaza. The WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said 556,770 children under the age of 10 - or 94% - had received two doses of the vaccine since September. The programme came about in reaction to the discovery of a case of polio in August, the first recorded in Gaza for 25 years. The virus can paralyse children or even kill them. It has been the subject of a global vaccination campaign for decades and has been mostly eradicated. On Saturday, the WHO and other UN agencies set out to administer vaccines in Gaza City, after being forced to postpone the rollout in the north of the territory last month because of Israeli bombardment, mass displacement and lack of access. The three-day operation was briefly interrupted by an attack on a hospital. The WHO did not say who was behind the strike, but local medical staff blamed an Israeli quadcopter. The Israeli military said it was investigating but did not believe it was responsible. Dr Tedros said 105,500 children in the north of Gaza received a second dose, which amounted to around 88% coverage. For herd immunity to work, at least 90% of all children in every community and neighbourhood need to be given a minimum of two doses. He warned that “7,000-10,000 children couldn't be reached for their second doses and are thus vulnerable to polio”. Parts of northern Gaza were not included in the vaccinations due to the continuation of intense Israeli military operations in towns like Jabalia and Beit Lahia. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Wednesday morning announced that troops had started to operate in Beit Lahia following what it said was intelligence “indicating the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure”. The IDF called on all remaining civilians to leave the area through what it called “organised routes for their safety”. Beit Lahia has come under heavy bombardment since the IDF launched a ground offensive in neighbouring Jabalia a month ago, saying it was acting against regrouping Hamas fighters. The IDF said its troops had killed 50 “terrorists” in Jabalia over the past day. The BBC and other international media are not able to get access to the Gaza Strip and so cannot independently verify these claims. The people transported out of Gaza in the medical evacuation operation will be taken to the United Arab Emirates or Romania for treatment. One of those being moved was Khuloud Tabasi's son Mohammed. Hugging her husband as she entered the ambulance in the southern city of Khan Younis, Khuloud said after four operations her son’s “situation went from bad to worse. . . Thank God [the WHO] organised the evacuation of my son. ""Israel has been under growing international pressure to do something to improve the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Last weekend, 15 senior UN figures said conditions in the north were “apocalyptic”, with the entire population “at risk of death from starvation, disease and violence”. Israel has also faced calls from its ally, the US, to take action. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the Israeli government on 13 October that it had 30 days to “surge” humanitarian aid to Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off. The numbers still in need of medical support are huge, with 19 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals out of service and the other 17 only partially functional. Dr Marwan Abu Saada is general manager of the al-Shifa medical complex in Gaza City, which was left in ruins after being raided by Israeli forces for a second time in March. The IDF said it had been used by Hamas for military purposes, something the group has always denied. Parts of al-Shifa have now been rebuilt and reopened, including the emergency department, and the hospital recently received patients evacuated from hospitals in Beit Lahia. Dr Abu Saada said there were children with leukaemia, people with breast and other cancers, as well as those disabled by the fighting. “They desperately need to travel abroad as soon as possible,” he said. ""Since none of the treatment facilities are available in Gaza. ”While Wednesday’s evacuation has been widely welcomed, the numbers taken to the UAE and Romania are a small fraction of the total who need medical aid.

Dozens of people attended the service, which was held in Bonn Square on Sunday night. It happened on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, which saw gunmen storm into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. The event saw residents gather, along with faith and community leaders. It was organised by the Oxfordshire Civic, Community and Faith Leaders’ Group, and  led by the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft and imam Monawar Hussain. Representatives from all faiths were invited to pray and reflect on conflicts around the world, with a focus on those living in Gaza and Israel.

Jayson Gillham premiered Witness at a show at the MSO on Sunday. The piece was penned by another composer as a tribute to the Palestinian press. The British-Australian was scheduled to perform again on Thursday, but the MSO has said it is reworking the programme after Gillham introduced the piece by saying  Israel had killed more than 100 journalists. A spokesperson for Gillham told the ABC he won't comment on the decision to drop him ""out of respect to the MSO and his ongoing relationship with them"". Gillham - who is billed on the MSO website as ""as one of the finest pianists of his generation"" - was born in Australia but lives in the UK. At the concert at the Iwaki Auditorium on Sunday, he performed a range of works, from Beethoven to Chopin. He also played Witness, written by Australian composer Connor D'Netto, which the MSO says was a last-minute addition. ""Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists,"" Mr Gillham said before starting the piece. A number were ""targeted assassinations of prominent journalists"" who were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing press jackets, he claimed. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" he added. In an email to patrons, the MSO said they were blindsided by Mr Gillham's comments and he had put them in a ""difficult situation"". “The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views”, it added. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom, reports that 113 of those were journalists. Apologising for the ""offence and distress"" caused, the MSO said it had removed Gillham from the program and would update customers soon. In a statement given to local media, a spokesperson for the MSO said: ""Mr Gillham's remarks went beyond the remit of his contract. ""The decision has caused a backlash on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling” while arts critics and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said “MSO management should hang its collective head in shame”.

Saying Israel was committing a ""genocide"", Mr Zomlot added: ""It is heart-breaking that death in Gaza has become the best of options, the easiest of options. ""About 1,200 people - mostly Israeli civilians - were killed in the Hamas 7 October attacks just over one year ago. Since then, some 42,000 people have been killed as part of Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The motion proposed by the party's members in Ceredigion and backed by Plaid's MPs condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the ""murders of tens of thousands of Palestinians, including over 10,000 children, by the state of Israel"". It criticised the ""violence perpetrated by Hamas against innocent people in Israel"" but says the ""increasingly oppressive apartheid regime maintained by the Israeli government makes a two-state solution less likely to bring about a just peace"". The motion said the UK government should ""expel the Israeli ambassador"", ban arms sales to Israel, and that all Plaid members should support an ""economic and cultural boycott"". That would include Welsh national sports teams boycotting the country. It also said councils should divest from companies that ""support the apartheid Israeli state"". Ben Lake, MP for Ceredigion Preseli who proposed the motion at conference, said: “We should offer no assistance to states that are in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions and ICJ rulings. ""We urgently need a political settlement to this war – that should include official recognition of Palestinian statehood. ”The Plaid motion cited Amnesty International, which in 2022 said Israel's laws, policies and practices against Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories amounted to apartheid. It said it maintained ""an institutionalised regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis"". At the time, Israel's foreign ministry had accused Amnesty of recycling ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organisations"". Palestinians have accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, which the country has denied. The UN human rights special rapporteur Francesa Albanese has said she believes Israel has committed ""acts of genocide"", while the International Court of Justice ruled in January that the country should ""take all measures to prevent genocidal acts"". In an interview with the BBC, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth hinted at a difference of opinion on the matter, declining to confirm whether he personally endorsed the motion. Ap Iorwerth said Israel had acted contrary to international law. ""Individuals will take different positions on matters like boycotts,"" he said. ""Those attacks a year ago were appalling, and we condemn them. We need to see the release of surviving hostages, but we also need to call out the state of Israel.

The Iran-backed militia, which is based in Lebanon, said it would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has attacked areas it says are Hezbollah strongholds in different parts of Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut. On Saturday, an Israeli strike in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, with Israel saying 20 more of the group's senior members were killed in the attack. Ms Ghalayini moved to Beirut from north London when she married in August last year. She said she had no idea when she would see her husband again, or if she will be able to return to Lebanon before her baby is born. Ms Ghalayini said the only commercial airline she could find leaving Beirut was Middle East Airlines - and she was only able to get a seat because her husband is a pilot for the company. ""I feel terrible and guilty that I have been able to leave,"" she said. ""I didn’t want to leave my husband. My heart is with him. ""She said Beirut Airport, where she departed from, was ""chaotic"" and ""rammed with people"", adding that the plane did not have an empty seat. ""[The flight] was obviously emotional - everyone had a story. ""Everyone on the plane felt at ease as soon as the airplane left Lebanese airspace.

Lea said: “It was all unexpected. Just got the tickets, two days later we’re at the airport.

The group scaled a roof, unfurled banners and set off pyrotechnics at the Thales UK building in Govan  on 1 June 2022. Two of them entered the building itself and a smoke bomb was thrown into an area where staff were being evacuated, Glasgow Sheriff Court was told. Stuart Bretherton, 25, Eva Simmons, 25, Calum Lacy, 23, Erica Hygate, 23 received 12-month sentences, while Sumaya Javaid, 22, was jailed for 14 months.  There were shouts of ""free Palestine"" and ""you are preventing genocide"" by supporters in the public gallery as the five were led into custody. The French firm Thales manufactures a wide range of military equipment including drone components. It has often been targeted by activists because it has partnerships with Israeli companies, although it denies it supplies the Israeli military. Sheriff John McCormick said the group had been spotted at the site early in the morning, dressed in red overalls, as they scaled the security fence. They made it onto the roof of the main building where they unfurled banners and flags, as more protesters gathered outside. ""Miss Hygate and Miss Javaid entered the building through the roof and caused damage including to parts essential to submarines,"" the sheriff said. ""Fire alarms were activated which caused an evacuation and confusion as well as panic among staff. ""You set off pyrotechnics and smoke bombs - some thrown in the area where staff where evacuated. The smoke was dangerously close to the members of staff. "" Some protesters remained on the roof overnight and glued their hands to the building to prevent police removing them. The damage was estimated at £1,130,783 and the site was shut due to safety concerns. The sheriff said the figure did not include the cost the public purse of the police operation which involved more than 20 officers.

The march organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and saw demonstrators walk from Park Lane to near Parliament. It comes amid heavy police presence - with a counter protest by the pro-Israel Stop the Hate group taking place on the route - and on one of the busiest shopping days in the capital in the lead up to Christmas. The Metropolitan Police issued a reminder to the marchers that expressing support for militant groups Hamas or Hezbollah is a criminal offence - with both being proscribed terror organisations in the UK. Officers said chanting slogans, wearing clothing and displaying articles including flags, signs or logos that express support for the groups would amount to an offence. Speeches took place outside Parliament in Whitehall, with demonstrators told  finish by 16:30 GMT. The Stop the Hate supporters gathered on the march's route, on Coventry Street, near Piccadilly Circus. The two groups were separated by metal barriers and a row of police. Jon Savell, Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, who is in charge of Saturday's police operation, said the Met worked with organisers to ""minimise disruption"" and ""balance the right to protest"". He said: ""Ahead of the weekend we have been in regular discussions with the PSC, counter-protesters Stop the Hate, as well as faith and community groups - particularly the Jewish community who we know continue to be impacted by protests - residents, and businesses. ""The officer added there were also ""many people shopping during the Black Friday sales, and visiting the capital ahead of the festive period, including Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park which is nearby"". Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The London march was the 22nd since the conflict began, according to the PSC. It also comes in the week a ceasefire deal was reached to end 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and Hamas's military chief, Mohammed Deif, who were all accused of crimes against humanity for their roles in the Gaza war.

3231,2024-11-05 18:16:56.400000+00:00,/news/articles/cqj07jdzzgno,"Protests have erupted in Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the country's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu said a ""crisis of trust"" between the two leaders led to his decision, adding that his trust in Gallant had ""eroded"" in recent months and Foreign Minister Israel Katz would step in to replace him. Gallant said his removal was due to disagreement on three issues, including his belief that it is possible to get the remaining hostages back from Gaza if Israel makes ""painful concessions"" which it ""can bear"". Many protesters on the streets were calling for Netanyahu to resign, and demanding the new defence minister prioritise a hostage deal. Netanyahu and Gallant have long had a divisive working relationship. During the past year, there have been reports of shouting matches between the two men over Israel’s war strategy. The former defence minister has also been unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel’s Ultra Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military. Months before the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Netanyahu had fired Gallant over political differences, before reinstating him following major public outcry. But on Tuesday Netanyahu said: ""In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defence"". He said although there had been trust and ""fruitful work"" in the first months of the war, ""during the last months this trust cracked"". Netanyahu added that ""significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign"". These were ""accompanied by statements and actions that contradict the decisions of the government,"" he added. Following the news, Gallant posted on social media that the ""security of the state of Israel was and will always remain the mission of my life"". He later released a full statement on Tuesday night saying his removal from office had been ""the result of disagreement on three issues"". He believed there should be no exceptions for military service,  that a national inquiry was needed to learn lessons, and the hostages should be brought back as soon as possible. In reference to the hostages, he said: ""I determine that it is possible to achieve this goal. It requires painful concessions, which the state of Israel can carry and the IDF can bear. ""One of those protesting following the announcement, Yair Amit, said Netanyahu is endangering the whole country and called on the prime minister to ""step down from his office and to let serious people lead Israel"". Some protesters lit fires on the Ayalon Highway and blocked traffic in both directions, according to Israeli media. A group representing the families of people taken hostage by Hamas in its 7 October attack also condemned Netanyahu's dismissal of Gallant, calling it a continuation of efforts to ""torpedo"" a release deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum called on the incoming defence minister to “express an explicit commitment to the end of the war and to carry out a comprehensive deal for the immediate return of all the abductees”. Around 100 hostages out of 251 taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 remain unaccounted for more than a year into the war. His replacement Katz is seen as even more hawkish in terms of military strategy. Another Netanyahu ally, Gideon Sa'ar - who previously held no cabinet portfolio- will become the new foreign minister. Gallant's removal will come into effect in 48 hours. The appointment of the new ministers requires the approval of the government and then the Knesset. Netanyahu first fired Gallant in March 2023 following their disagreement over controversial plans to overhaul the justice system. But he was forced to retract the sacking following massive public protests in several cities in Israel - an event that became known as ""Gallant Night. ""In May this year, Gallant voiced open frustration at the government’s failure to address the question of a post-war plan for Gaza. Gallant wanted Netanyahu to declare publicly that Israel has no plans to take over civilian and military rule in Gaza. It was a rare public sign of divisions within Israel's war cabinet over the direction of the military campaign. “Since October, I have been raising this issue consistently in the cabinet,” Gallant said, “and have received no response"". Netanyahu responded by saying that he was ""not ready to exchange Hamastan for Fatahstan,"" in reference to rival Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah. Responding to Gallant's removal on Tuesday night, members of Israel's political opposition parties called for protests from the public. Gallant’s dismissal also takes place on the day of the presidential election in the US- Israel’s key backer in its war in Gaza - a timing noted by several Israeli media outlets. Gallant was viewed as having a much better relationship with the White House than Netanyahu. A representative for the White House's National Security Council said on Tuesday: ""Minister Gallant has been an important partner on all matters related to the defence of Israel. As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defence. ""Observers note that Gallant's removal also comes at a time where Netanyahu is under pressure by far-right politicians to pass a bill which would have continued to allow Israel's ultra-Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military. Gallant had been a high-profile opponent of the bill.",Protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires defence minister,Protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires defence minister,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqj07jdzzgno,articles/article_3231.txt,results/article_3231.txt.json
3233,2024-11-09 11:07:02.021000+00:00,/news/articles/c774d4p2mx6o,"Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say. The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel ""show their willingness"" to negotiate. It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza. Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha ""no longer serves its purpose"" were ""inaccurate"".  ""Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,"" a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said. ""Qatar will resume those efforts. . . when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war. ""Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration. Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to ""a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith"". But the foreign ministry said the reports were ""inaccurate"". The claims have also been denied by Hamas officials. The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia. Alongside the US and Egypt, the Qataris have also played a major role in rounds of so-far unsuccessful talks to broker a ceasefire in the year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But there is growing evidence of a shift in the relationship. After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas held a two-hour mourning tent in Doha in a small hall, a stark contrast to the recent three-day mourning held for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was conducted with official state oversight and security. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. The group has always called for a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The Qatari foreign ministry statement said: ""Media reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha is inaccurate. """"The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication. . . [which] has contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages. ""Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals. Days after being fired earlier this week, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rejecting a peace deal against the advice of his security chiefs. The call for Hamas to be expelled from Qatar appears to be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to force some sort of peace deal before the end of his term in January. Were Hamas to be forced to leave Doha, it is unclear where they would base their political office. Key ally Iran would be an option, although the assassination of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July suggests they may be at risk from Israel if based there. It would also not give them anything close to the same diplomatic channels to the West. A more likely option would be Turkey. As a Nato member but also a Sunni majority state, it would give the group a base from which to operate in relative safety. Last April President Erdogan hosted then Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and his delegation in Istanbul, where they talked about “what needs to be done to ensure adequate and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and a fair and lasting peace process in the region"". The move would also most likely be welcomed by Ankara, which has often sought to position itself as a broker between east and west. Key Hamas figures such as Osama Hamdan, Taher al-Nunu, and others frequently featured on news outlets have been staying in Istanbul for over a month. Their extended presence in Turkey marks a departure from past visits, which were typically limited to brief stays. It is thought the personal safety of Hamas leadership is now a major concern for the group, which saw two leaders killed in less than four months. As well as Haniyeh’s death in July, in October Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel. According to the European Council of Foreign Relations, “Hamas has adopted a temporary model of collective leadership to mitigate the effect of future Israeli assassinations”. H A Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC that nowhere “will give them protection from Israeli assassination attempts in the same way that being in Doha, where America has its largest military base in the region, did”. The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war. In October, the US Secretaries of State and Defense said if Israel did not allow more humanitarian aid into the territory by 12 November, they would face unspecified policy “implications”. Last weekend a number of UN officials warned the situation in northern Gaza was “apocalyptic”. On Saturday the independent Famine Review Committee said there was a “strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas”. The relationship between President Joe Biden and Netanyahu has deteriorated over the course of the war in Gaza, with increasing pressure from Washington to improve the humanitarian situation for the Palestinians and find some sort of negotiated settlement. But, according to Dr Hellyer, US attempts at negotiation have been fatally flawed. “By setting red lines and allowing Netanyahu to cross them without consequence, the Biden administration effectively encouraged further impunity. I don’t think any of this will change in the next 10 weeks,” he said. Any overtures have been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition, who will now also feel emboldened by the prospect of an incoming Donald Trump presidency. While exactly what approach Trump will take to the region remains uncertain, he is thought to be more likely to allow Israel to act on its terms. He has previously said Israel should “finish what they started” in Gaza. During his last term in the White House, he took a number of steps deemed highly favourable to Israel, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. It has also been reported, however, that Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants to see an end to the fighting by the time he takes office. Either way, it seems likely that the current US administration will have less influence over the government in Jerusalem. They may therefore believe the best way to force some sort of deal is to apply pressure on Hamas.  Whether it pays off may depend on whether Qatar, so long a reliable ally, decides to go along with it.",Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas,Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas,"israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c774d4p2mx6o,articles/article_3233.txt,results/article_3233.txt.json

People, who moved on foot, carried bags with their belongings, unsure about where they were going but certain that they could not stay. This was the scene on Tuesday in Nuweiri, central Beirut, moments after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings, the first for these areas. We were trying to visit the site of an Israeli air strike hours earlier, in the afternoon, that came without warning, flattened one building and killed at least seven people. But we could not get there. Crowds were leaving, and men on motorbikes stopped us from moving, saying it was not safe. Minutes later, we heard several explosions, from more attacks. And for hours, that was how the night unfolded in Beirut. Multiple blasts. Some in the distance; others closer. Gunshots announced more warnings, urging people to seek safety. All of this, with the constant sound of an Israeli drone flying overhead. This dramatic escalation came as the country waited for an Israeli decision on a ceasefire deal, the main hope to end over a year of conflict with Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement. During that wait, Israel unleashed its most intense bombardment of Beirut in the conflict. Within two minutes, shortly after the attack on Nuweiri, fighter jets hit 20 targets in the city’s southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets hit were facilities used by Hezbollah, and the wave of attacks was heard across the city. Follow live updates from Israel and Lebanon What we know about the ceasefire dealIsraeli anger at 'irresponsible and hasty' ceasefireWatch: People in Israel and Lebanon react Now, a ceasefire has been officially announced, but questions remain. The war has been devastating for Lebanon, where more than 3,700 people have been killed since the start of the hostilities in October 2023, and one million residents have been displaced in areas where Hezbollah has strong presence. The World Bank estimates $8.5bn (£6.8bn) in economic losses and damage. Recovery will take time, and no-one seems to know who will pay for it. Under the deal, thousands of Lebanese soldiers will be deployed to the south, after the withdrawal of Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters. How they will be deployed remains unclear. The military has complained that they do not have the resources – money, manpower and equipment – to fulfil their obligations. But it is not only about funding, which will probably come from some of Lebanon’s international allies. Will the Lebanese military confront Hezbollah if needed? That would put Lebanese against Lebanese, which is always a risk in a country where sectarian divisions run deep. Lebanese authorities seem to have accepted that things must change, a diplomat told me. It appears there is political will to do so. Hezbollah, too, has been devastated. Many of its leaders have been killed, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, while its infrastructure has been heavily damaged. How it will look like after the war is another unknown. The group has been severely weakened, some would say humiliated, but it has not been destroyed. In Lebanon, it is more than a militia: it is a political party with representation in Parliament, and a social organisation, with significant support among Shia Muslims. Its opponents will probably see it as an opportunity to limit its influence. Before the conflict, Hezbollah was often described as a state within a state in Lebanon. And for months, people outside Hezbollah’s support base said the group had dragged the country into a war that was not in its interests. This deal may bring the conflict with Israel to an end. But many in Lebanon fear a new internal conflict could follow.",Questions over Hezbollah's future after ceasefire,Questions over Hezbollah's future after ceasefire,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce89r02w1z1o,articles/article_3234.txt,results/article_3234.txt.json
3235,2024-11-23 21:39:14.475000+00:00,/news/articles/cwy4j5j7503o,"Israel says a rabbi who went missing in the United Arab Emirates has been murdered, and have vowed to track down his killers. “The murder of Zvi Kogan is a criminal antisemitic terrorist incident. The State of Israel will act in all of its abilities to bring to justice the criminals responsible for his death,” the PM’s office said following news on Sunday that the rabbi's body had been found. Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder, the UAE's interior ministry confirmed on Sunday evening. Rabbi Kogan, an envoy of the orthodox Jewish organisation Chabad Lubavitch, had been missing in Dubai since Thursday sparking a investigation from Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and UAE authorities. Israeli officials have been in contact with the family of the Israeli-Moldovan national, since he went missing, the Israeli statement continued. The recovery of Zvi Kogan's body comes after his abandoned car was found an hour's drive away from his home. Israel’s President Isaac Herzog also called his murder ""a vile, antisemitic attack"". Mossad investigators are working to identify those responsible for the rabbi's death. Chabad is a religious foundation that seeks to build links with non-affiliated and secular Jews or other sects of Judaism. The group's branch in the UAE supports thousands of Jewish visitors and residents, according to its website, external. Rabbi Kogan, 28, worked with other Chabad emissaries ""in establishing and expanding Jewish life in the Emirates"", the organisation says, external. He also managed a kosher supermarket in Dubai. Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, chairman of Chabad Lubavitch said: ""We trust that the UAE will work with the countries in the region to bring the perpetrators to justice, and hold all those involved accountable for this act of sheer evil. ""The Israeli government's travel advisory service warns citizens to only travel to the UAE for ""essential reasons"", as they say there is ""terrorist activity"" in the UAE, which constitutes ""a real risk to Israelis who are staying/visiting in the country"". Abu Dhabi established formal ties with Israel under an agreement brokered by the US, known as the Abraham Accords. It has maintained the relationship during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

3236,2024-10-31 06:23:22.641000+00:00,/news/articles/c5yrv2zyd22o,"Radiohead singer Thom Yorke briefly walked off stage during his Australian solo tour after an exchange with an audience member who heckled him with a protest about deaths in Gaza. Videos posted online by concert-goers at the Melbourne show on Wednesday show a man in the crowd shouting at Yorke. While not all of his words can be heard, he calls on the singer to ""condemn the Israeli genocide of Gaza"". Yorke responds by telling the heckler to ""hop up on stage"" to make his remarks. ""Don't stand there like a coward, come here and say it. You want to piss on everybody's night? Ok you do it, see you later,"" Yorke continues, before removing his guitar and halting his set. His exit came as the heckler had repeated his call and added ""how many dead children will it take"". Segments of the crowd could be heard booing the disturbance, and Yorke returned to cheers shortly after to play the Radiohead song Karma Police.  Concert-goer Elly Brus said the protester ""did not have support"" from the Sidney Myer Music Bowl crowd. “He was escorted away by security. He then continued to engage with people outside the venue as well,"" she told the BBC. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. More than 43,160 people have been killed in Gaza since then - including thousands of women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Both sides deny accusations they have broken the laws of war. In the past, Radiohead has faced pressure to cancel shows in Israel and take part in a cultural boycott of the country over its policies towards the Palestinians. Yorke pushed back on that pressure, saying that ""playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government"". ""We've played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others,"" Yorke said in a statement in 2017, defending a decision to go ahead with a planned concert in Tel Aviv. ""We don't endorse [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them,"" he added at the time. Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian activists also accused Yorke's bandmate Jonny Greenwood of ""artwashing"" for performing alongside Israeli-Arabic musician Dudu Tassa in Tel Aviv. ""No art is as 'important' as stopping all the death and suffering around us,"" Greenwood said in a statement on X. ""But. . . silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn't seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict.

3237,2024-07-30 14:25:40.112000+00:00,/news/articles/cj506dzqmqlo,"Injured and critically ill Palestinians are on their way from Gaza to the United Arab Emirates for treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, in the largest single medical evacuation since the war began following the brutal Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October. Later on Tuesday the WHO said 85 sick and severely injured patients from Gaza had been evacuated to Abu Dhabi. The sweeping Israeli military operations that followed have wrecked Gaza’s healthcare system. And the main route for medical evacuees through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut down after the Israeli military took control there in early May. The WHO says so far some 5,000 Gazans have received treatment outside of the territory, but another 10,000 still need to leave. This latest group began to gather on Sunday at pickup points for transport to a central location before departing. In the central city of Deir al-Balah the bus station was crowded with patients and their families. “I call on the whole world to look at us with compassion,” said Shaza Abu Selim, who was pushing her daughter, Lamis, in a wheelchair. The young girl needs major surgery for scoliosis, which has been delayed now by six months. She barely moved, her face stained with tears and exhaustion. “I could not believe it when they contacted me [to say] that my daughter was among those on the list going outside Gaza for treatment,” said her mother. “I do not know when the war will end… and may God make it easy and heal everyone. ” Even before the conflict some Gazans got care outside the territory because the health system wasn’t equipped to deal with complex medical conditions. But Israeli bombardments have closed hospitals, killed doctors, blocked medicines, and overwhelmed remaining facilities with casualties. Nasima al-Ajeel’s story encapsulates the misery and desperation this has caused. “We were struck” she says. “My eldest son was killed, my father was killed, my youngest son, Asser, lost his sight. ”Ms al-Ajeel is sitting and holding little Asser, his eyelid closed over an empty socket. Her leg is wrapped in bandages. “His left eye was blown out with a skull fracture,” she said. “My middle son suffers from a leg injury and leg deformities, and I suffer a skull fracture, blindness in my left eye, and a broken shoulder and ribs. ""The Israeli army says it has discovered Hamas combatants and infrastructure inside hospitals and health clinics, something the militant Islamist movement, which controlled Gaza before the war, denies. But human rights activists have accused Israel of obstructing medical evacuations. Physicians for Human Rights in Israel and other groups filed a petition in Israel’s High Court of Justice in early June after the Rafah crossing was closed. Since Israeli forces captured the border area at the start of their ground operation there two months ago, Egypt has refused to reopen the crossing, the only route out of Gaza that does not lead into Israel and previously a main exit point for fleeing civilians and a major channel for aid. Egyptian officials have insisted that the Gazan side of the crossing must be returned to Palestinian control. As a result of the court action, the Israeli government committed to establishing a permanent mechanism for allowing regular medical evacuations. But it has yet to do so, and on Sunday it announced it was cancelling the expected evacuation without saying why. The Kan public broadcaster reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had made the decision himself, following a deadly Hezbollah attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights at the weekend which killed 12 children and teenagers. That seems to have been quickly reversed. Azza Ahmed Kafarneh, a 57-year-old mother and grandmother suffering from cancer, told the BBC that the patients had prepared to go back home on hearing the news, but were told to stay because “there is a big potential that they will agree for you to leave”. In the end the Israelis agreed to transfer the patients through Israel via Gaza's Kerem Shalom crossing and they flew out from an airport near the town of Eilat. ""We hope this paves the way for the establishment of evacuation corridors via all possible routes, including the Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings to Egypt and Jordan, and from there to other countries,” the WHO said in a statement. “We also call for (medical) evacuations to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored. ”Nothing is certain in this war, and for those fortunate enough to escape it, the goodbyes are bittersweet. Sarah Marzouk, a 12-year-old girl who says she lost her foot when her neighbour’s house was bombed, was wiping away tears at the bus station on Sunday. “I wish that the war would end and that all children like me would be able to come with me and have artificial limbs fitted and receive treatment abroad,” she said. “I also hope that I will return to see my father in peace. ”Ms Ahmed Kafarneh said she wouldn’t leave if she didn’t feel so sick. She hasn’t heard of any medical evacuees who’ve returned to Gaza. “I am confused between leaving my family and going out to get treated,” she said. “And things maybe will take a longer time and the war maybe will take a long time and things might get worse. Nobody knows. ”",Relief as Palestinian medical evacuees leave Gaza,Relief as Palestinian medical evacuees leave Gaza,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj506dzqmqlo,articles/article_3237.txt,results/article_3237.txt.json
3239,2024-11-16 00:45:39.862000+00:00,/news/articles/ce89051rypdo,"Since the start of the Israel-Hezbollah war, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have fled their homes because of the fighting. But the residents of one town right in the combat zone have decided to stay. Rmeish, just 2km (1.2 miles) from the border, is home to 7,000 Maronite Christians - and surrounded by firing on all sides. “There’s lots of damage. Maybe 90% of houses have damage of some kind, glass smashed and cracks in the walls. I don’t know what’s going to happen when winter comes,” says Jiries al-Alam, a farmer who also works as an undertaker with the town’s church. “We are determined to stay but hardly anyone sleeps at night because of the air strikes. Thankfully, there’s been no deaths among the residents so far, but 200 of my cattle died from the military flares,” he adds. A day after Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, its Lebanese ally Hezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel, which in turn, started to strike Lebanon. The residents of Rmeish began seeing rockets flying in both directions above them. “Lots of families raised white flags on their homes and cars to say that they are peaceful and have no link to what is happening,” says Father George al-Ameel, 44, a priest and teacher in the town. “We want to stay in our homes and don’t want any war in our town. ” After Israel began its ground invasion of Lebanon on 1 October this year, the war drew closer to Rmeish, with heavy fighting taking place in two villages both less than 1.6km away. “We were staying in our house for months, then the air strikes started getting very close and suddenly our house was hit, we were forced to leave in the middle of the night,” says Rasha Makhbour, 38. “People’s work has stopped and no-one goes out, our children’s school is shut, everything has changed. ”Rasha’s family of six moved to another house in the centre of town after theirs became uninhabitable. “We believe the rockets that hit our home came from the south, not from our country,” she says. The Israel Defense Forces told the BBC that there were “no known IDF strikes” on Rmeish during the dates Rasha Makhbour’s house was damaged, claiming it was a “failed launch by Hezbollah”. Israel has issued a general evacuation order for the south of Lebanon since its ground invasion began. The UN says over 640,000 people have been displaced from there as they flee the fighting. The Israeli government says that its military goals in southern Lebanon are to push back Hezbollah and return 60,000 Israelis displaced from its northern border towns to their homes. On the border with Israel, Rmeish is the only Lebanese town that has not been directly ordered to leave. While neither side has directly threatened the residents of Rmeish during the conflict, they have had their loyalty to Lebanon questioned. “There’s been voices under the table spreading rumours that our presence here is evidence of our collaboration with Israel, the enemy. We completely reject this,” says Father al-Ameel. It is a message reiterated by Rmeish’s mayor, Milad al-Alam. “We’ve had no guarantees of safety from any side,” he says. “Our town is peaceful, and our only cause is to stay for our identity and our country. ” Until the start of Israel’s ground invasion, a Lebanese army unit had stayed in Rmeish and helped organise movement in and out of the town. But as Israeli forces moved to cross the border, the Lebanese army – which is not directly involved in the war – decided to pull out of Rmeish, much to the distress of locals. The Lebanese army said it rejected the description that they have ‘withdrawn’ from border locations, referring the BBC to a statement that the army is “repositioning” a number of military units in the south. Then at the end of October, the main route out of Rmeish itself was hit – leaving residents feeling further isolated and vulnerable. Since then, just one aid convoy has reached the town with the coordination of UN peacekeeping forces, the Unifil mission said. “We have needs for fuel, foods and medicines, there was a delivery coming from Tyre that had to turn around,” says Father al-Ameel. “If someone is hurt, there’s no hospital for serious medical care. ”Mayor Al-Alam tells us he is optimistic that the route out of town will be regularly usable again soon, so they can fill up their fuel reserves, even if the route through an active warzone is dangerous. Others in the town remain anxious. “The situation is really bad. There are no goods, no food or fuel coming through. We’re starting to see items going missing from the shelves,” says Jiries al-Alam, the town undertaker. “But we’ll find a way through. Now is the olive season and in the worst case we can just eat olives. We want to stay in our homes and so we will die in our homes if we have to. ”Additional reporting by Joanna Majzoub and Aakriti Thapar",Residents of Lebanese border town 'determined to stay' as rockets fly above,Residents of Lebanese border town 'determined to stay' as rockets fly above,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce89051rypdo,articles/article_3239.txt,results/article_3239.txt.json
3240,2024-08-15 16:13:23.617000+00:00,/news/articles/c20rxr3pr50o,"If the leaks to local papers are true, even Israel’s defence chiefs are urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a deal and agree a ceasefire in Gaza. Since Israel’s negotiators last made the trip to the Qatari capital for talks, the stakes - and the pressures - have only grown. In Israel, the relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are calling this the “last chance” to get some of them out alive. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry - whose figures have been used by the UN and Israel in the past - says the number of people killed in Israeli operations there since the war began has now passed 40,000. And the US is moving a second aircraft carrier and a missile-equipped submarine to the region, after threats from Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, to attack Israel in response to the assassinations of key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last month. There is no lack of incentives for a deal. And no lack of pressure either. The US believes a truce in Gaza could help calm the entire region. Visiting Lebanon on Wednesday, US envoy Amos Hochstein said a deal would also help create the conditions for a deal in a growing cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. “We have to take advantage of this window for diplomatic action and diplomatic solutions,” he said. “That time is now. ”His boss, President Joe Biden, appears to be managing expectations. “It’s getting harder,” he told reporters in New Orleans this week, adding, “I’m not giving up. ”With so much to gain, why are hopes for these talks so thin?First, the red herring: the declaration by Hamas that it would not send a delegation to the meeting is unlikely to have a major impact. Negotiations have always been indirect, shuttle diplomacy - Hamas representatives do not talk directly to Israel or the US. And the group’s main international base is Doha, where talks are taking place, and where Qatari and Egyptian negotiators have an open channel of communication with them. The real issue, according to former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin, is a lack of motivation by the Israeli and Hamas leaders. “The United States, Egypt and Qatar have decided that they need to change the rules of the game: put an ultimatum on the table, put a bridging proposal on the table, and tell Hamas and Israel that they have to do it,” he said. “[But] it's obviously that the mediators want the agreement more than the parties do, and that's a big part of the problem. ”Chen Avigdori’s wife and 12-year-old daughter were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas in the 7 October attacks on Israel, when another 1,200 people were killed. The pair were released in November and he’s now campaigning to get the remaining 111 hostages out. “I think they are both holding it up,” he said. “I think Sinwar doesn't really care about his own people. But I think that Mr Netanyahu has skipped some opportunities that Israel already had to sign the deal. ” For Yahya Sinwar - one of the masterminds of the 7 October attacks, who became Hamas’s political leader following Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination in Tehran - some analysts believe the calculation may be changing. “I think Sinwar wants to save himself and save Hamas, because they haven't been destroyed totally, but militarily they've been defeated and it could turn into a rout,” said Chuck Freilich of Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “Netanyahu is in a more difficult position, because if there's a deal, there's a very good chance that he'll lose his coalition. ”Benjamin Netanyahu has so far held fast to certain red lines - including giving Israel the right to restart the war if later talks on troop withdrawal and prisoner exchanges fail. Mr Netanyahu’s far-right allies have vowed to pull out of the government if, for example, he agrees to release large numbers of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, in return for the hostages. The sticking points facing negotiators are substantial. But proposals to bridge some of them have been widely reported in the Israeli media. For instance, Mr Netanyahu’s insistence that Israeli forces must remain on Gaza’s border with Egypt, to stop armed groups smuggling in weapons, has been countered with solutions involving technology and the involvement of allies on the ground. Hamas has accused Israel of bringing in new demands and said that the time for negotiation is over.  It has said it is ready to implement the terms it agreed to last month. Israel denies it is adding new conditions, describing them as an attempt to clarify what was already agreed. The deal’s international mediators – the US, Qatar and Egypt – certainly have some leverage over the two sides, but it may not be enough to force an agreement if the parties themselves don’t want one. “The US and Qatar can push, they can cajole, they can offer inducements, they can offer to help create the technical solutions,” says Chuck Freilich. “But in the end, it's up to the specific leaders. ”Ultimately, the fate of these talks, of Gaza, of the hostages – even the fate of the region itself – will rest on the calculations of two shrewd survivors; two warring men.",Risk of regional war hangs over Gaza ceasefire talks,Risk of regional war hangs over Gaza ceasefire talks,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20rxr3pr50o,articles/article_3240.txt,results/article_3240.txt.json

The external affairs secretary has faced a backlash, including from some SNP colleagues who are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Mr Robertson said First Minister John Swinney was aware of the meeting taking place but the pair had not discussed it in person. The Scottish government has since suspended meetings with Israel until progress is made in peace talks. Mr Robertson has said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He met Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky, on 8 August after accepting an invitation from the Israeli government. Four days later, Ms Grudsky posted a photo, external of the pair on social media. She said they had discussed the release of Israeli hostages and that Israel was “looking forward to co-operating” with Scotland in areas including culture and renewables. That sparked criticism from SNP figures - including former ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - about the decision to take the meeting. Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Robertson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: “No, I haven't, because I think it was right to communicate the message that we did. “But I have reflected very strongly on the impact that it has created and the impression that was created, which is why I issued the apology yesterday. “I most certainly did not want to create an impression that there was a normalisation of relations between the Scottish government and the Israeli government when there is not. ” The external affairs secretary said issues which did not relate to the war were raised by Ms Grudsky, including energy, tourism and economic co-operation. ""That meeting was not an appropriate space or time for that meeting to take place,"" he said. Asked if he spoke to the first minister about the meeting before attending, Mr Robertson replied: “I don't think I spoke about it in person with him, but it was part of the government's internal deliberations, which included an official recommendation to meet that he was aware of. ""But it was me who ultimately made the decision that the meeting should go ahead. “Why? Because it would be the first opportunity to lay out the Scottish government and indeed the Scottish Parliament's strong opposition to what is and has been happening in Gaza. ""He also Israeli officials were keen to raise issues around antisemitism. Mr Swinney has acknowledged that some felt a meeting, external was “not appropriate”, but stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. In fresh criticism from within the party, veteran MSP Christine Grahame described Mr Robertson as a ""liability"" in a leaked email to the first minister, published by the Scottish Daily Mail, external. Meanwhile, SNP MSP Ruth Maguire told the Herald, external she shared the ""anger"" felt by party members in relation to the meeting. Mr Robertson insisted that it was right for the Scottish government to make its case to the Israeli government. “Scotland's voice does matter,"" he told Good Morning Scotland. ""It won’t change things overnight, of course not, but we have things to say and in this case we call for the Israelis to end what they are doing in Gaza, that humanitarian supplies should be allowed in, that civilians should not be targeted. ”The SNP minister said the meeting was minuted but would be subject to “special considerations that relate to intergovernmental relations”. He added: “I am being absolutely clear about the issues I talked about in the tone and content in which the message was relayed for the need for the Israelis to stop what they are doing in Gaza. ” On the same day that Ms Grudsky posted the photo - 12 August - the Scottish government released a statement referring to areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel.  The Gaza conflict was addressed in the press release, but not in as strong terms as Scottish government ministers had used previously. There was no specific mention of civilian deaths in Gaza or of weapons sales to Israel. In a statement released on Monday announcing that further meetings with Israeli officials would be suspended, Mr Robertson said the government had been ""consistent in our unequivocal condemnation of the atrocities we have witnessed in Gaza"". He told Good Morning Scotland the SNP government had ""ongoing dialogue"" with the Palestinian delegation in the UK. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy previously told BBC Scotland News that it was the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations ""as part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK"".

3242,2024-07-28 17:42:00.769000+00:00,/news/articles/c2e4m6m1r4eo,"At the University of Haifa, less than 50km (30 miles) from Israel’s border with Lebanon, they’re taking no chances. The morning after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers, the university authorities announced that all staff based above the fifth floor in the 30-storey building should work from home. The fear is growing that they’re in the line of fire from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. “In the last war with Hezbollah in 2006, their weapons reached Haifa”, Esther Parpara, a member of staff from the university told me. “This is a dangerous moment. Parents are helping police and guards to patrol kindergartens. I’m avoiding crowded places. We don’t seek war – but Hezbollah want to destroy Israel and the Jewish people, so can we just let them do that without defending ourselves?”Cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon has grown steadily since 8 October, when Hezbollah fired rockets and shells at Israeli sites in solidarity with the Hamas attack on Israel a day earlier. Both groups call for the destruction of the Israeli state. Frequent attacks by Hezbollah have struck northern Israel and the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 war and annexed in 1981. Israel has launched air strikes and missiles into southern Lebanon and beyond, including an overnight wave of attacks apparently in response to the rocket fire on Saturday. The tit-for-tat strikes since October have killed more than 450 people in Lebanon – around 100 of them civilians – while Israel says 23 civilians and 17 soldiers have been killed. The skirmishes had been relatively contained, suggesting both sides were aiming to avoid a head-on confrontation. Thousands mourn children killed in Golan Heights strikeLebanon fears dangerous new phase in Hezbollah-Israel fightingBut now the question is how far Israel will go in response to Saturday’s tragedy, the biggest single loss of life in the cross-border attacks since October. Thousands lined the streets of the town to mourn the young victims, holding flowers and photos as they crowded beside the small white coffins. Hezbollah says it did not fire the deadly rocket, but the Israeli government insists that’s a lie. Following the strike, the Lebanese militants are said to have pre-emptively cleared out some key sites in the south of the country and the eastern Bekaa valley in the anticipation of a large-scale Israeli attack. Israel’s prime minister returned early from the US to chair a security cabinet meeting, amid calls to hit back hard. Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that Hezbollah will “pay a heavy price which it has not paid up to now”. Israel Katz, the foreign minister, said Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, should “pay with his head”, while the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, warned Israel was approaching all-out war with Hezbollah. But Israel knows that the price of such a war with the Lebanese militant group could be devastating – for both sides. Hezbollah is the strongest non-state actor in the region, with an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles in its arsenal. It is Iran’s most important proxy in the Middle East – and an attack by Israel could draw in Tehran, which warned Israel that any “new adventures” in Lebanon could lead to “unforeseen consequences”. And Israeli troops are still stretched in Gaza. Opening up another military front as their munitions run low could simply be unfeasible. On the other hand, some 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from the border region with Lebanon over the past few months – and many are demanding that their government neutralise the threat from Hezbollah. And Mr Netanyahu, whose popularity at home is plummeting, is doing all he can for his political survival. Critics claim he is prolonging the war in Gaza by adding ever more stringent demands on Hamas for a ceasefire deal, knowing that once the fighting stops there, he could face an early election and the end of his career. The fear is that weakened and under pressure from far-right bellicose ministers, he may now be tempted to expand the fight into Lebanon in part for domestic political aims. This is a perilous moment. And while the international calls for restraint from both sides grow louder, this tinderbox region waits to see if the Golan Heights rocket will spark an inferno.",Rocket strike puts Israel and Hezbollah on brink of all-out war,Rocket strike puts Israel and Hezbollah on brink of all-out war,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2e4m6m1r4eo,articles/article_3242.txt,results/article_3242.txt.json

Julian Gao, Ruby Hamill, Daniel Jones and Sayed Shah are all accused of damaging Teledyne's factory in Shipley, which specialises in supplying electronics to the aerospace and defence sectors. At the start of their trial at Bradford Crown Court on Tuesday, prosecutor Gerald Hendron said the four had ""caused extensive damage"" during the protest on 2 April. The defendants are charged with damaging property and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property, including but not limited to crowbars and sledgehammers. The prosecution told Bradford Crown Court that at 05:30 BST on the morning of the protest, the four defendants used angle grinders which caused ""sparks"" as they cut through the gate to Teledyne's Shipley site. They were then said to have gained access to the roof of the building using a ladder. The jury was shown video footage of four people at the site, who the prosecution said were the defendants. Mr Hendron said: ""The footage shows the defendants cutting their way through the fence and climbing onto the roof. ""The four defendants were seen to be laughing to each other in court as the footage was played to the jury. According to the prosecution, more footage seen by the jury showed Mr Jones, of Rossett Road, Crosby, Sefton, and Miss Hamill, of Emu Road in London, Wandsworth, smashing a window to the building. Meanwhile, further footage was shown, which the prosecution said depicted Mr Jones holding a sledgehammer tied to a rope down a hole in the roof and swinging it from side to side. Another video was shown to the jury of Mr Gao, of Dalton Ellis Hall, Manchester, speaking in front of a Palestinian flag following the incident.  In the video, he said: ""Britain has the ability to stop this genocide. If they won't do it, we will. ""He explained the protesters' goal was to have ""no more British weapons in the hands of Israeli soldiers"". Mr Gao warned ""imperialists and oppressors"" that ""you are not safe"" and ""your days are numbered"". The jury also saw footage of another man, who the prosecution said was Mr Shah, of Reedley Road, Reedley, Burnley, saying: ""You look so upset about some tiles, man. The whole of Gaza is being carpet-bombed. ""Mr Hendron told the court that Teledyne ""provided components for the defence and aerospace industries"". He added that ""through British arms export licences"", those components were used ""by countries including Ukraine and Israel"". The prosecution said the defendants were on the roof of the Teledyne factory in Shipley for about 14 hours and caused £571,383 worth of damage.

John Mason had the whip removed over the weekend after posting on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. He told BBC Good Morning Scotland  that the situation in Gaza was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Public Finance Minister Ivan McKee said Mr Mason's comments were offensive, inaccurate and not in line with SNP values.  SNP MSPs will meet to discuss a potential fixed suspension for Mr Mason when parliament reconvenes next month. The withdrawal of the whip means Mr Mason must sit as an independent MSP until it is restored. His post was in response to criticism within the SNP of a meeting which took place between  External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson and Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky. The Times has reported, external that the SNP's Dalkeith branch has lodged a motion to the party conference  - which is being held in Edinburgh next week - calling for Mr Robertson to be suspended from cabinet for bringing the party into disrepute. The outspoken backbencher. who represents Glasgow Shettleston, told Good Morning Scotland: “I completely stand by the tweet, which was making the point this is not genocide. “When we look at other examples of genocide, historically, it's nothing like what's happening in Gaza. “And if Israel wanted to commit genocide, you know, sadly, they could have killed an awful lot more people. ” Mr Mason said Israel, as well as Jews in Scotland, felt “very much under threat”. He added: “I would like to see Scotland, the UK, acting more as a peacemaker, rather than cheering on either side. ”Asked about losing the whip, Mr Mason responded: “Sometimes you have to do the right thing and just take the consequences. ”The MSP, who also met Ms Grudsky, said it was Mr Robertson's role to meet people from all around the world, even those he may disagree with. He said: “We're not going to get any solution to this unless people actually talk to each other. ""Mr Mason said he sought clarity on how the Israeli government was trying to resolve the conflict and what its aims were but was “disappointed” by the deputy ambassador’s answer. He added: “The SNP exists and is united for Scottish independence, and my hope is that we can focus on that. ” Mr McKee said the party was right to remove the whip from Mr Mason over his comment. ""It's deeply offensive, it's hugely inaccurate, and it's not in line with the values of the SNP,"" he told Good Morning Scotland. The SNP minister said Mr Mason should ""educate himself"" by reading the United Nations definition on genocide. He reiterated the Scottish government's calls for a ceasefire, humanitarian corridors and the recognition of the state of Palestine. Mr McKee said Mr Robertson's meeting was held to “hold the Israeli government to account and to make clear long standing and continuing opposition to their behaviour”. However, he acknowledged that “many, many people in the party are very angry about the current situation"". Mr McKee said there would be “no harm” in providing further clarity about what was said at the meeting. He added: “Angus Robertson is a very experienced politician, and I'm sure he'll be reflecting on what was and wasn't discussed at that meeting. ” The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.

3245,2024-09-07 00:05:19.300000+00:00,/news/articles/cewlqpk9e99o,"Israeli forces have been laying tarmac on a key road in Gaza along its southern border - in what some commentators see as a signal that they're not prepared to fully withdraw from the territory any time soon. The road has become a major sticking point in the negotiations for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery, photos and video that show the surfacing of a road along the narrow but strategically important strip of land running the length of Gaza's border with Egypt, long known by its Israeli military codename: the Philadelphi Corridor. Between 26 August and 5 September, satellite imagery captured at regular intervals shows fresh paving along a section of road extending 6.4km inland from the coast along the border fence. A video posted online, external on 4 September which shows construction work, reportedly that evening, along a stretch of the border fence. Heavy machinery can be seen laying fresh tarmac wide enough for two large vehicles to pass. We’ve also compared two images below which show the laying of tarmac before and after. BBC Verify has confirmed the location and that they show the same stretch along the border fence. The corridor includes the Rafah crossing with Egypt - which has been Gaza’s only crossing not directly controlled by Israel and key for aid deliveries. At 12.6 km (7.8 miles) long, it runs adjacent to the Egyptian border from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Mediterranean Sea. While the Israeli military calls it the Philadelphi Route or Axis, Palestinians often refer to it as the Salah al-Din Axis. ""It's not a specific, demarcated area,” says Dr Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King’s College London. “It's a conceptual line. It's understood as land adjacent to the border. ” Israel previously pulled out of the area in 2005, when it withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza. But it re-entered the Philadelphi Corridor on 7 May this year with tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) - months before starting to pave the road. Troops seized control of the Rafah crossing and then began advancing north-west both along the corridor and into the nearby southern city of Rafah. In the past four months, the IDF has destroyed hundreds of buildings near the corridor with air and artillery strikes, as well as through controlled demolitions with explosives and bulldozers. One village - Al Qarya as Suwaydiya - at the Mediterranean end of the border - has been flattened and now appears to be operating as an Israeli base. “Paving the road puts pressure on negotiators and mediators. The Israelis are trying to create a fait accompli,” says Dr Krieg. “It also suggests that Israel is not going to withdraw entirely from the Gaza strip any time soon,” he says. He cites a road built earlier this year by Israeli forces across northern Gaza - known as the Netzarim Corridor. ""If you look at the investments made in the Netzarim Corridor, it's clear they have no intention of withdrawing anytime soon, they've got concrete barriers, forward operating bases with towers and walls - you don't build those if you're planning on withdrawing. ”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the Philadelphi Corridor as a ""lifeline"" for Hamas, and is adamant that Israel maintains a military presence there as a condition of any agreement. At a press conference on Wednesday, he added: ""You want to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities, you can't let Hamas rearm. So you have to control the corridor. ""The IDF’s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said on 14 August that “the Philadelphi Corridor is important because it deals with strengthening our position. We are preparing for all scenarios that the political level may decide. ”Retired Egyptian Major General Dr Samir Faraj, now a commentator on military strategy, said Israel’s aim was “psychological warfare… paving the road is a media war, a war in which Israel sends a message to different parties that they will not leave. “We have asked the Israeli military why it is surfacing the road now but have not received a response. Mr Netanyahu says Hamas has used tunnels underneath the corridor to smuggle weapons and people via Egypt before the 7 October attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. He believes Israeli forces deployed there will prevent the group rearming and ensure it never again poses a threat. In a visit to the corridor last month, Mr Gallant was quoted as saying, external: “We have destroyed 150 tunnels on the Philadelphi Corridor, stretching across the Gaza-Egypt border. ” BBC Verify has located detonations in videos, shared by the IDF, to the Philadelphi Corridor - including one, external which it says shows “destruction of underground infrastructure” - but we are unable to confirm what is being destroyed. We have also seen photos and video - again, shared by the IDF - of one substantial tunnel in the corridor. All of these locations, as well as others along the border, show signs of major disturbances of the surface soil on satellite imagery.

Speaking at a summit of Muslim and Arab leaders the prince also criticised Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Iran. Israel has vehemently denied that its forces are committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a sign of improving ties between rivals Riyadh and Tehran, Prince Mohammed also warned Israel against launching attacks on Iranian soil. Saudi's de facto leader was joined by other leaders present in calling for a total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said it was a “failing of the international community” that the war in Gaza had not been stopped, accusing Israel of causing starvation in the territory. Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al-Saud said: ""Where the international community primarily has failed is ending the immediate conflict and putting an end to Israel’s aggression. ”The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which saw hundreds of gunmen enter southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel retaliated by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A report by the UN’s Human Rights Office found that close to 70% of verified victims over a six-month period in Gaza were women and children. Leaders at the summit also condemned what they described as Israel's “continuous attacks” against UN staff and facilities in Gaza. Last month, the Knesset passed a bill to ban Unrwa, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, from operating in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, accusing the organisation of colluding with Hamas. Several countries, including the US and the UK, have expressed serious concern about the move limiting the agency’s ability to transfer aid to Gaza. In the backdrop of the well-attended summit, is Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Gulf leaders are aware of his closeness to Israel, but they also have good relations with him, and want him to use his influence and his fondness for deal-making to secure an end to conflicts in this region. In Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden, but his track record in the Middle East is mixed. He pleased Israel and angered the Muslim world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as well as the annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. He also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.

The SNP administration has faced criticism after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky. Mr Robertson said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He said the government would not accept further invitations from Israel until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace, on humanitarian assistance and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"".  The meeting prompted a backlash from many SNP figures who have been highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East. But after the fallout last week, First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting in a statement posted online, external. He acknowledged that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”, but stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. Mr Robertson said the meeting was not an attempt to legitimatise the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza. ""The Scottish government has been consistent in our unequivocal condemnation of the atrocities we have witnessed in Gaza,"" he said. “The reality, however, is that this meeting has been taken by many to represent a normalisation of relations between the Israeli and Scottish governments. “As such, it is clear that it would have been better to ensure that the meeting was strictly limited to the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the appalling loss of life in the region. I apologise for the fact that this did not happen. ""He said it would ""not be appropriate to accept any invitation"" for future meetings until ""real progress has been made towards peace"". The apology follows remarks on the conflict from SNP MSP John Mason who posted on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. Mr Mason was suspended from the party's Holyrood group but has said he ""completely"" stands by his remarks. He told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the situation in Gaza was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Mr Robertson met Ms Grudsky on 8 August, but it was four days later before the Scottish government released a statement about it. The statement referenced areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel, and said that Mr Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides"". It said that he had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza"". A spokesperson has since said the delay in going public about the meeting was at the request of the Israeli Embassy on ""security grounds"". In his apology, Mr Robertson said it was his decision to take the meeting, which had been requested by Israel, but the first minister was made aware before it happened. The external affairs minister said: ""My view was that given the Israeli UK Deputy Ambassador had requested a meeting it was an opportunity to express the Scottish government's clear and unwavering position on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and I did exactly that. ""However SNP figures - including former ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - criticised the decision to take the meeting. Mr Robertson said it was really important for a country like Scotland ""where we are aspiring to have an independent state"" to have diplomatic relations and lay out any differences ""when we are in dialogue with countries we are in disagreement with"". Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, welcomed the apology for the diplomatic encounter which was “clearly an astonishing error of judgement”. “Holding a meeting of this kind with the state of Israel at this time looks like normalising acts of genocide,” he said. “It’s really important that the Scottish government has acknowledged what a serious mistake they made holding a meeting of that kind. “But I want this to be about more than the optics of a single meeting, I want it to be about a change of practice. ”He urged the Scottish government to ensure financial support was not given to arms companies which supplied weapons to Israel or were “complicit in illegal settlements”. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy previously told BBC Scotland News that it was the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations ""as part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK"". They said it remained ""resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel"".

3248,2024-09-18 16:00:45.878000+00:00,/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo,"At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country’s health ministry says. Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds. Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members’ pagers exploded on Tuesday. Hezbollah blamed Israel for that attack. Israel has not commented. The attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a ""new phase in the war"" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of the “serious risk of a dramatic escalation” and called on all parties to “exercise maximum restraint”. ""Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,"" he told reporters. There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Hours after Wednesday’s explosions, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country “securely to their homes”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was “opening a new phase in the war” and that the “centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces”. An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends. An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech. Hezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions. It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions. The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries. It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. Wednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel. Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group. Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister. A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well. One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast, external during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds. The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital’s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. The health ministry said the deadly explosions ""targeted walkie-talkies"". A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley. It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM. NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. Video footage showed fire damage to a table and wall, as well as damaged parts of what appeared to be a walkie-talkie bearing the label “ICOM”. Photos on social media from two other locations, external appeared to show the same model. Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought. The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies, external before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group’s war-time emergency communications system. The BBC asked ICOM's UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the company's press office in Japan. The BBC has reached out to ICOM Japan. US and Lebanese sources told the New York Times and Reuters that Israel had planted small amounts of explosives inside the pagers which blew up on Tuesday. An ophthalmologist at one hospital in Beirut told the BBC that at least 60% of the people he had seen had lost at least one eye, with most also losing a hand. “Probably this is the worst day of my life as a physician. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous,"" Dr Elias Warrak said. ""Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage. ”",Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450,Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo,articles/article_3248.txt,results/article_3248.txt.json

He has been taken to a police custody unit outside Gloucestershire. Specialist officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) made the arrest on a property in Gloucester, and also searched a vehicle and address in the area, police said. Gloucestershire Police Assistant Chief Constable Arman Mathieson said the searches aimed to find digital devices for analysis. “The arrest of a serving officer on suspicion of such a serious offence will no doubt cause our communities concern, as it does everyone who works for Gloucestershire Police,"" he added. “The arrest has been made to allow for a prompt and effective investigation to take place and we must not draw any conclusions at this stage. ”It's an offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act to provide support for a proscribed terrorist group. Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah, more commonly known as Hamas, has ruled Gaza since 2007. It was proscribed in its entirety in the UK in 2021. The group was responsible for the 7 October 2023 attacks, which saw hundreds of gunmen enter southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel retaliated by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A week after the 7 October attacks, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism warned speeches at pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK might have glorified terrorism. ""People need to know, if you glorify that you risk committing a really serious terrorism offence,"" Jonathan Hall KC said at the time. Then-home secretary Suella Braverman also said ""the full force of the law"" should be used against support for Hamas.

An Israeli farmer and four Thai agricultural workers were killed when rockets landed near Metula, a town on the border with Lebanon, Israeli and Thai officials said. Later, an Israeli woman and her adult son were killed in an olive grove near Kibbutz Afek, on the outskirts of the coastal city of Haifa. Hezbollah said it had fired barrages of rockets towards the Krayot area north of Haifa and at Israeli forces south of the Lebanese town of Khiam, which is across the border from Metula. The Israeli military identified two projectiles crossing from Lebanon and falling in an open area near Metula on Thursday morning. The Israeli farmer who was killed was named by local media as Omer Weinstein, a 46-year-old father-of-four from nearby Kibbutz Dafna. Thailand's Foreign Minister, Maris Sangiampongsa, said on Friday that four Thai nationals were killed by rocket fire. A fifth Thai worker was injured, he added. Videos posted online showed them being transferred by helicopter to the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said Mr Weinstein and the foreign workers were in an agricultural field near the border fence at the time of the attack. It cited a member of the local emergency response team as saying the Israeli military had permitted them to enter the area despite Metula being inside a closed military zone. The military established the zone at the end of September, just before it launched a ground invasion of Lebanon with the aim of destroying Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure. Thursday’s second rocket attack reportedly hit an agricultural area near Kibbutz Afek, which is about 65km (40 miles) south-west of Metula and 28km from the Lebanese border. The military said a total of 55 projectiles were fired towards the Western Galilee region, where the kibbutz is located, as well as the Central Galilee and Upper Galilee in the early afternoon. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others fell in open areas, it added. According to Haaretz, 60-year-old Mina Hasson and her 30-year-old son, Karmi, were killed by a rocket that hit an olive grove where they were picking olives. A 70-year-old man was also lightly injured by shrapnel and taken to Rambam hospital, according to the Magen David Adom ambulance service. ""We were called to the olive grove and saw a man in his 30s lying on the ground, unconscious,” MDA paramedics Mazor and Yishai Levy told the Jerusalem Post, external. “We began resuscitation efforts while conducting further searches, during which we located another casualty, also in critical condition with multi-system injuries. We provided her with medical treatment and performed resuscitation, but unfortunately, we had to pronounce both of them dead,"" they said. Meanwhile, the head of the Irish military said a UN peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon that houses Irish troops was hit by a rocket fired towards Israel on Wednesday night. The rocket landed inside an unoccupied area of Camp Shamrock, which is 7km (4 miles) from the Israeli border, causing minimal damage on the ground and no casualties, Lt Gen Sean Clancy said. Irish premier Simon Harris said: ""Thankfully everyone is safe but it is completely unacceptable that this happened. Peacekeepers are protected under international law and the onus is on all sides to ensure that protection. ”US envoys in push for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefireThe deadly rocket attacks in northern Israel came as two US special envoys met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss a possible ceasefire deal to end the war with Hezbollah. Netanyahu told Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk that the main issue was what he called Israel's ability to “thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon in a way that will return our residents safely to their homes”, his office said in a statement. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It said it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 2,200 in the past five weeks, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli authorities say more than 60 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket, drone, and missile attacks in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said troops were continuing operations inside southern Lebanon and that aircraft had struck dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout the country. Lebanon’s health ministry meanwhile said Israeli strikes had killed six paramedics in three southern towns. Four from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Society’s Civil Defence branch, which provides emergency services, were killed when Israeli forces targeted a gathering point at Derdghaya junction, it said. A fifth IHS paramedic was killed in an air strike on a vehicle in Deir al-Zahrani, while a strike in Zefta killed a paramedic from the Islamic Risala Scout Association, which is affiliated to the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement, according to the ministry. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. But dozens of paramedics and other emergency workers have been killed and injured since it intensified its air campaign against Hezbollah five weeks ago. The military has previously accused Hezbollah of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters. The IHS has denied having ties to military operations. There were also fresh Israeli strikes near Baalbek, in the eastern Bekaa Valley, a day after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the entire city and two neighbouring towns.

3251,2024-12-01 22:01:06.767000+00:00,/news/articles/ce8984g9gdgo,"Rihab Faour fled her home. Then she fled again. Then a third time. Then a fourth. And by the fourth time, a year after the first, she had been fleeing Israeli bombs for so long that nowhere in Lebanon felt safe. Her journey had begun in October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel. That prompted Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and militant group, to fire rockets into Israel and Israel to retaliate by bombing southern Lebanon. The Israeli bombs fell close enough to Rihab’s village that the 33-year-old and her husband Saeed, an employee of the municipal water company, gathered their daughters Tia, eight, and Naya, six, and fled to Rihab’s parents’ house in Dahieh, a  suburb of the capital Beirut. In Dahieh, for a while, life went on almost as normal, with the exception that Naya and Tia missed their friends, their own beds, their toys and all clothes they had had to leave behind. Most of all they missed going to school, which had been replaced by online learning. They were excited when, back in August, Rihab enrolled them in a new school in Beirut and took them to buy brand new school uniforms. But before their first day could arrive, Israel expanded its bombing of Lebanon to include parts of Beirut, particularly the Dahieh suburb that the family now called home. Israel was assassinating senior Hezbollah figures in the suburb, but it was using large, bunker-busting bombs, each capable of destroying a residential building. In some strikes, Israel dropped dozens of these bombs in one go and flattened entire city blocks. So the Faour family packed up and fled again, this time to a rented house in another Beirut neighbourhood, Jnah. After a powerful air strike in Jnah, they moved to Saeed’s parents’ house in the neighbourhood of Barbour. There, they lived with 17 others in a single house - people piled on people. For Tia and Naya though, now nine and seven, it was a rare joy to be surrounded by their cousins day and night. So much so that even when Rihab’s father, a retired Lebanese army sergeant, found a rental apartment in the Basta neighbourhood just for the four of them, the girls did not want to go. “Naya begged us to stay there with all the family,” Rihab recalled. “We told her we  just had to go for one sleep in this new house, then we would come straight back to the family and to all the children. ”And she offered the girls a bargain - come to stay at the new apartment and you can choose your dinner. So on the way home they stopped for rotisserie chicken and other treats from the shop, and at about 7.30pm, with the streets still alive with people, the family pulled up to a rundown building in Basta in central Beirut. Back in 2006, during the previous war between Israel and Hezbollah, the bombing was confined to certain areas of Lebanon - the south, Dahieh, and some infrastructure targets. This time, as senior members of Hezbollah spread out around the country, Israel bombed them where they went. This brought bombs to places previously thought safe, including parts of central Beirut. None of that was weighing on Tia and Naya as the family unloaded their belongings into the new apartment. For now, the girls were more concerned with returning to their cousins at the earliest opportunity. Unlike Saeed's parents' house, the new Basta apartment had running water and a generator for electricity. The girls were happy when they saw that the family finally had their own space. Rihab and Saeed relaxed a little. Most likely, there would have been an Israeli drone buzzing overhead, but the sound had become so common over Beirut that it was possible to tune it out. Rihab put the food and treats on the table. “We sat down to eat and we were talking and laughing,” she said. “And that was it, my last memory of them. ” The bomb was a US-made Jdam, external. It hit the building on 10 October at about 8pm, half an hour after the family had arrived. It levelled all three storeys and destroyed parts of adjacent buildings and cars, and killed 22 men, women and children, making it the deadliest strike on central Beirut since the beginning of the fighting a year earlier. The Israeli military issued no warning ahead of the strike, so the building was full of people. Israel was reportedly targeting Wafiq Safa, the head of Hezbollah’s co-ordination and liaison unit, but Safa was never reported to be among the dead. He had either survived, or he wasn't there to begin with. The IDF declined to comment on the strike or the lack of a warning ahead of it. Rihab woke up in Beirut’s Zahraa Hospital, unable to move. Her back and arm were badly injured and she needed at least two operations. She drifted in and out of consciousness. Everything in her mind between laughing with her daughters at dinner and waking up in the hospital was blank. While she lay there that night, her family searched Beirut’s hospitals. By midnight, they knew that Saeed and Tia were dead. DNA tests would be required to confirm that Naya had been killed, as well as another girl her age brought to the same hospital, because their injuries prevented straightforward identification. Rihab’s doctors advised the family not to tell her any of this. They were worried that, still facing significant surgery, the news would be too much for her. So for two weeks, as she underwent and then recovered from her operations, her mother Basima reassured her that Saeed and the girls were being treated in different hospitals. But Rihab sensed that something was wrong, and she began to insist on seeing pictures and videos of the girls. “She could feel it in her heart,” Basima said. Eleven days after the strike, the DNA test confirmed that Tia was dead, and on the 15th day a hospital psychiatrist told Rihab that Saeed and the girls were gone. Six weeks later, Rihab was sitting in a stiff plastic chair in an apartment in Beirut, her eyes dark and her face drawn. She was still recovering from her surgeries - to install eight screws into her spine and another three into her arm. She had been lying down for a long time, and now she was trying to sit up more and to walk a little, though every movement caused her pain. Naya’s eighth birthday had been four days earlier. Rihab was passing her time “either crying or sleeping”, she said. But she wanted to talk about her family. “Naya was very attached to me, she followed me wherever I went. Tia loved her grandparents and she was happy if I left her with them. Both of the girls loved drawing, they loved playing with toys, they missed going to school. They would play teacher and student together for hours. ” Above all they loved to watch videos together on TikTok. Rihab and Saeed thought they were still too young to post their own videos online, so Rihab would film them dancing and playing and tell the girls she was posting them on the app, which seemed to satisfy them, for now. Saeed had come into Rihab’s life in 2013. Rihab was raised in Beirut but her family would visit the village of Mays El Jabal in the summer, because the air was cooler there and the village was surrounded by countryside, and that summer she met Saeed through mutual friends. Rihab completed her undergraduate law degree and began studying for a masters, but the couple became engaged and then married, and soon Tia was born, so Rihab put her budding law career on hold. Now, in the midst of her loss, she has tentatively begun to think of studying again. “I am going to need something to fill my days,” she said. Saeed and Tia were buried the day after they died, by Rihab’s father and uncles, in temporary wooden caskets in an unmarked grave in Dahieh. Two weeks later, the men of the family dug again in the same spot and buried Naya. Rihab’s uncle placed two sprigs of artificial cherry blossom atop the grave, for the two girls, and later someone else laid a wreath for a stranger buried beside them. Then an Israeli air strike hit the building directly adjacent to the cemetery and the resultant blast wave and debris smashed gravestones and churned up the earth around them. About the same time, another Israeli air strike hit the family home in Dahieh, destroying several items Rihab had wanted to keep, including two new, unworn school uniforms. Not long after that, it was all over. A ceasefire announced last week allowed thousands of displaced people to stream back to their villages in the south of Lebanon. Rihab and Saeed’s village was heavily bombed by the Israelis and their family home there destroyed, her uncle said, but Rihab cannot return home anyway, because she will be in a backbrace for several more months and cannot travel. As joy spread through Lebanon at the news of the ceasefire, new pictures emerged of Wafiq Safa, the reported target of the bomb that killed Saeed, Tia, Naya and 19 others. Safa had not been seen in public since the strike, but he appeared to be alive and well. Additional reporting by Joanna Mazjoub. Photographs by Joel Gunter.",She fled Israeli bombing four times.

3252,2024-08-20 07:21:21.354000+00:00,/news/articles/c23lgy1k22zo,"The bodies of six hostages being held by Hamas have been retrieved from an ""underground tunnel route"" inside the Gaza Strip, Israel's military has said. A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Peri and British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell were recovered from the Khan Younis area on Monday. Five of their deaths had already been announced by Israel, though it was thought Avraham Munder could still be alive. The overnight recovery operation was carried out by the IDF alongside the security agency Shin Bet. Hamas hostages: Stories of the people taken from Israel During the operation, the IDF said its forces located a 10m (33ft) deep tunnel shaft which led to an ""underground tunnel route"", inside which the bodies were found. They were retrieved after ""prolonged combat in a built-up area and in multi-story buildings"". The six men were all kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Kibbutz Nirim, near Israel’s border fence with Gaza, during Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. In June, Israel confirmed the deaths of Mr Popplewell, 51, Mr Peri, 79, and Mr Metzger, 80. The IDF stated the three men had died during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis. In July, the IDF also confirmed the deaths of Mr Buchshtab, 35, and Mr Dancyg, 76, stating an investigation was being carried out into how they died. Israeli media, citing military sources, reported at the time there was a “high probability” that at least one of the men was killed by Israeli fire. Mati Dancyg, Alexander Dancyg’s son, said on Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government had chosen to ""abandon the hostages in order to survive"". ""Netanyahu chose to sacrifice the hostages. Karma will judge him and he will pay for it, big time,"" he told Israeli public broadcaster Kan. Government estimates suggest there are 105 hostages remaining in Gaza, 71 of whom are thought to be alive. An additional four hostages were already in Gaza prior to 7 October, two of whom are believed to be dead. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement the bodies were retrieved after a ""complex operation"", adding that Israel would keep working on “dismantling Hamas"". Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he sent “heartfelt condolences and a warm embrace” to the families of those whose bodies were returned. ""We must not stop for a moment from working in every way possible to bring back all the hostages,"" he added. In a statement, the Hostage Families Forum said the recovery of the bodies had provided the families with ""necessary closure"", adding that the return of the remaining hostages from Gaza ""can only be achieved through a negotiated deal"". The group called on the Israeli government to ""do everything in its power to finalize the deal currently on the table"". Negotiations over a long-sought-after ceasefire and hostage release deal are ongoing, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arriving in Egypt on Tuesday to discuss a potential deal with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. On Monday, Mr Blinken said Mr Netanyahu had agreed to a US ""bridging proposal"" for a deal, after the pair met in Jerusalem. Mr Netanyahu described the discussion as ""positive"". The IDF said on Monday that it had expanded its operation in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, and the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah. Five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on an internet distribution facility in western Khan Younis on Monday, according to local health officials. A medical source also told AFP news agency that three people were killed in Abasan, east of the city. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,173 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Six hostages' bodies retrieved from Gaza tunnels, says IDF","Six hostages' bodies retrieved from Gaza tunnels, says IDF","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c23lgy1k22zo,articles/article_3252.txt,results/article_3252.txt.json
3253,2024-10-04 05:05:03.268000+00:00,/news/articles/cg7825rk8j9o,"One year on from the 7 October Hamas attacks, tough questions are still being asked within Israel about the deadliest day in its history, when the country's powerful army was caught off guard and swiftly overwhelmed. The BBC has heard accounts given to families of what happened at one military base that guarded the border with Gaza. The Nahal Oz base was overrun by Hamas gunmen on the morning of 7 October and more than 60 Israeli soldiers are reported to have been killed - with others taken hostage. Israel’s military is yet to publish its official inquiry into what happened there that day, but it has already briefed relatives of those killed there, and some have shared those details with the BBC. This is the closest we have to an official account by Israel’s military of what happened on the day. In an attempt to further piece together events, we have also spoken to survivors, seen messages from those who died, and listened to voice recordings reporting the attack as it happened, helping to build a picture of the speed and ferocity of the invasion. The BBC has found: Suspicious activity was spotted by many soldiers at the base before 7 October, not just the young women whose job it was to monitor border camerasSoldiers noticed an abrupt stop to Hamas activity in the days before the attackMany Israeli troops there were unarmed and official protocols had soldiers standing back when under attack, instead of advancingSome surveillance equipment was either out of action or able to be destroyed by Hamas with ease The details we have established raise questions - including why so few soldiers were armed at a base so close to the border, why more wasn’t done to respond to the intelligence and warnings that had been received, how it took so long for reinforcements to arrive, and whether the very infrastructure of the base had left those there unprotected. We put our findings to the IDF, who responded to say it was in the midst of a “thorough investigation into the events of October 7th, including those in Nahal Oz, and the circumstances preceding”. ___On 7 October, Sharon - not her real name - began her shift at Nahal Oz, about a kilometre from the Gaza border fence, at 04:00. She was part of the base’s all-women military unit - known as Tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew - and their role was to study live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the fence. The women worked in shifts in the base’s war room, or Hamal, watching Gaza through a bank of monitors around the clock. The Hamal is a windowless room protected by a solid door and blast walls, with strict security protocols. The IDF has told families of people on the base that day that many military staff were unarmed. Gen Israel Ziv, former head of the IDF's Operations Division, told the BBC that during his service, there would never have been unarmed soldiers in border areas. “It doesn’t make sense… The soldier is about the weapon,” he says. The armed staff at Nahal Oz that day included a unit of infantry soldiers from the IDF’s Golani brigade. The BBC has previously reported that the Tatzpitaniyot had noticed an escalation in suspicious activity on the other side of the fence, but we have now established that these concerns were also shared by other soldiers at the base from different units. Latest coverage as Israel strikes Gaza and BeirutIsraeli kibbutz struggles to heal, one year after 7 OctoberJournalists from across the BBC reflect on the year-long warGaza Strip in maps: How life in the territory has been upendedJeremy Bowen: Middle East is at the edge of a deeper, wider war In the days shortly before 7 October, however, things had gone quiet. “There was nothing and that was frightening us,” one infantry soldier stationed at the base recalls. “Everybody felt that something was strange. It didn’t make sense. ”The IDF's failure to grasp what was happening was down to “a lot of arrogance”, says Gen Ziv, the thought that “Hamas wouldn’t attack, wouldn’t dare, and that even if so, they are not capable”. “We went to sleep on the 6th thinking there’s a cat over there and we woke up on the 7th and there’s a tiger. ”At 05:30, members of the Golani prepared to begin a jeep patrol along the Israeli side of the fence - something they did before dawn every morning. But they were then instructed by their superiors to delay the patrol and stand back because of a threat of anti-tank missiles, three of them have told the BBC. “There was a warning. It was forbidden to go up the route next to the fence,” one recalls. Another Golani, 21-year-old Shimon Malka, said such a warning was unusual but not unheard of, so they gave it little thought. Gen Ziv says it is standard IDF protocol to stand people back during suspected attacks like this so they can “avoid being exposed as a target”. But, he says, “Hamas realised that and used it” to their advantage. He said the base should have been equipped with positions that the Golani could safely respond from. “There are very simple techniques to cover soldiers so they’re under cover but they’re still in a position to react, to not lose sight,” he said. As the Golani waited away from the fence, Sharon began seeing movements among Hamas fighters. But they seemed nothing other than routine - “they also have shifts. ” By 06:20 Hamas had begun shooting rockets, but again Sharon says this did not seem immediately alarming - she had experienced rocket attacks before and the base was well-shielded against them. “It’s usually five minutes of shooting and then a break,” she says. But this time, there was no break. At about 06:30, Sharon says she could see Hamas forces beginning to close in. The Tatzpitaniyot radioed through to the ground forces to alert them. “All stations, four people running to the fence, copy,” one of the young women announced, her voice shaking slightly. ""I am identifying two armed people running to the fence, copy. ” About the same time, Shimon heard the code words for a rocket attack through his radio. His commander ordered they jump from their jeep into a Namer - a type of Israeli armoured personnel carrier - and head towards the fence. But he couldn’t see any incursions and assumed it was just a drill. This so-called iron wall had long been viewed by the IDF and people across Israel as impenetrable, and yet bases along it began reporting breaches. Each of the Tatzpitaniyot on shift at Nahal Oz witnessed between two and five breaches of the section of border fence they were responsible for monitoring, says Sharon. They watched as Hamas fighters made their way inside Israel. Gen Ziv says the ease with which fighters had crossed the fence showed the flaws in a barrier perceived to be impenetrable. “As you saw, two truck-loads could come and push it. It was nothing. Even if there was a minefield of 50 or 60 metres over there, it would have delayed Hamas for a few hours. ” Shortly before 06:40, an observation post at Nahal Oz was hit and damaged by a rocket, according to IDF family briefing notes shared with the BBC. A sniper-sighting system was put into action from the Hamal - the nerve centre of the base - and an officer attempted to shoot remotely at gunmen trying to cross the border, the IDF told families. Infantry officers joined the Tatzpitaniyot in the Hamal, too. Sharon remembers one commander arriving in her pyjamas. And then, as gunmen continued to shoot at surveillance cameras, the monitoring screens in the Hamal started to go dark. The fact that Hamas had been operating in plain sight of these surveillance cameras, along the border in the weeks before, was tactical, says Gen Ziv, in order to “normalise things”. Just 100 metres from where the Tatzpitaniyot were working, Alroy - one of the five IDF observation balloonists on site that morning - was woken by the rockets and the sirens, his father Rafi Ben Shitrit told the BBC. The IDF later provided details of an initial investigation to Alroy’s family about what happened that day. The balloon at Nahal Oz offered a deeper view into Gaza, and was supposed to be operational 24 hours a day. But on 7 October it was one of three along the border that were out of action. “The balloon in Nahal Oz didn't work and no-one was stressed, they were told it would be fixed on Sunday,” says Mr Ben Shitrit. “There was an atmosphere like: ‘Hamas is deterred, even if something happens it's a terrorist infiltration or at most a terrorist squad. ’”Back at her surveillance point, Sharon carried on frantically communicating with soldiers on the ground. “I cried and announced, simultaneously,” she says. She remembers that the commanding officer yelled for “quiet” because some of the young women were losing focus amid the horror. At the fence, Shimon says he followed the radio directions. He still couldn’t understand why the young woman’s voice he was hearing sounded so panicked. “I could feel the stress, but I couldn’t see anything. ”When his unit reached the place the Tatzpitaniyot had directed them to, they saw Hamas trucks breaking through the fence. “They started to shoot at us. Maybe five trucks. ”The soldiers shot back and ran over those on motorbikes. Shortly after 07:00 came the moment everyone feared and nobody could imagine. Hamas gunmen were at the door of the Hamal. “Get up, the terrorists are at the door,” Sharon remembers being told. The Tatzpitaniyot were ordered to abandon their positions and head to an office inside the war room. Gen Ziv says that those higher up in the military did not put enough emphasis on defending the bases themselves, focusing instead on external patrols. “That was part of the whole mess because once the enemy surprised them and went into the base they were not ready. The whole thing collapsed,” he says. At about 07:20 what was known as the shield - a bomb shelter outside the Hamal - was attacked. Among those sheltering inside were some off-duty Tatzpitaniyot, who were being protected by “four female warriors”, according to a WhatsApp message sent at 07:38 by one of the Tatzpitaniyot sheltering there and seen by the BBC. There were no further messages from her in the group. The IDF told families that these “female warriors” were the only armed people hiding in the shelter - and they kept Hamas fighters at bay with their gunfire until a grenade explosion killed one of the commanders and injured others inside. At this point, about 10 of the soldiers managed to escape the shelter and locked themselves in the accommodation barracks. Everyone else in the shield was either killed or captured by Hamas. Shimon and his commander headed back to the base, but they still weren’t aware of the scale of what was happening. The IDF would later brief the family of one of those killed at Nahal Oz that the attack on the base was begun by drone strikes, and action by 70 fighters from four directions, and that scores more joined as the morning went on. Up and down the Gaza Strip, thousands crossed into Israeli territory. On his way back to base Shimon says he began to comprehend the scale of the attack. “When we got to the base, everything was burned,” he says. In the office inside the Hamal, Sharon says the group of about 20 soldiers tried to calm each other down. Meanwhile, they made repeated attempts to call for more support. “I guess [someone] said something like ‘There’s no backup, no-one can come,’ and I remember my officer said ‘We don’t need backup, we need rescue. ’” Shortly before 08:00 an Israeli drone, known as a Zik, arrived, but it had difficulty distinguishing between Israeli soldiers and Hamas, according to the IDF account, which meant it was slower to attack its intended targets. At about the same time, an attack began on the Hamal, with lots of shooting. Those armed fought at the doors of the building to prevent Hamas from getting inside. The fighting continued for about four hours. Meanwhile, Shimon says he and other soldiers fighting at the base were completely outnumbered. There was no sign of reinforcements. “It was all vague. ”At about 09:00, the Golani headed to the base’s dining room where the Tatzpitaniyot had told them most of the gunmen were hiding. Relatives would later be told by the IDF that there were 150 gunmen to every 25 combat soldiers entering Nahal Oz that day. “What Hamas was doing that morning was swarming,” says Gen Ziv. “There were over 70 different breaches… over 3,000 terrorists… They knew they didn’t have the quality so they had to go quantity. ”A video, which Israeli media reports was filmed around this time, shows young surveillance officers at Nahal Oz, who had been captured by armed Hamas. “You dogs, we will step on you,” one man is heard saying as the women’s hands are tied, their faces against the wall. Nineteen-year-old Naama Levy, who had only started at the base the previous day, pleads that she has “friends in Palestine”, her face covered in blood. The footage shows the women being dragged into a waiting vehicle and driven away. It is devastating for Naama’s mother to watch. “The wounds, the blood, what she was saying, what the terrorists were saying to them, the horror of those moments,” says Dr Ayelet Levy. Gen Ziv says the Tatzpitaniyot at Nahal Oz “were amazing - the mistake was the system, the commanders, not them”. More than three hours after the attack had begun, at 09:45, an IDF helicopter started firing at the Hamas gunmen, officers told grieving relatives. It fired into the base 12 times. Shimon and six others, including their commander, drove out of the base and returned in formation on foot. He says they were fired on “from all directions”. Through the sound of automatic gunfire would come a series of single shots, fired by a Hamas sniper they couldn’t see. “Every time he shot, one of my friends got a bullet in the head,” he says. Shimon says he was the only one of those fighting alongside him to survive, and he too, had a near miss. “A bullet passed right by my head… I could hear the bullets hitting the concrete around me and feel the heat from them. ”At this point, he says his radio was no longer operational. Gen Ziv describes the day as a “perfect storm”. “For so many hours the backup was not there because nobody knew exactly what was going on and where to send the backup,” he explains. Shimon escaped the scene and moved to a sniper's position before joining with soldiers from another unit who went to protect a kibbutz. Back in the Hamal, or war room, there was a significant development at about 11:00. The electricity was cut which meant the locks to the doors, which were on an electric system, were released. It left the war room wide open, according to the IDF account given to several families. Hamas fighters began shooting inside and throwing grenades. One was killed in a face-to-face knife fight with a Golani soldier, the IDF told families. Gen Ziv said at the point that soldiers were relying on door locks for their safety, the broader military system had “already failed”. In the IDF’s briefing to families it said “terrorists threw a flammable substance into the Hamal and set it on fire”. “The smoke was really thick. Everyone started to cough and suffocate. People start to fall and faint,” recalls Sharon. One mother says she was told by the IDF that a “toxic substance” had been used by Hamas, external in the attack, though others were not aware of this detail or said the IDF had since changed its account on this. At about 12:30, seven people in the Hamal - including Sharon - managed to feel their way to the toilet window and climb out, according to accounts of those there that day. There, she and the other survivors waited for more to follow. But no-one came. Sharon was the only survivor among the Tatzpitaniyot on shift that day. One other young woman in the unit, who was at the base but not working that morning, also survived. By the end of 7 October, the military had regained control, but many of those stationed there did not survive the day. Seven Tatzpitaniyot were taken back to Gaza as hostages, where one was killed, another rescued and five still remain. Across Israel that day, about 1,200 people - including more than 300 soldiers - were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The Nahal Oz dead were to include Alroy the balloonist and four comrades, who had engaged in a lengthy battle with Hamas, says his father, citing information given to him by the IDF. They managed to kill close to 10 gunmen, he said, but the five were outnumbered and were all found dead inside a mobile shelter at 14:30. The war room - which had been designed as a safe space for the base’s units - was destroyed. Photos and videos show it charred, the screens the Tatzpitaniyot had been carefully monitoring, blackened. Bone fragments were found among the ashes there. The survivors and the families of those killed and kidnapped are left with unanswered questions about how it went so wrong.

3254,2024-08-27 02:07:57.666000+00:00,/news/articles/c89w851xw5ko,"At least five people, including two children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike on an urban refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed the strike, on Nur Shams camp near the city of Tulkarm, saying it had targeted what it called the command room of a ""terror cell"". Separately, the health ministry said one person had been shot dead and three injured during an attack by Israeli settlers near Bethlehem. The IDF said it was investigating the reports. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The UN said last Wednesday, external that 128 Palestinians, including 26 children, had been killed in Israeli air strikes in the West Bank since 7 October. Overall, 607 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, including 11 by Israeli settlers, over the same period, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine members of Israeli forces and five settlers, were also killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the UN. Another 10 Israelis were killed in attacks in Israel by Palestinians from the West Bank. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that an Israeli drone carried out the strike on a house in Nur Shams camp on Monday night and four loud explosions were heard. The Palestinian health ministry identified the five people killed as Mohannad Qarawi, 19, Jibril Jibril, 20, Adnan Jaber, 15, Mohammed Yusif, 49, and Mohammed Elayyan, 16. Jibril Jibril was a member of Hamas who had been released from an Israeli prison in November as part of an exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, according to the Palestinian reports. Mohannad Qarawi was also identified as a Hamas member. Nur Shams has been targeted by the IDF several times in recent months. In April, the Palestinian Red Crescent said 14 people had been killed in a two-day Israeli operation there. Later on Monday, the health ministry said a 40-year-old man named Khalil Salem Khalawi was shot dead during an attack by Israeli settlers in the Palestinian village of Wadi Rahhal, south of Bethlehem. Three other people were wounded, it added. Wafa cited the head of the village council, Hamdi Ziada, as saying that shots were fired as settlers attacked homes near the local boys’ school. He also claimed that Israeli forces had entered the village to provide protection for the settlers and fired tear-gas at residents. Israel’s Ynet news website reported that Mr Khalawi was an Israeli Arab and that he was shot dead by IDF soldiers who arrived in Wadi Rahhal following a claim by settlers that stones had been thrown at an Israeli vehicle. Settlers also clashed with residents of the village, it said. The IDF said it was looking into reports, which come two weeks after a Palestinian man was shot dead during a settler attack on the village of Jit. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.

Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister praised the ""dignity and determination"" of the families of those taken captive by Hamas. He said of them: ""Their pain is as acute today as it was a year ago. They live it every day. ""Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostages when the group launched a surprise assault on communities in southern Israel. A British-Israeli woman is among 97 hostages still unaccounted for. Sir Keir described the 7 October attacks as being ""born of hatred"" and ""targeted not just at individuals, but at Jewish communities, at their way of life and at the state of Israel, the symbol of Jewish security to the world"". He paid tribute to 15 British citizens killed in the initial raids, and another who has since died in captivity.  A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for. Among them is Mandy Damari, a 28-year-old British-Israeli woman. Earlier on Monday, her mother Mandy described the ""living hell"" of not knowing her daughter's fate, and called on the British government to do more to secure the release of hostages. She told an event in London: “How is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year? ""Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own. ""Foreign Secretary David Lammy attended the same event. He said: ""It is a day of deep reflection and pain thinking about 7 October, the worst attack on the Jewish community since the Holocaust. "" The 7 October attacks led to the Israeli government launching an invasion into Gaza in an attempt to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas. In the months that followed, hate crime against Jews and Muslims in the UK rose amid protests and enflamed community tensions. During his Commons statement on Monday, Sir Keir said his government would ""stand with all communities here in the UK, against hatred of Jews and Muslims"". The prime minister reflected on victims in the conflict which has broken out in the Middle East in the aftermath of the attack. Israeli assaults on Gaza have killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and war has spread to Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union - began almost daily rocket attacks against Israel in support of Hamas shortly after the 7 October attacks. Hundreds of people have died in Lebanon in recent days in Israeli bombardments. The prime minister said: ""Nobody in this House can truly imagine what it feels like to cower under the bodies of your friends, hoping a terrorist won't find you minutes after dancing at a music festival. ""No one can truly imagine seeing your city, your homes, your hospital, your businesses obliterated, with your neighbours and family buried underneath. ""It is beyond our comprehension - and with that should come humility. ""Sir Keir said the government would continue to push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and a long-term diplomatic solution which provides security to Israel, alongside side a Palestinian state.",Starmer reflects on 'sorrow and grief' one year after Hamas attack,Starmer reflects on 'sorrow and grief' one year after Hamas attack,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3618lnj2ygo,articles/article_3255.txt,results/article_3255.txt.json

""Stop the violence. Step back from the brink,"" the prime minister said in his maiden speech to the UN General Assembly, despite Israeli ministers’ rejection of an international proposal for a temporary pause in fighting. Sir Keir told world leaders a ceasefire would provide space for a diplomatic settlement to avoid a regional conflict in the Middle East. Fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, following the deadliest escalation of cross-border attacks in decades. More than 600 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon since Monday, including at least 92 people on Thursday, according to local authorities. Hezbollah has responded by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel. Israeli politicians have broadly rejected the idea of a ceasefire after a 12-strong bloc - including the UK, US and other allies proposed a three-week pause in fighting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the country's military to continue fighting with ""full force"" as he landed in New York on Thursday. Addressing the UN General Assembly there, Sir Keir said an immediate ceasefire was needed ""to provide space for a diplomatic settlement"". He warned that the conflict could spill over into a war ""no-one can control and with consequences that none of us can foresee"". Elsewhere in his speech, Sir Keir vowed to return the UK to “responsible global leadership” by recommitting to “the UN, to internationalism, to the rule of law”. He also promised to restore Britain’s “commitment to international development”, and set out plans to change the international financial system “to deliver a fairer deal for developing countries"". Around 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began, sparked by the war in Gaza. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, in addition to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. The UK has urged British nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately because of the escalation, however some have told the BBC of their difficulty in fleeing the country. Cross-border fighting continued on Thursday, with the Israeli army saying it had struck Hezbollah targets in parts of Lebanon's south and east, and on the Lebanese-Syrian border. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the Kiryat Ata settlement, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel. Israel’s military chief told troops on Wednesday that strikes targeting Hezbollah could pave the way for them to “enter enemy territory”.

In a statement announcing that the operation was under way on Saturday, Israel's military spokesman said Israel had the ""right and duty"" to respond and that its defensive and offensive capabilities were fully mobilised. Iranian state media has confirmed that explosions have been heard in the west of Tehran. But there's no clarity as yet in precisely what the targets have been and whether they have been successfully hit by Israel. News sites close to Iran's Revolutionary Guards says that some military bases in the west and south-west of the Iranian capital have been targeted.

For now, at least, Iranian media is  playing down the impact. The true nature of what has happened is only likely to trickle out bit by bit from the Iranian authorities. Israel may move more quickly to disclose the details of its attack.  But that may depend on whether or not it plans to carry out another wave. The Pentagon has given a briefing that the US was made aware of Israel's plans beforehand and that there was no US involvement in the operation. That's significant in Washington's efforts to try to prevent the conflict between Israel and Iran escalating into a confrontation that could move ever closer to all-out war. The US will also be waiting for the dust to settle to see if Israel's targets were limited to military targets or went beyond that to include facilities linked to Iran's nuclear programme - which could trigger another major response from Tehran. For now - on the scant evidence that is available - Israel may have heeded Washington's warnings and reined in some of its more ambitious plans to cause maximum pain to the Iranian authorities. It's now up to the Iranian leadership to decide how to respond. The semi-official Tasnim news agency has said there's no doubt Israel will face what it called a ""proportional reaction"".

Members of Cambridge for Palestine entered Greenwich House on Madingley Rise, Cambridge, which is part of the University of Cambridge, on Friday. The group claimed the university had not acted on previous agreements to review investments in relation to the defence and arms industry. The University of Cambridge said it recognised the importance of peaceful protest but said forceful entry of buildings was ""unacceptable"". Greenwich House is an administrative building which includes finance operations.  In May students set up a protest camp outside King's College and the Senate House in Cambridge, to demonstrate against the university's investments. The protests in May ended after an agreement was made for a working group, which would include students, to examine issues related to the university’s approach to investments in, and research funded by, the defence industry. Cambridge for Palestine has accused the university of breaking parts of the negotiated terms for ending the earlier encampment and stalling negotiations. In a statement the group said: ""Cambridge for Palestine repeats its calls for an immediate end to our university's complicity in Israel's ongoing genocide, occupation, and ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Enough is enough. ""It also made demands that the university publicly condemn Israel's actions in Gaza, that it make good on its agreement with the Cambridge for Palestine encampment and carry out an analysis of its investments.

Prof Nizam Mamode, from Brockenhurst, Hampshire, worked at Nasser hospital for a month in August and September and has just returned to the UK. The 62-year-old said each day he saw between 10 and 20 deaths and up to 40 people with serious injuries. The former clinical lead of transplant surgery at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London said most of the victims were women and children. Prof Mamode said the hospital, which was raided by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) in February, was the last one in Gaza that was ""still functioning on a significant level"". He said doctors were coping with one or two mass casualty events a day, following bombings and drone attacks. The surgeon, who has previously worked in other conflict zones, said it was ""unlike anything that I've ever seen before"". He recalled: ""It was a complete shock. The moment you cross the border into Gaza it's as if an atomic bomb has dropped. ""All you see is rubble for miles around. You're driving for 30 minutes through this landscape, there's hardly anybody around, just a few armed looters. ""And then you come to the central area of Gaza where you've got a million and a half people just crammed together in a very, very small area, with so-called tents on every piece of land available. ""We were dealing mainly with trauma victims. . . people who were missing their arms, their legs. ""I think one of the things that shocked me most was the fact that this just continued day after day and has been going on like this for a year now. ""There was no real let-up. Pretty much every day we'd be dealing with these casualties. "" Prof Mamode said he was willing to return to Gaza if called upon. His visit was arranged with British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, which has been active since 1982. Last year Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. The incursion was to become the deadliest attack in Israeli history and as of September 2024, around 100 people are still believed to be held hostage in Gaza. Israel then launched a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military insists it does not target civilians and has accused Hamas of using the population as a human shield.

The ministry said women and children were among the dead from Tuesday evening’s attack on the Mezzeh neighbourhood, which houses the Iranian embassy and other diplomatic facilities. Israel's military has not commented. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 13, including nine civilians and two members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which is a key ally of Iran and Syria's government. The UK-based monitoring group said the strike targeted an apartment frequented by leaders of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance"". Syria’s state news agency, Sana, cited a military source as saying that the building was hit by three missiles launched by Israeli aircraft from the direction of the occupied Golan Heights. Photographs from the scene showed emergency services personnel inspecting significant damage to apartments on the first, second and third floors. ""I was on my way home when the explosion happened and communications and electricity were cut off, so I could no longer contact my family,"" electrician Adel Habib, 61, who lives in the building, told AFP news agency. ""These were the longest five minutes of my life until I heard the voices of my wife, children and grandchildren. ""The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights identified the civilians killed as a Yemeni doctor, his wife and their three children, as well as a woman and her child, a female doctor and a man. Iran's embassy said no Iranian citizens were among the casualties. On Wednesday, a Syrian police officer was killed in an Israeli strike near the south-western city of Quneitra, according to Sana. In the evening, the Israeli military put out a statement saying it had conducted a strike in the Quneitra area that killed a man called Adham Jahout, whom it identified as a terrorist in Hezbollah’s “Golan Terrorist Network”. As part of his role, it claimed, Jahout relayed information from Syrian government sources to Hezbollah and transmitted intelligence to facilitate the group's operations against Israeli targets in the Golan Heights. Last week, another Israeli strike in Mezzeh reportedly killed the son-in-law of the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hassan Jaafar Qassir. Israel has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups such as Hezbollah. The Israeli strikes in Syria have reportedly been more frequent since the start of the war in Gaza last October, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Israeli air and artillery strikes have targeted Syrian territory on 104 occasions since January, killing at least 296 people and resulting in the damage or destruction of about 190 targets, including weapons depots, vehicles and Iran-backed militia headquarters.

3262,2024-09-18 10:33:01.528000+00:00,/news/articles/c9qvl3vlvlvo,"The race to find the maker of the pagers that exploded in Lebanon has taken an unexpected turn - towards a Taiwanese company few had heard of until this morning. At least 12 people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured in Tuesday's explosions targeting members of the armed group Hezbollah, which set off a geopolitical storm in the Middle East. Caught in the crisis, Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo's founder Hsu Ching-Kuang flatly denied his company had anything to do with the attacks. Instead, Mr Hsu has said he licensed his trade mark to a company in Hungary called BAC Consulting to use the Gold Apollo name on their own pagers. BBC attempts to contact BAC have so far been unsuccessful. LIVE: Latest updates on the Hezbollah pager explosionsWhat we know about the attack in LebanonWatch: Video appears to show explosion at supermarketBowen: Tactical triumph for Israel, but Hezbollah won't be deterredWhat is Hezbollah in Lebanon and why is it fighting with Israel? “You look at the pictures from Lebanon,” Mr Hsu told reporters outside his firm's offices on Wednesday. ""They don’t have any mark saying Made in Taiwan on them, we did not make those pagers!”The offices of Gold Apollo are in a large new business park in a non-descript suburb of Taiwan's capital, Taipei. They look the same as any of the thousands of small trading companies and manufacturers that make up a huge chunk of the island's economy - except for the two police officers posted at the entrance, ready to fend off the large gaggle of reporters and TV crews squatting outside. On the walls of Gold Apollo's office are posters of the company’s products – a montage of small boxy plastic devices with little grey LCD screens. They are all pagers.  Until this morning the company’s website had a page devoted to each, extolling its virtues and practicalities. But as soon as news broke that Gold Apollo was the alleged source of the devices used in the attacks in Lebanon,  the website went offline. Mr Hsu said it was pagers made by BAC Consulting that were used in the Lebanon attacks. He told reporters that his company had signed an agreement with BAC Consulting three years ago. The money transfers from BAC had been ""very strange"", he added. There had been problems with the payments, which had come through the Middle East, he told reporters, but he did not go into detail. Initially, he said, BAC wanted to buy pagers from Gold Apollo to sell in Europe. But after about a year they came up with a new plan to make their own pagers and licensed Gold Apollo's name. ""We only provide brand trademark authorisation and have no involvement in the design or manufacturing of this product,” a statement from Gold Apollo said. But the fact there is now a team from the Taipei investigation bureau inside his office – with large numbers of cardboard boxes - suggests the Taiwanese authorities are not entirely reassured. Nevertheless, Mr Hsu’s statement that his company didn’t make the devices is plausible.  Taiwan’s manufacturing system is a complex maze of small companies, many of which do not actually make the products they sell. They may own the brand name, the intellectual property and have research and design departments. But most of the actual manufacturing is farmed out to factories in China or Southeast Asia. Pagers are also hardly cutting-edge technology – there are many companies across the world capable of making them. They are small radio receivers with LED screens that can receive and display messages.  In the 1980s and 1990s electronic pagers were considered to be the latest tech, used by tens of millions of people. Before mobile phones, companies used pagers to send short text messages to employees in the field.   But in the last two decades the rise of the smart phone has pushed pagers to the brink of extinction. They are now a niche device holding on in places like hospitals – where they remain a cheap and reliable method for messaging doctors and nurses, even when other communication lines are disrupted. Starting in the late 2000s, Gold Apollo too started moving away from making electronic pagers and started manufacturing other short-range radio devices – particularly for restaurants. The company’s most successful product now is a round disc that is handed to customers in food courts and restaurants once they place an order - it lights up and vibrates when their order is ready.  It's likely that Gold Apollo's  brand name - as a reliable pager manufacturer - was useful in selling the pagers that ended up with Hezbollah.  But there are still more questions than answers in this extraordinary story. We know almost nothing about BAC Consulting - who is or was behind it?

Fragments of the pagers that blew up had labels which pointed to Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo. But the firm denied making the devices used in the attack. The Lebanese government says 12 people, including two children, were killed and nearly 3,000 injured in the explosions on Tuesday. The incident, along with another attack involving exploding walkie-talkies, was blamed on Israel and marked a major escalation in the conflict between the two sides. ""The components for Hezbollah's pagers were not produced by us,"" Taiwan's economy minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters on Friday. He added that a judicial investigation is already under way. ""I want to unearth the truth, because Taiwan has never exported this particular pager model,"" Taiwan foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung said.

He said he licensed his trade mark to a company in Hungary called BAC Consulting to use the Gold Apollo name on their own pagers. The BBC's attempts to contact BAC have so far been unsuccessful. Its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono told the US news outlet NBC that she knew nothing and denied her company made the pagers. The Hungarian government has said BAC had ""no manufacturing or operational site"" in the country.

Japanese handheld radio manufacturer Icom has distanced itself from the walkie-talkies that bear its logo, saying it discontinued production of the devices a decade ago.

Fields a few miles from the border that yesterday were full of dozens of tanks, are emptying - almost the entire fighting force there has gone, and a column of armoured vehicles were preparing to move out. On Sunday night, helicopters and jets flew low across this border, to the regular “crump” of artillery and occasional loud explosions. Hezbollah says it fired rockets at Israeli troops this morning along the border at Metula and Avivim, and there were also several loud interceptions directly above us, a little further south. At an army checkpoint outside Metula, Israeli artillery was still firing this morning as a group of soldiers waited to go in. Israel’s army says its ground forces crossed the border last night in a “limited and targeted” incursion, but it’s not immediately clear how many units have been sent in, and where. A senior security official said today that the operations were “very limited in scope” and said there were currently “no clashes”. When asked how far into Lebanon the Israeli forces had gone, he declined to be specific but said they were “very close, walking distance - not far in”, and that the numbers involved were not those of a large ground invasion, but something more limited. Israel says its aim is to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure along the border that it says poses an imminent threat to Israeli communities. But sending ground troops even a short distance into Lebanon carries significant risks to its army. Hezbollah - well armed with anti-tank missiles and mines - has been preparing to meet Israeli forces on this terrain for years. What’s not clear is how far Israel is preparing to push forward into Lebanese territory, whether its aim is to remove the threat of infiltration from Hezbollah fighters and tunnels, or whether it is planning to push the group further north - a much bigger and riskier undertaking for Israeli army.",Tanks and jets on the move at Israel-Lebanon border,Tanks and jets on the move at Israel-Lebanon border,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8ljj21n33o,articles/article_3264.txt,results/article_3264.txt.json

But police say he fired shots outside the offices of Israeli tech firm Elbit Systems. “He was basically caught in the act,” said police spokesman August Brandt, who said the shots were being investigated as an “attempted murder and weapons offence”. Kalleback on the outskirts of Gothenburg is a fairly sleepy residential neighbourhood with upmarket developments, a supermarket and a few offices. Nobody was hurt and little more is known about why a child might have opened fire on an otherwise quiet Thursday morning, outside an Israeli company that sells defence and homeland security solutions. But this was no isolated incident. In fact there have been several this year. Earlier this month, Israel’s embassies were targeted both in Sweden and neighbouring Denmark. First there was a shooting outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, then two Swedish teenagers aged 16 and 19 were arrested in Copenhagen after hand grenades were detonated near the embassy there. Nobody was hurt, but Sweden's security service Sapo said immediately that Iran may have had a hand in both. Sapo head of operations Fredrik Hallstrom said Tehran’s involvement was an “objective hypothesis”. Months ago Sapo accused Iran of recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out attacks on Israeli or Jewish interests. Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the allegations as “unfounded and biased” and based on what it labelled misinformation emanating from Israel. Many of the suspects have been teenagers, and some as young as 13 and 14. “To understand why we see young Swedish teenagers attacking Israeli companies and embassies we need to first acknowledge that we have had an ongoing gang conflict here in Sweden for a long time,” says Diamant Salihu, an investigative crime journalist with Swedish public service television SVT. One of Sweden’s most violent criminal gangs, known as Foxtrot, has brought a wave of violence to the streets of Sweden, often involving teenagers tasked with criminal errands ranging from shooting at the door of a rival, to detonating explosives to contract killings. That spiralled in 2023 when Foxtrot gang leader Rawa Majid entered into a deadly feud with Ismail Abdo, a former friend who had become leader of a rival gang known as Rumba. When Abdo’s mother was murdered at her home in Uppsala, north of Stockholm, in September last year, it opened a darker, increasingly violent chapter in Sweden’s gang wars. A pair who were 15 and 19 at the time were found to have carried out the murder. Majid fled abroad facing an international arrest warrant, an Interpol red notice and a growing list of enemies. Born in Iran to Kurdish Iraqi parents, he had moved as a child to Sweden with his family. He left Sweden for Turkey in 2018 then moved to Iran last year. Israeli’s Mossad intelligence agency alleged that Majid had been working with Iran for months. It has blamed both his and Abdo’s gangs for the recent attacks. When counter-intelligence chief Daniel Stenling said Sapo “can now confirm that criminal networks in Sweden are proxies that Iran uses,” Iran summoned Sweden’s highest diplomat in Tehran in protest. Sweden has also sought the arrest of Majid’s rival, Ismail Abdo, who was arrested in Turkey last May but reportedly released on bail. Journalist Diamant Salihu says Tehran has sought to persuade the gang to “commit crimes for the regime,” although Abdo’s gang has denied involvement with Iran. While the gangs themselves may have been put under pressure by a foreign power, that cannot be the case for the teenagers who have become caught up in the wider Swedish problem of gang crime. An estimated 14,000 people in Sweden are caught up in criminal gangs, according to a police report from this year, external, and a further 48,000 people are said to be connected to them. “Today's 13- and 14-year-olds who commit these grotesque offences were three or four years old 10 years ago,” conservative Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a televised debate of party leaders on public TV last weekend. The debate turned into a blame game between the centre-right coalition currently in power and their predecessors on the centre left. Social Democrat former Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson called for a “completely new approach” but Kristersson said “a very large extent of this is a problem linked to poor integration; and the integration problem is built on too high immigration”. A disproportionate amount of gang members are men from immigrant backgrounds, but this has shifted, to the extent that Diamant Salihu says young people and adults from ethnic Swedish backgrounds are increasingly becoming involved. Criminology specialist David Sausdal of Lund University, in the south of Sweden, says it has become increasingly difficult to monitor networks as they have become fragmented online, dragging people into a “gang gig-economy”. ""The people involved in it are just hired guns, paid for services. They deliver a pizza or a hand grenade as good as they can. “They're not super talented at it, they’re not motivated by inner hate or conflict as such. They're just doing a job. ”It is that kind of change in Swedish society that is worrying police and politicians alike. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer has spoken of three parallel threats to Sweden’s security – terror, state actors and organised crime. But the latest gang attacks, in David Sausdal’s words, go against conventional understanding of what has previously driven serious crime.",Teenage guns for hire: Swedish gangs targeting Israeli interests,Teenage guns for hire: Swedish gangs targeting Israeli interests,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e85l701y3o,articles/article_3265.txt,results/article_3265.txt.json

The Israeli military says it carried out two separate air strikes in the north of the territory targeting members of armed groups.  There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The local health ministry says at least 600 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - have been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. At least 17 Israelis, including 12 security forces personnel, have also been killed in the West Bank, according to a UN tally. Palestinian Authority spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeinah condemned the recent violence, as well as alleged torture and abuse of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as the ""crossing of all red lines"". Footage from Aqaba, near Tubas, shows a house stained with blood. Locals say that a boy of 14 was among four killed after a dawn raid by Israeli forces resulted in violent confrontations.  Meanwhile, in Jenin - a regular flashpoint - an Israeli aircraft attacked what the Israeli military described as “terrorist cells” killing at least five.  A column of Israeli armoured personnel carriers was filmed entering the city, while armoured bulldozers dug up roads.  Tensions remain very high across the West Bank.

3267,2024-09-01 15:37:25.200000+00:00,/news/articles/cze5x793569o,"Tens of thousands of people have rallied across Israel after the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip were recovered by soldiers, causing national outrage. Protesters - many clad in Israeli flags - descended on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities, accusing PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his government of not doing enough to reach a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. Sunday's protests were largely peaceful - but crowds broke through police lines, blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv. This comes as a major Israeli labour union, Histadrut, called for a nationwide general strike on Monday, pressing for a hostage deal. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier that the six bodies were found on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The hostages were identified as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. The IDF said they had been killed shortly before its troops reached them on Saturday. This triggered Sunday's protests, with crowds accusing the government and Mr Netanyahu personally of failing to save the remaining hostages.  In Tel Aviv, protesters broke through police lines on to Ayalon Highway late on Sunday. Some people scaled buses and bins to gain a vantage point over the march, while others surrounded someone wearing a mask of Mr Netanyahu, chanting: “Alive, alive, we want them alive. ” One demonstrator held a sign which read: ""You are the head. You are to blame"". Crowds also chanted slogans including ""policemen, policemen who are you protecting"" and ""shame, shame"". Some set fires on the road and draped yellow ribbons - a symbol of solidarity with the hostages. Naama Lazimi, a Labor Party lawmaker, told the BBC she was lightly injured after police  let off stun grenades and she fell down. She described the protests as “significant and important”. but said the “question is what happens tomorrow”. Among the protesters was Eli Shtivi, whose son Idan is being held hostage in Gaza. “We hope that those who make the decisions will wake up,” he told the BBC. “We don’t have time any more. ”He said people from all strands of Israeli society took part in Sunday's rallies, united in wanting the hostages returned. “I miss my child so much. All the families are kind of hostages too,” Mr Shtivi said. Noga Burkman, another demonstrator in Tel Aviv, told the BBC she ""couldn't stay at home any more"". ""People understand that now we need to break the rules and do something,"" she said, adding that ""tonight is just the beginning"". Elsewhere, in the city itself, the gathering saw a diverse mix of protesters, with one group of young scouts leading chants. In Jerusalem, a massive crowd of demonstrators gathered outside the prime minister's office.  One 50-year-old man told the BBC that the demonstrations were far bigger than any previous ones. ""It’s a totally different game today,"" he said. ""A different scale to anything before. "" Among those present at the protests in Tel Aviv was 24-year-old Yotam Peer, whose 21-year-old brother was killed on 7 October in the Hamas attacks. He told the BBC: ""After we heard about the six hostages, we couldn’t be silent any more. It’s really important. We don’t have a choice any more. ""Local media reported that opposition leader Yair Lapid was present. The former prime minister, who leads the Yesh Atid party, earlier backed calls for a mass strike to force Mr Netanyahu into a deal over the release of the hostages. Calling the general strike, union leader Arnon Bar-David said: ""We must reach a deal. A deal is more important than anything else. ""He added: ""We are getting body bags instead of a deal. ""Families of the hostages have been pushing for a nationwide strike as part of efforts to get a ceasefire agreement between Mr Netanyahu's government and Hamas for weeks. The Hostages Families Forum said that the six captives, whose bodies were recovered by Israeli military, were ""murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture and starvation in Hamas captivity"". ""The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,"" it said. The prime minister said he was committed to securing a deal that releases the remaining captives and protects the country's security. But he said: ""Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal. ""The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was quick to condemn the general strike, claiming that it represented ""the interests of Hamas"". But others have come forward in support. Tel Aviv's Mayor Ron Huldai announced that the city's municipal workers were free to join Monday's strike ""as a sign of solidarity with the abductees and their families"".   It is not clear how many hostages remain in Gaza. Hamas kidnapped 251 people and killed 1,200 others during an attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel launched a retaliatory military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. More than 40,530 people have been killed there since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Tens of thousands rally in Israel calling for hostage release deal,Tens of thousands rally in Israel calling for hostage release deal,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze5x793569o,articles/article_3267.txt,results/article_3267.txt.json
3268,2024-10-30 00:09:03.771000+00:00,/news/articles/c99rx89znmlo,"The sound of war is loud at night in Beirut’s eastern Achrafieh neighbourhood. Residents can hear Israeli air strikes hitting the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, known as Dahieh. Some can even see the explosions lighting up the sky from their balconies. However, on the streets it is quiet. Volunteers in uniform are patrolling the predominantly Christian neighbourhood holding walkie-talkies to co-ordinate their operation. The neighbourhood watch was formed a few years ago following the financial crisis that hit Lebanon to reassure residents worried about crime. But with recent developments, the mission has changed. ""We have concerns with displaced people who are coming in huge numbers to Beirut, and they have a lot of needs, and it is very complicated,” says Nadim Gemayel, who formed the organisation behind the neighbourhood watch. Communities across Lebanon rallied to help house and feed the hundreds of thousands of families who were displaced when Israel escalated its air campaign against Hezbollah last month before launching a ground invasion of the south. However, an influx of people from the predominantly Shia Muslim areas where the Iran-backed group has a strong presence - Dahieh, south Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley in the east - into places which are majority Sunni Muslim and Christian also risk exacerbating sectarian divisions in a country where memories of the 1975-1990 civil war are still vivid. Recent Israeli attacks on those areas has only served to heighten tensions between residents and the displaced. A strike on 14 October in the northern town of Aitou, which killed 23 displaced people, shook the Christian community. Even though the arrival of wealthy Shia families from the south and Dahieh have caused rental prices to skyrocket and boosted the incomes of landlords, many are now concerned that they could be members of Hezbollah and potential Israeli targets. Some building management firms have sent out forms to residents asking them for identity details, the number of family members who are staying in flats, and vehicles they are using. In some areas, leaflets have been distributed asking for members of Hezbollah to leave, while individuals known to be affiliated with the group have been told to go. ""There is a feeling of fear. Some citizens are suspicious about who is coming to their region. A lot of people are very afraid that some Hezbollah members live in a building where they are followed by Israel and probably targeted,” Gemayel says. “This is why we are trying to follow up what’s happening and trying to control this with the army and security forces to secure the refugees and citizens at the same time. ”Although residents may feel reassured by the neighbourhood watch, some worry that such initiative carries echoes of the civil war, when sectarian militias controlled different areas of Beirut. The civil war, which lasted 15 years and left almost 150,000 people dead, pitted militias linked to Lebanon’s sects against each other. It began as a conflict between Christian and Palestinian militias, which were allied with Muslim militias. Later, there were conflicts among Christian and Muslim militias. Foreign powers were also drawn in, with Syrian troops moving in and Israel invading twice. The main Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, was led by Nadim Gemayel’s father, Bashir, until he was assassinated in Achrafieh in 1982 after being elected the country’s president. All militias were supposed to be disarmed after the 1989 Taif Accord that ended the civil war, but Hezbollah was exempt because it was fighting Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon. When Israeli forces finally withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to give up its weapons and continued to carry out cross-border attacks on Israel. They fought a month-long war in 2006, which left much of the south and Beirut’s southern suburbs in ruins. Gemayel has long called for Hezbollah to give up its weapons. After Israel escalated its air campaign, he said the group was ""reaping what it sowed over the past 20 years"" - but also warned that the Lebanese people would ""pay a heavy price in destruction and devastation"". In the mixed neighbourhood of Hamra in western Beirut, the scene is completely different. Unlike in the predominantly Christian side of Beirut, many schools in Hamra have been turned into shelters for displaced families. Members of the Syrian Socialist National Party, an ally of Hezbollah which has a presence in Hamra, rushed to open empty buildings, including some newly built apartment blocks, to house displaced families. The move caused tensions between some buildings’ owners and displaced families who broke into them. Landlords expressed fears that the new arrivals would eventually refuse to leave the free accommodation. In a six-floor 1960s-style building in the heart of Hamra, a designer who wished to remain anonymous has her studio set on the top floor. She says some families broke into the building and were squatting in the empty flats. ""At beginning, we had 20 people. Now, we have 100 living in the building,” she tells me. ""I have great sympathy for them and don’t want women and children to stay in the street. I won’t ask them to leave until the government finds a solution, but this is not sustainable. ""She is also worried about the potential social impact on the area. The new arrivals are all from the Shia community and follow strict religious rules, with the women wearing the chador, a full-body cloak that covers everything but their faces. ""I don’t have a problem with any religion, but they also should accept my style of living as an atheist,” she says. The mood is indeed changing in Hamra, which is home to multiple cultures and faiths. Thousands of people are believed to have moved there. It is hard to drive or even walk through the neighbourhood because of the number of cars and motorcycles causing traffic jams. The night-life has also changed, with the party- and bar-goers replaced by people queueing for fast food and shisha cafes. Outside shelters, men and women sit on the pavement, smoking shishas and watching news on their mobile phones or even TVs late into the night - something residents have complained about. But increasing numbers of building owners are emptying people from their properties. Fatima al-Haj Yousef, who arrived with her husband and three children from the Bekaa Valley, is worried about where to go next. She has stayed in this building for the past three weeks. ""We are happy to sign documents confirming that when the war is over, we will leave, but they sent the police to force us out,” she says. Fatima is mainly worried about her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter who suffers with cancer and needs medication. “I just need to be somewhere safe and clean for my daughter. The schools are packed full of people, and everyone is smoking indoors. ”Fatima didn’t feel there was any sectarian tension against her as a Shia, but another man who stayed in the building with his five children had a different view. ""If they accept to pay rent, we already can pay rent. But [the landlord] didn’t accept. . . She wants us to go. It’s not only about the building. It’s something else. I think, and this is my opinion, she wants to kill the [Shia] Muslims here. ”This view was echoed by Daniel, a Hezbollah social worker who was helping finding alternative housing for the families. ""They think that resistance is weakened by the death of Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, but we are all Nasrallah,"" he says, referring to the Hezbollah leader killed by Israel in Dahieh last month. He believes that this building is being cleared because the inhabitants are displaced families, who are predominantly Shia and are supporters of what he describes as ""the resistance movement"" - or Hezbollah. Many here believe that Israel won’t stop until Hezbollah is completely disarmed. ""Either all Lebanon will be destroyed by Israel which will be catastrophic, or they [Hezbollah] surrender and give up their arms, and we build a Lebanese state that will be based on the Taif agreement, and everyone has equal rights and obligations,"" says Nadim Gemayel.",Tensions rise in Beirut after influx of displaced people,Tensions rise in Beirut after influx of displaced people,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99rx89znmlo,articles/article_3268.txt,results/article_3268.txt.json

3270,2024-07-30 23:11:03.296000+00:00,/news/articles/c978m6pl99go,"Increasing numbers of bereaved parents in Israel are asking for sperm from the bodies of their sons - many of them soldiers - to be extracted and frozen. Some rules on the procedure have been relaxed in the wake of the 7 October Hamas attacks, but families are angry and frustrated about the lengthy legal processes they face. Avi Harush’s voice trembles as he recalls the moment he learned his 20-year-old son, Reef, had been killed in combat on 6 April 2024 in the Gaza Strip. The military officers who came to his door also presented him with a decision. There was still time to retrieve Reef’s sperm – was the family interested?Avi’s answer was immediate. Reef “lived life to its fullest”, he says. “Despite the horrible loss, we choose to live. ”“Reef loved children and wanted kids of his own - there’s no question about it,” he adds. Reef had no wife or girlfriend. But as Avi began to share his son’s story, several women got in touch, offering to bear Reef’s child. He says the idea is now his “life’s mission”. The family is among a growing number who have frozen sperm since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza in response, in which more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. About 400 Israelis have also been killed in the war. Since 7 October, sperm has been retrieved from nearly 170 young men - both civilians and soldiers - according to the Israeli health ministry. It is roughly 15 times the figure for the same period in previous years. The process involves making an incision in the testicle and removing a small piece of tissue, from which live sperm cells can then be isolated in a lab and frozen. Success rates for retrieving the cells are highest if it is done within 24 hours of death, though they can live for up to 72 hours. In October, the Israeli health ministry waived a requirement for parents to obtain a court order to request the procedure. The IDF says it has become more proactive in offering it to bereaved parents in recent years. But while it has become easier to have sperm frozen, widows or parents who want to use it in the conception of a child have to demonstrate in court that the dead man wanted to have children. The process can take years, particularly for bereaved parents. The first parents in Israel to preserve and use their dead son’s sperm were Rachel and Yaakov Cohen, whose son Keivan was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper, according to the IDF, in 2002 in the Gaza Strip. Their granddaughter, Osher - born from his sperm - is now 10 years old. Rachel describes a moment after Keivan’s death when she felt his presence: “I went to his closet. I wanted to find his smell. I even smelled his shoes,” she says. “He spoke to me from his photo. He asked me to make sure he has children. ”Rachel says they “faced so much opposition”, but eventually secured a ground-breaking legal decision, after which she advertised for a potential mother for her son’s child. Irit - who did not share her surname to protect the family’s privacy - was among dozens of women who responded. She was single. She says she was assessed by a psychologist and a social worker, and then, with court approval, began fertility treatment. “Some say we're playing God. I don't think that's the case,” she says. “There's a difference between a child who knows their father and one conceived by a sperm bank donation,” she adds. Osher knows her father was killed in the army. Her room is decorated with dolphins. She says she knows he loved them. “I know they took his sperm and searched for a perfect mother to bring me to the world,” she adds. Irit says Osher has grandparents, uncles and cousins from both sides. But she says she is raising Osther “normally” to ensure she “is not raised to be a living monument”. Preserving sperm has “great meaning” to bereaved families, says Dr Itai Gat, director of the sperm bank at Shamir Medical Center – who himself performs the surgery. “It’s the last chance to preserve the option of reproduction and fertility in the future,” he says. He says there’s been a “significant cultural shift” recently towards greater acceptance of the process, but that the current rules have created a conflict in the case of single men. Dr Gat says, for them, there is often no clear record of consent. This has left families already coping with grief in “a very difficult situation”, where the sperm has been frozen but they can’t use it for fertilisation. “We’re discussing reproduction, bringing a boy or girl into the world… that we know will be an orphan, without a father,” he says. In the majority of cases, the deceased would not have known the mother of the child made using his sperm, he adds, and all decisions regarding the child, his education and future would be made by the mother. He says he was previously opposed to preserving sperm unless there was clear consent from the deceased, but his view has softened since meeting families bereaved in the current war. “I see how meaningful it is to them, how sometimes it gives them some comfort,” he says. Rabbi Yuval Sherlo, a prominent liberal rabbi who leads the Tzohar Center for Jewish Ethics in Tel Aviv, also says the consent of the deceased is an important consideration. And he explains that two important principles in Jewish law are also involved – continuing a man’s lineage and burying the body whole. Some rabbis say continuing the lineage is so important it merits the damage to the body tissue, he says, while others maintain the procedure should not take place at all. The current rules on the issue are guidelines published by the Attorney General in 2003, but are not enshrined in law. Israeli lawmakers have attempted to draft a bill to create clearer, more comprehensive rules, but efforts have stalled. People close to the process have told the BBC there has been conflict over the level of explicit consent that should be required from the deceased, and whether the child would receive the benefits normally given to the children of soldiers killed in service. Israeli media have also reported disagreement between widows and bereaved parents over how much control parents should have over their sons’ sperm, especially if the widow does not wish to use it to have a child. Those who have already frozen their sons’ sperm are worried that if legislation is eventually agreed, it will only address future issues of consent, and not prevent them from facing lengthy court battles. For Avi, there is determination within his grief. He looks through a cardboard carton, filled with diaries, albums and mementoes of his son. He says he won’t rest until he can give Reef a child: “It will happen… and his children will receive this box. ”",The Israelis who want grandchildren from their dead sons’ sperm,The Israelis who want grandchildren from their dead sons’ sperm,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c978m6pl99go,articles/article_3270.txt,results/article_3270.txt.json
3271,2024-11-27 19:50:47.735000+00:00,/news/articles/c5ygn5579gvo,"Listen to Jeremy read this articleFor most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I’m attending in Rome said she couldn’t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer. “It was like the night before Christmas when you’re a kid. I couldn’t wait for it to happen. ”You can see why there’s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes. Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed. But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel’s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000 civilians evacuated further south. Israel’s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home. In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates a buffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire. Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse. Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen. All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out. But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel’s offensive. Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu’s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu’s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy. The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel’s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah’s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel’s invasion force. But Hezbollah is no longer the same threat to Israel. Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop. Israel’s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns. If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action. In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance ‘to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,’ he continued. Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel’s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel’s Gaza offensive. There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel’s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran’s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies. Just like Hezbollah’s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran’s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah’s assassination did not repair the damage. Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon – but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Hezbollah and Iran’s deterrence strategy matched Israel’s own deterrence for almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel’s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing. Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying. Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah’s tunnel network. A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages. It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu’s political survival, and his government’s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence. The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged. The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon’s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran. The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel – the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza. What is certain though is that the Middle East has no chance of escaping more generations of war and violent death until the region’s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel’s favour. In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.

3272,2024-07-28 00:26:38.147000+00:00,/news/articles/cz475vdd97qo,"As she put in some last practice lengths in Paris last week, Palestinian-American swimmer Valerie Tarazi thought back to her moment of inspiration: watching the legendary Michael Phelps winning eight golds in Beijing in 2008. “That was like my first like, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to be an Olympian’,” she said. Paris is a dream come true, as it is for countless athletes taking to sport’s biggest stage. But after more than nine months of war in Gaza and the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, Tarazi says her participation is also an act of commemoration. “It’s me honouring them,” she said. A child of the huge Palestinian diaspora, Tarazi, who swims in the 200m individual medley next Friday, was born and raised in the US. But she celebrates her connections to one of Gaza’s oldest Christian families. She says four members of her extended family were killed when a church was hit during intense Israeli bombing last December. “It takes a toll on us,” she said of Gaza’s rising death toll, which is now approaching 40,000. “This is our friends, our family, our teammates or national team members,” she said. The International Olympic Committee has recognised the state of Palestine since 1995. Three quarters of UN members also now recognise Palestine, but the US, Britain and the host of this year’s games do not. Despite her punishing training schedule and the sacrifices needed to compete at this level, Tarazi is acutely aware that she is in a uniquely privileged position, offered the chance to carry the flag in the world’s greatest sporting jamboree. “My little bit of pain is absolutely nothing compared to what they have to go through every single day,” she said of her compatriots back home. One of her less fortunate teammates, Tamer Qaoud, is having a hard time keeping his own sporting ambitions alive. His house in Gaza has been destroyed. He and his family have been forced to move twice during the war. They’re now living in a tent in Deir el-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. “My dream was to reach the Olympics,” he told the BBC this week. “Unfortunately, due to the war and circumstances, we couldn’t leave Gaza. ”Qaoud, a 1500 metre runner, has already represented his country twice. A year ago, at the Arab Games in Algiers, he wore running spikes for the first time. It was also the first time he’d ever run on anything other than concrete. In September, he joined Tarazi at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, in China. They were still there when war broke out in Gaza in early October. Qaoud says he had to go home. His best time is well outside the Olympic qualifying mark, but any faint chance he might have had of competing in Paris, even on a wild card, quickly vanished. “I wanted to compete with the world's best athletes, like Jakob,” he said, referring to the current men’s 1500 world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen. “I wanted to run alongside him, to feel what it's like to compete with the world's best. ”Amid the tents, the dust and the date palms of Deir el-Balah, he still trains, wearing his white Palestinian uniform, watched by small groups of bewildered children. His old training ground, Gaza City’s Yarmouk Stadium, is a waste ground of rubbish and displaced Palestinian families, seeking shelter amid the stands. And his coach, Bilal Abu Samaan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last December, one of an estimated 182 athletes and sports officials killed since last October, according to the Palestinian Football Association. Qaoud knows his time has not yet come. Unless he can get out of Gaza, he fears it never will. “The war destroyed everything, shattering our dreams,” he said. “I hope to leave Gaza, join a training camp, regain my old strength and come back stronger than before. ”Back in the pool in Paris, another Palestinian swimmer, Yazan al-Bawwab, said he was proud to be an ambassador for a place where just playing sport is a challenge. “We don’t have a pool in Palestine,” he said. “We don’t have infrastructure. ”Like Tarazi, al-Bawwab was born and raised abroad, but he wears his uniform, and his identity, with fierce pride. “France does not recognise Palestine as a country,” al-Bawwab said defiantly, repeating the sentence for emphasis. “I’m here, raising the flag. ”",The Palestinians heading to Paris to represent their people,The Palestinians heading to Paris to represent their people,"israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz475vdd97qo,articles/article_3272.txt,results/article_3272.txt.json
3274,2024-10-09 23:14:57.773000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2lr0jd37xo,"US President Joe Biden and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have held a much-anticipated 30-minute phone call - believed to be their first contact since August - which included discussions on Israel’s intended retaliation to Iran’s missile strike last week. The White House described the dialogue as ""direct"" and ""productive"", and said Biden and Netanyahu had agreed to stay in ""close contact"" in coming days. Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the call. Speaking shortly afterwards, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said its attack against Iran would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"". Two forces are at work. One is Joe Biden’s reluctance to see the US dragged into a war with Iran that it believes would be unnecessary and dangerous. The other is a strong sense among some in Israel that they have an opportunity to deal a body blow to Iran - their mortal enemy. Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah has energised Israelis who were desperate to break out of the grinding war of attrition on their border with Lebanon. Lebanon, for them, felt like success and progress, a stark contrast to the position in Gaza.  Despite Israel’s onslaught on Gaza that has killed at least 42,000 people, most of them civilians, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been able to deliver his two war aims – the destruction of Hamas and the recovery of the hostages. Hamas is still fighting, and still holds around 100 hostages, many of whom might be dead. The damage done to Israel’s enemies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, has produced in some Israelis an urgent conviction to go further and mount a direct assault on Iran. For them, a devastating air attack on Iran is a seductive prospect. Top of the target list for many Israelis are the heavily fortified sites, some driven deep into mountains where Iran houses nuclear facilities that Israel and others fear could be used to make a bomb. President Biden has made clear the US opposes the idea. The US believes Iran is not about to make a nuclear weapon. An attack could push them to construct one. One of the most prominent voices in Israel pressing Netanyahu to ignore US wishes is former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett who says Israel must not hesitate to act against what he calls the Iranian octopus. He told me that it was ""the 11th hour"". Like the opposition politician and former general Benny Gantz, Bennett believes Iran is weaker than it has been for decades because of the damage done to Hezbollah and Hamas. “Essentially Iran was defending itself with two arms, Hezbollah and Hamas. They were sort of its insurance policy against a strike,"" Bennett says. ""But now both of those arms are pretty much neutralised. ”Bennett sees the moment as a once in a generation opportunity to do real damage to Iran’s Islamic Regime. He adds: “Here's the thing. The strategy with Iran - ultimately it's not going to happen tomorrow. ""We need to accelerate the demise of this regime. This is a regime that will fall. “If Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, the likelihood that they'll use it in order to save the regime is high. And that means that they’re going to turn the whole Middle East into a nuclear nightmare. ” Middle East conflict: How will it end? Bennett recalled two Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities he believes made the Middle East much safer - in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. “People don't like it,"" Bennett says. ""But we saved the world from [Bashar al-] Assad with nuclear weapons. ""We have the thankless job of taking out the nuclear facilities of the worst regimes in the world. Everyone likes to criticise us, but we're doing that job. ""And if they get that bomb, it's everyone's problem. It's not our problem. I want to see how Londoners will feel when there's an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear bomb. We cannot allow that to happen. ” Iran and Israel have been in direct conflict since April, after Israel assassinated leading Iranian generals with a big airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Syria. Iran’s retaliation was a missile strike on Israel. The escalation has continued. The latest came on Tuesday last week in response to Israel’s assault on Iran's ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah. Iran unleashed a huge ballistic missile attack, and Israel’s prime minister vowed to hit back. President Biden was reluctant to restrain Israel in Gaza. And has ""urged"" Israel to minimise harm to civilians in Lebanon. But he has been adamant that Israel must not answer the Iranians with a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The US believes Iran is not about to make a nuclear weapon. President Biden has said Israel must defend itself – but not by attacking Iranian nuclear sites – or its oil industry.  The US fears getting dragged into a war it doesn’t want. And there are concerns that if Iran can ride out an attack it will go for broke to produce a nuclear warhead for its missiles. The next phases in this spiralling war depend on the extent of Israel’s retaliation – which may come any day now.",The two forces at work on Biden-Netanyahu phone call,The two forces at work on Biden-Netanyahu phone call,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2lr0jd37xo,articles/article_3274.txt,results/article_3274.txt.json
3275,2024-10-04 21:47:10.828000+00:00,/news/articles/c0r89qwwx2lo,"There have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst. In the past seven days, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. Western and regional powers - led by the US - have pushed for de-escalation. The UN Security Council called for an ""immediate end"" to hostilities and the G7, which includes the US, UK and Germany, has called for “restraint”. But so far those efforts have failed - and the Middle East stands closer than ever to all-out war. Here’s how the last week played out. As the sun set over Beirut on 27 September, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. Several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. Plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the Lebanese capital. The strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Seen as a prize-target, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by Israel. His death capped a week of ramped-up Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. The week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. Nasrallah’s death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. A US proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York. Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon had even said his side was “open to ideas”. But hours after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on an early flight home from the UN - and any lingering hopes of diplomacy prevailing faded away.  Three days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon, marking the start of a ground invasion. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its operations would be “limited and targeted”. Fighting so far has driven nearly 1.2 million people from their homes, according to Lebanon’s crisis unit. At least 8 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Israel says the operation is aimed at stopping Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border – something it has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the current Gaza war. Now Israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: Gaza and Lebanon. That hasn’t happened in decades. The last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with UN Resolution 1701, which stipulated Hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon. That never happened, and with Iranian support, Hezbollah grew in strength. Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon’s political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a “limited and targeted” operation, it’s clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size. Spurred by an astonishing two and a half weeks, Israel is in an ambitious frame of mind. The next day, at around 19:30 local time, 10 million Israelis were sent running for bomb shelters across the country after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The nation's air defence system sprang into action - and allies including the US and UK were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. With its biggest proxy group in disarray, Tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on Israel in April. Hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. But while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal Iran’s desire for an all-out fight. That’s hardly surprising. If it came to a full-on war, Iran knows that it would lose, and badly. It could even herald the end of the Islamic Republic. Israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of Middle Eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down Iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. Iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. Nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at Friday prayers in Tehran, but Iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further. Despite Hezbollah’s devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in Lebanon. And history shows us it is easy for Israel to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. As for Israel’s response to Iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since Tuesday. US president Joe Biden said he has discouraged Israel from striking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation. A severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in Iran. But Israel’s immediate objectives are closer to home. “Total victory” in Gaza and removing the threat posed by Hezbollah along the northern border. Israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. Benjamin Netanyahu says there are seven: Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Yemen, Iran, Iraq and Syria. It’s true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria have so far posed little real threat. We’re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in Gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion.",The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war,The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r89qwwx2lo,articles/article_3275.txt,results/article_3275.txt.json
3276,2024-07-28 14:38:42.181000+00:00,/news/articles/cz5rj16ed4lo,"Thousands of people gathered on Sunday for the funerals of children and young people killed in a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, as world leaders scrambled to contain the attack’s political fallout. Members of the Druze community wept as they carried caskets through Majdal Shams, while some yelled in anger at government ministers there, Israeli media said. The White House, meanwhile, said Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah carried out the attack, which killed 12. Israel has also accused it. Hezbollah denies it was responsible. On Sunday, global leaders condemned the attack and moved to de-escalate tensions amid fears it could spark a war between Israel and Hezbollah. In response to Saturday’s strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory overnight, and Hezbollah struck two Israeli military bases on Sunday. Cross-border fire between the two sides has escalated since Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli sites a day after Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October. The Hamas attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of the Palestinians. Saturday’s attack was the deadliest loss of life in and around Israel's northern border since October. The strike hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams, one of four towns in the Golan Heights where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. Israel’s foreign ministry said 10 of the 12 victims were between the ages of 10 and 16, and has not released the ages of the other two victims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Hezbollah would ""pay a heavy price"", arrived in Israel on Sunday after cutting short his trip to the US. He planned to hold a meeting with his military chiefs to assess the situation and approve operational plans. Hezbollah denied it had anything to do with the strike, but had earlier on Saturday claimed responsibility for four other attacks, including one on a military base around 3km (2 miles) away. At a funeral in Majdal Shams on Sunday, weeping men wearing traditional red-topped white hats carried 10 of the white-covered caskets through packed streets, AFP reported. Women dressed in black abaya robes cried as they laid flowers on the caskets. Some mourners carried large photos of the dead children. Fadi Mahmud, 48, told AFP that it was the first time Majdal Shams had experienced such a loss during the war. ""Our community is very close-knit. These children are like children of everybody in the village,"" he was reported as saying. Anger among the community also boiled over at the funeral, with some directing their rage at Israeli government officials who attended, the Times of Israel reported. “Now you come here? Ten months you didn’t come!” a man wearing a military uniform was reported as shouting at Housing Minister Nir Barkat and Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. His comments were met with applause. “We’re tired of your promises!” another person reportedly yelled at Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. In a video posted on social media, hecklers surrounded Mr Smotrich, cursing and saying “we don’t want him!”, according to a Times of Israel translation. Israeli media reported that a leader of the Druze community had asked in a letter that government ministers not attend the funeral to avoid turning the tragedy into a “political event”. The Druze are part of an Arabic-speaking ethnic group based in Lebanon, Syria, the Golan Heights and northern Israel. In Israel, they have full citizenship rights and comprise about 1.5% of the population. But most of those in the Golan have retained an allegiance to Syria. They can still study and work in Israel, though only those with citizenship can vote and serve in the army. The vast majority of the international community does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1981. On Sunday, global leaders spoke out against the strike and cautioned against escalation, although they differed on who was responsible. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a post on X that the UK “condemns the strike in Golan Heights that has tragically claimed at least 12 lives” and Hezbollah “must cease their attacks”. “We are deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation and destabilisation,” Secretary Lammy said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington backed Israel's right to defend itself, while adding that ""we also don't want to see the conflict escalate"". Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the BBC that he did not think Hezbollah carried out the attack, but added “it could be a mistake by the Israelis or by Hezbollah – I don’t know”. The Lebanese government condemned the violence and called in a statement for a ceasefire on all fronts.",Thousands mourn children killed in Golan Heights strike ,Thousands mourn children killed in Golan Heights strike ,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz5rj16ed4lo,articles/article_3276.txt,results/article_3276.txt.json

Israeli troops re-entered the city last week after officials said that Hamas was attempting ""to reassemble its forces there"". Some 150,000 Palestinians were forced to flee their homes ahead of the operation, two UN agencies said. On Tuesday, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) officials said more than 150 gunmen had been killed during the week long offensive. But the Hamas-run Gaza media office said at least 250 Palestinians were killed and more than 300 injured during the fighting. Thirty more remain missing, they said. On Tuesday, aid workers could be seen in the streets of Khan Younis collecting dead bodies and wrapping them in rugs, before transporting them to morgues around the city, the Reuters news agency reported. Thousands of Palestinians - many carrying their possessions - streamed back into the city as Israeli forces withdrew, with many reporting extensive damage to their homes. Most arrived on foot. Witnesses told Reuters that the IDF had bulldozed the main cemetery in Bani Suhaila, the town on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis. Nearby homes and roads had also been damaged, they said. According to the Hamas-run media office, around 300 houses were hit by Israeli munitions during the raid - 30 of which they said were inhabited at the time. Some residents returning said they had been displaced from their homes a number of times before. ""I am coming back and I have faith in God. I don't know whether we will live or die, but it is all for the sake of the homeland,"" said Etimad Al-Masri. She had been forced to walk 5km (3 miles) in the intense heat. Israeli forces had previously withdrawn from Khan Younis in April after months of intense fighting, with commanders saying their objectives in the area had been completed. Thousands of Palestinians subsequently returned, especially as IDF operations began in Rafah in early May. But IDF troops have spent the past several weeks launching renewed assaults on areas it had previously left, saying it is seeking to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Elsewhere, Israel has ordered thousands of people to leave their homes in the central al-Bureij area. It comes as strikes have begun ahead of a possible new operation in the area. Since the conflict began in October more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Tens of thousands walked from Russell Square to Whitehall, where speeches took place outside Downing Street. The event was organised by groups including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, with people travelling from around the country to take part. Seventeen people were arrested, the Metropolitan Police said.  The largely peaceful protest comes one year after the 7 October attacks in Israel. The Metropolitan Police said it was hard to accurately estimate turnout but the protest ""appears to be greater than other recent protests"". The crowd stretched from Downing Street to Trafalgar Square while speakers, including ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, were addressing demonstrators. People could be seen carrying Palestinian flags and placards with messages such as ""ceasefire now"" and ""hands off Lebanon"", and chanting ""stop the bombing now"".  A counter-protest also took place, with police forming a cordon between the two marches. But a small group broke away from the pro-Palestinian protest and were stopped trying to approach the counter-protest at Aldwych. Three people were arrested after officers intervened. Conditions were imposed to move the counter-protest group back to Trafalgar Square as it got ""too close to the main march and well away from the agreed area"", police said. Of the 17 arrests, police said three people had been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, three for assault, eight for public order offences (four racially aggravated), one for a breach of Public Order Act conditions and two for supporting a proscribed organisation. The force said one of those arrested for supporting a proscribed organisation was seen wearing what appeared to be a parachute. It added it was aware of social media posts showing people holding placards with messages of support for Hezbollah - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK government and others - and it was working to find those involved.  Separately, pro-Palestinian supporters walked through the centre of Edinburgh during a silent march on Saturday afternoon. Organisers called for a ceasefire and for the UK and Scottish governments to impose sanctions on Israel. On Sunday, a memorial event will take place in Hyde Park organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed at least 41,825 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The IDF said they were hiding in an underground compound in northern Gaza and were killed by air strikes.

In a statement, the IDF said Rawhi Mushtaha was ""one of Hamas's most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas's force deployment"".

Separately, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in the Iranian capital, Tehran, in July. Iran blamed the incident on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim it.

In the first joint UK-France visit in more than 10 years, the pair met Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer, as well as visiting the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It comes as a fresh round of ceasefire talks have begun in Doha, with negotiators from the US, Qatar and Egypt meeting an Israeli delegation. There are fears of an all-out regional war involving Iran following the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Western countries have been urging Iran to refrain from retaliating against Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the assassination. The Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is also threatening to retaliate over Israel’s killing of one of its top commanders in an air strike in Beirut. It is hoped that a new ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages would calm tensions in the region. Speaking to reporters, Mr Lammy said Israeli ministers had told him ""they hope we are on the cusp of a deal"". He added: ""The time for a deal for those hostages to be returned, for aid to get in in the quantities that are necessary in Gaza, and for the fighting to stop, is now. ""The US said there had been a ""promising start"" to talks but ""there remains a lot of work to do"". Hamas has said it will not participate in the negotiations for now, although mediators are said to be relaying messages to the armed group’s officials based there. The group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - has claimed Israel has added new conditions to a previous proposal that had US and international support. Earlier Mr Lammy warned of a ""dangerous moment for the Middle East"". ""The risk of the situation spiralling out of control is rising. Any Iranian attack would have devastating consequences for the region,"" he said. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné said: ""It's never too late for peace. ""We must at all costs avoid a regional war, which would have terrible consequences. We must secure a ceasefire agreement and the release of the all the hostages. "" Mr Lammy also responded to events in the occupied West Bank overnight, where a Palestinian man was shot dead as dozens of Israeli settlers attacked a village. ""The scenes overnight of the burning and torching of buildings, of the Molotov cocktails thrown at cars, of the widespread rampage and chasing of people from their homes is abhorrent and I condemn it in the strongest of terms,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he took the riots ""seriously"" and promised those responsible for any criminal acts would be ""caught and prosecuted"". Mr Lammy said he hoped the swift investigation promised by Mr Netanyahu would ensure those responsible would be brought to justice. It is the latest in the series of attacks by extremist settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where there has been a spike in violence since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday that at least 40,005 people had been killed in the territory since then. The figure, which does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, is often disputed by the Israeli government but is broadly accepted by UN agencies.","Time for Gaza ceasefire deal is now, says Lammy","Time for Gaza ceasefire deal is now, says Lammy",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0jpzqxzwp0o,articles/article_3281.txt,results/article_3281.txt.json
3282,2024-12-03 13:09:51.658000+00:00,/news/articles/c62757dd55no,"US President-elect Donald Trump has issued an apparent warning to Hamas, threatening ""all hell to pay"" if hostages held in Gaza are not released by the time he returns to the White House on 20 January. Dozens of people taken during the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack remain unaccounted for. On Monday, the Israeli military said an Israeli-American soldier who it believed to be a captive had in fact been killed last October. Without mentioning Hamas by name, Trump posted online the same day: ""Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied history of the United States of America. ""Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for his ""strong statement"". Trump has generally spoken of ending foreign conflicts, and of reducing US involvement. He has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel during its campaign in Gaza, but has urged the American ally to end its military operation. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel in 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Tens of thousands of others have been injured and much of the Palestinian enclave is in ruins. On Monday, Israel attributed a new death to the 2023 assault by Hamas - saying Israeli-American soldier Omer Neutra was killed that day, and his body taken to Gaza. He was previously believed to have been in captivity but alive. US President Joe Biden was among those who paid tribute to the 21-year-old, saying he was ""devastated and outraged"" at Neutra's death. In recent days, Hamas also released a video purporting to show another Israeli-American caught up in the attacks, hostage Edan Alexander. In the clip, in which he appears distressed, the man calls on Trump and Netanyahu to negotiate for his freedom. No guarantees Trump will give Netanyahu all he wantsWhat Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and ChinaSeven things Trump says he will do as presidentWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? Monday's Truth Social post by Trump gave few specifics, but appeared to refer to the hostages still held captive in Gaza by Hamas. “Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire world, in the Middle East - but it’s all talk, and no action!"" he wrote. He went on to say: ""If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity. "" The 20 January date refers to Trump's inauguration, following his win in last month's US presidential election. His post continued: ""Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!""In response, senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters that Netanyahu had sabotaged all efforts to secure a deal that involved exchanging the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. ""Therefore, we understand [Trump's] message is directed first at Netanyahu and his government to end this evil game,"" he told the news agency. Netanyahu said Trump's message was aimed at the ""responsibility of Hamas"" to release the hostages, and said the president-elect's comment ""adds another force to our continued effort to release all the hostages"". His words echoed comments made during July's Republican National Convention, when he threatened a ""very big price"" if hostages were not returned. During the recent election campaign, Trump presented himself as the anti-war candidate, suggesting for example that he could end the conflict in Ukraine ""in a day"". A ceasefire in a linked conflict in Lebanon - between Israel and Hezbollah, a group allied to Hamas - came into effect last week, but has been threatened by fire from both sides. After the Lebanon ceasefire was agreed, the US said it would make another push with regional powers for a ceasefire in Gaza, involving the release of hostages and the removal of Hamas from power.

3283,2024-11-01 22:43:16.050000+00:00,/news/articles/cy5ln171edlo,"On a crisp, sunny day in the largest Arab-majority city in the US, dozens of people gathered outside the Great Commoner cafe to catch a glimpse of Donald Trump. “What we want is peace,” Trump told a group of Arab-American business leaders inside the Dearborn, Michigan, restaurant - days before the presidential election. But a crowd of pro- and anti-Trump voters shouting at one another nearby demonstrated how divided the Michigan community has become over choosing the best American president to handle the escalating Middle East war. The Republican’s Friday visit to Dearborn, once a reliably Democratic area, marks the culmination of his efforts to court the 200,000-plus Arab-Americans who live in must-win Michigan. It could sway a tied race between Trump and Kamala Harris. Hillary Clinton lost Michigan to Trump by only 10,000 votes in 2016, while Biden won it back by 150,000 votes in 2020. Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?How Israelis and Palestinians see the US election On billboards lining Michigan highways and during visits, the Trump campaign argues that he stands “for peace” in the Middle East, while casting Harris as pro-Israel. That message has worked on some. Trump secured two endorsements from the mayors of Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck, a small Muslim majority city near Detroit, while Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said Friday he declined a meeting with the former president. The trend worries Abbas Alawieh, one of the leaders of the Uncommitted movement - a group protesting US support of Israel - who pledged to back Harris even though his group refused to endorse her. “I’ve been hearing … a lot more of the feeling that this is a binary choice, and some voters feeling like maybe we should just vote for Donald Trump because he’s saying he’s a pro-peace candidate,” Mr Alawieh told the BBC at Haraz Cafe in Dearborn on Friday. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, said the vice-president has been and is supportive of the “diverse Muslim community” in the US. ""The Vice President is committed to work to earn every vote, unite our country, and to be a President for all Americans,” said Nasrina Bargzie, campaign director of Muslim and Arab American Outreach. She added that Harris would ensure the community can “live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration”. Despite frustrations with the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the war, several community leaders told the BBC they don’t believe Trump offers a solution either. “We’re not naive about what he means for our community,” said Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network, a Michigan Muslim advocacy group. He cited Trump’s “Muslim ban”, his 2017 executive order to ban travelers from predominately Muslim nations. Still, Mr Nazarko and other leaders said sending a message about their anger over the Biden-Harris administration’s pro-Israel policies is more important than who wins the White House. They have encouraged votes for third-party candidates rather than sitting out the election. That’s the message Hassan Abdel Salam, a leader of the Abandon Harris campaign and former Democrat, delivered to a packed room gathered for prayer at the American Muslim Center in Dearborn on Friday.  ""Our intention is to show that we are punishing someone, a leader who for a year we protested and we gave ultimata, warnings,"" he said. ""Our belief now, even despite having lived under Trump, a truly vile person, has been that we now see that there is no lesser evil. "" Muslim leaders and political experts acknowledge that the Harris campaign has decided to focus more on securing moderate voters and improving turnout in traditionally Democratic areas like Detroit, rather than courting Muslims and Arab-Americans. The campaign also is concerned about losing support from pro-Israel Jewish voters and other Democrats more likely to cast a ballot, said Saeed Khan, a Wayne State University professor. Mr Khan said many voters who considered casting a ballot for third-party candidates, likely will end up voting for Harris to keep Trump out of office. It’s a calculation Wael Alzayat, CEO of Muslim voter outreach group Emgage, hopes Michigan voters, in general, will make. “A vote for third-party is a vote for Trump, which will bring about the worst outcome,” he said. “Trump is a brick wall. ”Mohammed Hassan, a member of Hamtramck's fully Muslim city council, said he believed the majority of his 25,000-strong Bangladeshi Muslim community is voting for Harris and the rest for Trump. But, he said, all Muslims don't necessarily agree. “Yemeni Muslims in the same city may go 50-50 between Trump and Harris,” he said. Still, several imams who have endorsed Trump are of Yemeni descent, as well as Hamtramck's Yemeni Mayor Amer Ghalib. No prominent election polling has been conducted among Michigan's Bangladeshi and Yemeni communities. Many Arab Americans and Muslims crave a more “balanced narrative” about the war, including more empathy for the suffering of Gazans and Lebanese, Mr Khan said. “For Harris to talk about 100 some-odd [Israeli] hostages, and not mention 45,000 to 50,000 Gazans killed, to not consider that there was an impact on American citizens, families and lives, that I think was seen as egregious,"" he said. Over 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas after the group's October 2023 attack, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage in the attack. None of this makes the decision to support Harris easy, said Mr Alawieh, the Uncommitted leader. Her campaign made a mistake by not budging on Israel, which also may cost her support from Democratic young voters or voters of colour, he said. “It feels to me like the Harris campaign here in Michigan left a lot of votes on the table,” Mr Alawieh said. “I hope they’re doing that as part of some calculation that she wins. I hope that after this election, we don’t look back at her campaign and say ‘Maybe we shouldn’t have left those votes on the table. ’” PATH TO 270: The states they need to win - and whyWhere Kamala Harris stands on 10 issuesWhere Donald Trump stands on 10 issues",Trump courts divided Arab-American voters in must-win Michigan,Trump courts divided Arab-American voters in must-win Michigan,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy5ln171edlo,articles/article_3283.txt,results/article_3283.txt.json
3284,2024-11-14 11:58:54.275000+00:00,/news/articles/c0endd8qj01o,"For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest. Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: “I won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president. ”But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration’s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory – decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians. “No-one has done more,” he told an Israeli radio station. “President Trump and I fully expect that will continue. ”What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect’s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements. The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to “a consistent and loyal friend"", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote ""Mike Huckabee"" with heart emojis.  Follow live updates on this storyWho has Trump appointed to his top team so far?What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0Trump picking Gaetz to head justice department stuns - but sends strong messageWhy is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar? Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee’s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis’ ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state. Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: “There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighbourhoods, they’re cities. “There’s no such thing as an occupation. ”The following year, he said: “I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration. The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee’s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term. On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be ""the year of sovereignty"" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory. That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement. “You can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,"" he says. ""So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order. ” Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington. “Four years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around. ”Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East. As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump’s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September. It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump’s dealings with Israel. In July, he argued that Trump’s “leadership was good for Israel and the entire region”. “With President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran’s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,” he said. Netanyahu’s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump’s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments. US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu’s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza. He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump’s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians. Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden’s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump’s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote. “Mr Huckabee has said things that are absolutely contradictory to international law,” says Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based Palestinian politician. “It will be really bad news for the cause of peace in this region. ”",Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy,Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0endd8qj01o,articles/article_3284.txt,results/article_3284.txt.json
3285,2024-08-20 13:55:30.531000+00:00,/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo,"At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says. A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood. The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians. Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area. The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed. Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike. The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building. ""We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion,"" witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency. ""The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble. ""Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people. He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel. ""Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence,"" it added. The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied. Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the ""increasing frequency"" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them ""with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities"". The warning after at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City, according to the director of a local hospital. The IDF said the school had ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 ""terrorists"" who were killed. The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities. Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah. The IDF said its troops and aircraft had ""eliminated numerous terrorists"" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device. It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation. After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties. But Hamas accused the US of ""acquiescing"" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's ""new conditions"". The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement. A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected. He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war.","Twelve killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school, civil defence says","Twelve killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school, civil defence says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo,articles/article_3285.txt,results/article_3285.txt.json

The university took legal action against ""persons unknown"" over the ""unauthorised occupational encampment"" on its main site on Gower Street in central London, claiming activists were trespassing on private land. The High Court granted a summary possession order, which decided the case in the university's favour without a full trial. In a social media post in response to the court’s decision, protest group UCL Stand for Justice said it was ""disheartening"" that the university had chosen to ""smear"" its actions rather than address its concerns ""through open and honest dialogue"". Protesters have alleged some universities are ""complicit"" in the loss of life in Palestine and want them to divest from Israel in response to its military operation in the Gaza Strip. UCL told the High Court that it had spent more than £200,000 on security fees for managing the unauthorised protest camp. The university also argued that the encampment affected its ability to deliver core educational functions. Katharine Holland KC, for UCL, said in written arguments that the aim was to ""protect the claimant's right to possession of its own land and enable it to carry on the activities of the university and prevent disruption to other members of the university's community”. The protest began on 2 May with 12 tents, growing to an encampment that ""at its peak"" involved about 50 people and some 52 tents, Ms Holland said. The university had identified ""escalating incidents and disruption"" allegedly associated with the encampment, with there being ""obvious concern"" about its ability to use its main quad for events such as its student ""welcome week"" in September, the court was told. UCL sought ""an immediate order for possession"" covering its main campus stretching from Gower Street to Gordon Street and Gordon Square and from Gower Place to Torrington Place. Judge Francesca Kaye said the university's decision-making process was ""appropriate"" and that an order covering its whole campus was ""compatible"" with protesters' human rights, and UCL has a right to regain possession of its land. UCL Stand for Justice said on Instagram that it remained ""open to negotiating in a manner that respects the rights and voices of all students"" and urged the university to ""commit to engaging with us in good faith"". A UCL spokesperson said: “We have a long and proud tradition of upholding the right to freedom of speech and protest, but we must now gain full access to our campus to ensure activities that are so important to the life of the university can go ahead. ""In particular, we are looking forward welcoming our new students to UCL in a way that equips them to make the very best of their time here. ” Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

3288,2024-09-03 10:28:30.082000+00:00,/news/articles/cm2np2l5mlko,"The UK has defended its decision to suspend some arms sales to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the decision ""shameful"", saying on social media that it ""will only embolden Hamas"". But Husam Zomlot, the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, called the partial ban an “important first step” to the UK’s fulfilment of its “legal obligations under domestic and international law”. On Monday, the UK suspended around 30 out of 350 weapons export licences to Israel.  But Defence Secretary John Healey insisted the UK remained a ""staunch ally"" of Israel, telling the BBC Israel's security would not be weakened by the decision. Government ministers say the weapons could be used in Gaza to violate international law. Human rights group Amnesty International UK said the measures were ""too limited"". Others have criticised the timing of the announcement for coming on the same day funerals took place for six hostages killed by Hamas last week. Mr Healey told BBC Breakfast it was ""agonising"" seeing the faces of the dead hostages, but said the timing was ""driven by the fact that this was a legal process"" and the need to report to Parliament. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Healey said these were chosen because they supplement equipment used in Gaza for “offensive purposes”, while the “vast majority of other parts our country exports to Israel are either not related to the conflict or maybe used for Israel’s defence"". UK arms sales to Israel are small in comparison to other allies, contributing just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The UK exports arms to multiple countries including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The US is by far the largest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In a statement, Mr Zomlot said that the Palestinian Mission to the UK would ""continue working"" with the UK government towards a ""full arms embargo"". Amnesty International UK accused the government of ""gesture politics"", given less than 10% of arms export licences were suspended. The charity's chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, said the restrictions were ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". “[The] decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. On social media, Mr Netanyahu said: ""With or without British arms, Israel will win this war and secure our common future. ""Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain’s misguided decision will only embolden Hamas. ""Asked about comments made by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who accused the government of ""abandoning Israel"", Mr Healey insisted the UK would support Israel in defending itself if it came under direct attack. Criticism has also come from within the Labour Party. Former shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the timing was “unfortunate”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World Tonight programme on Monday, she said: “I suspect that what was wanted was once they got the legal advice, they wanted to come in and tell Parliament about it straight away, but I think that it was unfortunate given all the funerals. ""Ms Thornberry also said she expected a “detailed summary"" of the legal advice the government had received over arms, amid questions over the continued supply of parts for F35 jets. Mr Healey said components for F35s were “deliberately” not included in the suspension as they are used by 20 countries and it would be  ""hard to distinguish"" which components would go into Israeli jets. Zarah Sultana, who is currently sitting as an independent MP after being suspended from the Labour Party, has called for an end to all arms sales to Israel. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, the MP for Coventry South described the F35 jets as “the most lethal in the world”. Former national arms advisor Lord Peter Ricketts told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the government’s decision was ""long overdue"". Lord Ricketts told the BBC in April following an Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers that the UK should stop selling arms to Israel, claiming there was “abundant evidence” that obligations on civilian safety were not being fulfilled. In his latest interview with the BBC, he said: “There comes a point when the legal advice is so clear the government has an obligation to follow it. ""The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the move was ""welcome but inadequate"", and said it would continue to push for the government to ""apply the principles of international law"" to all export licenses. Israel has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October during which about 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",UK defends partial Israel arm sales ban,UK defends partial Israel arm sales ban,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2np2l5mlko,articles/article_3288.txt,results/article_3288.txt.json

In May, the chief prosecutor of the ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The previous Conservative UK government had indicated it planned to make a submission to the court - having questioned the right of the prosecutor to apply for a warrant - but had not done so before the election. Now, a spokesperson for the new Labour government has said it will not be making a submission, saying it is ""a matter for the court"". A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I think you would note that the courts have already received a number of submissions on either side, so they are well seized of the arguments to make their independent determinations. ""In addition to Benjamin Netanyahu, the ICC's chief prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Should the ICC proceed with the arrest warrants, the possibility could arise that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant would be asked not to set foot on British soil, to avoid being arrested by the UK authorities. The court has already authorised 70 similar submissions from other countries on the subject and is currently working through them. Prof Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, predicts it will take until the autumn for the court to look at all the submissions and give the prosecutor time to respond if necessary. Asked if the UK's decision would make any difference, he said: “Of course, the fact that a major country such as the UK has decided in the end not to submit is something that the judges will take note of. “But the court still has to undertake the legal analysis regarding the questions that the previous [UK] government wanted to raise. ”He says the decision gives an indication of how the UK would react if the ICC were to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant. “It would be difficult for the UK government, after deferring to the court… to simply shirk off and say I’m not going to implement it. ”A key issue at stake is whether the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over Israeli nationals, in circumstances where the Palestinian Authority can not exercise criminal jurisdiction over Israeli nationals under the terms of the Oslo Accords - a peace agreement in 1993. In 2021, one of three ICC judges ruled the court could not exercise jurisdiction over Israelis, while two others ruled that this could be decided at a later stage. Ahead of the UK's announcement, media outlets in Israel quoted a senior official as saying such a UK decision not to make a submission would be ""fundamentally wrong"", adding that it “distorts justice and truth, and violates the right of all democracies to fight terrorism"". Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive, welcomed the UK's decision, calling the previous government's plan ""totally misguided"". ""Instead of trying to thwart the ICC's much-needed Palestine investigation, the UK should be backing efforts to bring all perpetrators of war crimes and possible genocide to justice. ""The war in Gaza has proved to be politically tricky for Labour, with its stance upsetting many of its traditional supporters, particularly in the Muslim community. In the recent general election, shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth lost his Leicester South seat to a strongly pro-Gaza candidate, while other senior party figures including Wes Streeting and Jess Phillips saw their majorities slashed. Last week the government announced it was restoring funding to Unrwa, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees. The UK had previously halted donations after Israel alleged 12 Unrwa staff were involved in the October 2023 attacks by Hamas. An internal UN investigation into allegations related to that attack is ongoing. But a separate UN review, published in April, found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of terror groups.",UK drops planned Israel arrest warrant challenge,UK drops planned Israel arrest warrant challenge,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckkg525l93lo,articles/article_3290.txt,results/article_3290.txt.json
3291,2024-10-01 20:14:57.789000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2krlgekpxo,"UK forces were involved in supporting Israel after Iran launched ballistic missiles on the country, the defence secretary has said. John Healey, who was in Cyprus to visit military personnel, said British forces had ""played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation” on Tuesday, later adding that RAF jets were ready to engage with Iranian targets but “didn’t need to do so”. The BBC understands British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian ballistic missiles nor did the Royal Navy Destroyer, HMS Duncan, fire any of her Sea Viper missiles. In April RAF Typhoon jets based in Cyprus shot down Iranian drones but they are not equipped to track and shoot down ballistic missiles. Healey said RAF Typhoons were in the air when Iran began its attack on Tuesday night, saying it was ""part of the wider effort to prevent further escalation and to show the UK steadfast support for Israel's right to self defence and to security. ""When asked why the Typhoons did not engage with targets, he said it was because the nature of the attack was different compared with April and that Israel's own defence dealt with the ""massive attack"". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK ""stands with Israel"" and recognises its right to self-defence. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had launched the missiles in retaliation for recent attacks that killed the leaders of the Hezbollah and Hamas militant groups, as well as a senior Iranian commander. Israel said most of the 180 missiles fired were intercepted. Mark Savill, military sciences director at the UK defence think tank RUSI, said RAF Typhoon jets are ""not well-equipped to shoot down ballistic missiles"". ""It’s possible the UK instead provided intelligence, surveillance or other tracking data,"" he said. Healey thanked British personnel involved for their courage and professionalism. ""The UK stands fully behind Israel's right to defend its country and its people against threats. ""Healey is meeting some of the British personnel who are in Cyprus preparing for the possibility of evacuating British nationals from Lebanon. Britons in Lebanon have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website and a UK-chartered plane left Beirut on Wednesday. The defence secretary said: ""We've been booking extra seats on commercial flights that are still leaving Beirut airport, and today, we've also booked the first special chartered commercial flight out, so those who are wanting to leave and ready to leave and responding to our government urging to leave, can do so and continue to do so. ""But some told the BBC they had received no confirmation or details about their booking on the government-chartered flight, despite paying for a seat. British citizen Libby, 25, was about to board a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as ""terrifying"". ""You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,"" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In April British jets shot down a number of drones fired at Israel from Iran. The drones were intercepted in Syrian and Iraqi airspace, where the RAF was already operating as part of the Operation Shader mission against the Islamic State group. The decision to use jets in April was taken by the previous Conservative government and supported at the time and since by Sir Keir. Sir Keir used the address from Downing Street to condemn Iran's attack on Israel, saying he was ""deeply concerned that the region is on the brink"". ""We stand with Israel and we recognise her right to self-defence in the face of this aggression,"" he said. Calling on Iran to stop its attacks, he added: ""Together with its proxies like Hezbollah, Iran has menaced the Middle East for far too long, chaos and destruction brought not just to Israel, but to the people they live amongst in Lebanon and beyond. ""Make no mistake, Britain stands full square against such violence. We support Israel's reasonable demand for the security of its people. ""Sir Keir was on the phone to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu when the Iranian attacks began. The two men had been speaking for around 15 minutes – about the prospect of missiles being fired by Tehran – when Netanyahu had to abandon the call because he had been told the attacks were under way. During their call, Sir Keir also underlined the importance of a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza.

He added: ""If you have the means to leave, the time is now. Do not wait. ""As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. The missile attack came hours after Israel launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon, in what it has described as ""limited, localised and targeted"" raids against  Hezbollah. Lebanese officials say more than 1,000 people have been killed following Israeli air strikes over the past two weeks. Hezbollah has responded by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians.

Preparations are being made in response to a Foreign Office warning that the situation in the Middle East could rapidly deteriorate. On Saturday, the Foreign Office repeated a call for UK nationals to leave Lebanon – while confirming that preparations were underway to help with an evacuation of the country if necessary. An estimated 16,000 British people are currently in Lebanon, Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the House of Commons last week. Hundreds of troops have been sent to Cyprus, where the UK already has a military presence. Meanwhile, in the UK, hundreds more troops have been put on notice - meaning they are ready to be deployed to the region if necessary. The UK already has a significant military presence in Cyprus. An RAF base at Akrotiri is likely to be a hub for any air movements, with RAF Typhoon fighter jets already stationed there. Those jets were involved in defence against an Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel in April. The statement released by the Foreign Office at the weekend said military personnel were in the process of deploying to provide operational support to UK embassies in the region. It did not mention the number of troops involved. A Royal Navy destroyer – HMS Duncan – and a landing ship – RFA Cardigan Bay – are already in the Eastern Mediterranean. RAF helicopters have also been placed on standby. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in the attack, triggering a massive Israeli military response in Gaza. At least 39,480 Palestinians have been killed since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Hostilities between Israel and its neighbours have escalated following the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last Wednesday - an attack Iran has blamed on Israel. Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. In response, Iran has vowed ""severe"" retaliation against Israel. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response. The US, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Last year, the British government helped co-ordinate the evacuation of British nationals from Gaza, with some 200 UK citizens thought to be living in the territory before the war broke out. In 2021, over 15,000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan to the UK after the country fell to the Taliban.",UK military on standby for possible Lebanon evacuation,UK military on standby for possible Lebanon evacuation,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgj2nw4lgro,articles/article_3292.txt,results/article_3292.txt.json

A rocket strike on a playing field in Israeli-occupied Majdal Shams killed 12 young people on Saturday, sharply escalating fears of a new war in the region. Israel says the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group backed by Iran was behind the attack, though the group has denied this. Speaking in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the estimated 16,000 British people currently in Lebanon should ""leave"" while ""commercial flights are still running"". Live: Explosion hits Beirut suburb as Israel says it has 'targeted' Hezbollah commander Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer chaired a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday amid tensions in the Middle East. Saturday's attack is deadliest incident on what the de-facto Israel border with Lebanon since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. Majdal Shams is one of four towns in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. Late on Tuesday, at least one explosion hit a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, which is a base for Hezbollah. Israel's army said it had carried out a strike and that it was targeting the Hezbollah commander responsible for the attack on Majdal Shams. Hezbollah is a heavily armed militant and political movement based in Lebanon, Israel's northern neighbour is financed, equipped, and trained by Iran. Mr Lammy said the government ""cannot guarantee we'll be able to evacuate everyone immediately"" if the conflict escalates. He said he was ""working with Foreign Office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios"". He added: ""People may be forced to shelter in place and history teaches us that in a crisis like this one, it is far safer to leave while commercial flights are still running rather than running the risk of becoming trapped in a warzone. ""My message, then, to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave. "" Mr Lammy told MPs: ""We have begun the registration scheme that allows UK nationals to register their presence in Lebanon so we know where they are. ""Our estimation is that about 16,000 UK nationals are in the region, but of course asking people to register does enable us to know who is there and, of course, we urge people to leave on the many commercial flights that are available currently from Lebanon, to leave and make their way to Europe and back home.

3294,2024-09-02 16:14:14.881000+00:00,/news/articles/cd05pk95j2xo,"The UK has suspended some arms sales to Israel, saying there is a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. An Israeli minister told the BBC that the decision sent the ""wrong message"" and was ""disappointing"", but human rights group Amnesty International UK called the suspension ""too limited"". Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo. Speaking to Radio 4, Israel's minister for diaspora affairs, Amichai Chikli, said the decision had come ""at a very sensitive moment"" when Israelis were burying six people ""murdered in Hamas tunnels"". ""I think we need to combat terrorism together,"" he told the World Tonight programme. ""The fight against Isis [the Islamic State group], and al-Qaeda and Hamas, it's the same war between the Western civilisation and radical Islam. ""The threat that is coming from Hamas is also an inner threat that you are facing in the streets of the UK. ""Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to the decision that Israel operated according to international law. Writing on social media, the chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, said the move “beggars belief” and “feeds the falsehood that Israel is in breach of International Humanitarian Law”. “Sadly, this announcement will serve to encourage our shared enemies,” he added. Chief executive of Amnesty International UK, Sacha Deshmukh, criticised the restrictions as ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. “Today’s decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. Western governments have been coming under growing pressure to halt arms sales to Israel over how it is waging the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The foreign secretary said many MPs, lawyers and international organisations had raised concerns about British arms export licensing to Israel. He immediately sought a review of British arms exports to Israel after the Labour government took office in July, Mr Lammy added. He said the review did not and “could not arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law” - and this was ""not a determination of innocence or guilt"". But he said the government had its own legal duty to review all exports licences. Mr Lammy said: ""The assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation on international humanitarian law. ”He said the partial ban covered items ""which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza"". In a written summary of its decision, external, the government cited Israel's approach to Gaza aid and treatment of detainees as key factors in its decision. It did not explain how the suspended licences would affect these concerns. But parts made in the UK for the F35 fighters that Israel is using to strike targets in Gaza will not be included in the UK's ban because the planes are manufactured as part of a global programme. The decision is more significant politically than militarily - UK arms sales to Israel are small, just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, external. But it is still striking that one of Israel’s closest allies has judged there is a clear risk the country may use some of its arms exports to violate international humanitarian law. The announcement may come as no surprise to the government of Israel – it has long been flagged - but it will still hurt. The discussion about suspending arms sales began under the last Conservative government but it came to a head under the new Labour administration. Labour said it had not changed its position on supporting Israel's security, which it describes as ""solid"" and ""unyielding"". But this marks the third time since Labour took power in July that they have deviated from the previous Tory government's approach. Two weeks into government, Labour announced it would resume funding UNRWA, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees following a review of alleged links between its staff and terror groups. Days later Labour announced it was dropping plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Labour government has called for an immediate ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages and an increase in the amount of aid to civilians in Gaza. Some backbench Labour MPs have been urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to go further and ban British arms sales to Israel completely. Labour lost a number of former strongholds to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Palestinian platforms in the general election. Already the government’s critics are saying the suspension has not gone far enough. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said her party would ""carefully scrutinise"" the details of the announcement, ""including those export licences which the government has not suspended"". ""We are concerned that the decision is made solely on risk of use in Gaza and not the West Bank,"" she added. Green MP Ellie Chowns asked why so many licences were exempt from the suspension. ""I am very concerned that the government is not consistently applying the principle that there is a clear risk of UK licensed weapons being used in breach of international humanitarian law,"" she said. But Conservative MPs - including the shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell - have criticised the decision. Mr Mitchell said the move had ""all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour’s backbenches, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East"". ""I fear it will fail on both counts,"" he added. The Campaign Against Arms Trade says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth £574m ($727m) in total. Research by Parliament, external shows the value of licences granted has declined from £42m in 2022 to £18.2m in 2023.",UK suspends some arms exports to Israel,UK suspends some arms exports to Israel,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd05pk95j2xo,articles/article_3294.txt,results/article_3294.txt.json

Sir Keir told Masoud Pezeshkian there was a ""serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration"", Downing Street said. It is the first call between a UK prime minister and an Iranian president since March 2021 when former British leader Boris Johnson spoke to Hassan Rouhani. News of the 30-minute discussion came as the UK issued a joint statement with the US, France, Italy and Germany - urging Iran to end its threats of an attack on Israel.  They called on Iran to ""stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place"". The leaders, who spoke together by phone, also expressed their support for the ""defence of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups"". Fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East have been growing following the recent assassination of senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. On Sunday, the US confirmed it had sent a guided missile submarine to the region in response to these concerns. The submarine can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which are used to strike land targets. It had also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which is carrying F-35C fighter jets, to accelerate its journey there. The ship was already on its way to replace another US ship in the region. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later said that the US shared Israel's concerns that it was ""increasingly likely that there will be an attack by Iran and or its proxies and perhaps in the coming days"". ""That is why we have been continually speaking to our Israeli counterparts and other counterparts in the region,"" Mr Kirby added. Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said that the country took the threats of its enemies seriously and that Israel was at ""peak preparedness for attack and defence"". Downing Street also said on Monday that Keir Starmer had told Mr Pezeshkian he was ""deeply concerned by the situation in the region and called on all parties to de-escalate and avoid further regional confrontation"". Iran blames Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on their soil late last month and has vowed to punish it. Israel, which is currently engaged in a war attempting to destroy Hamas in Gaza following the group's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October, has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind the killing. Iran's acting foreign minister said last week that the country would respond to the killing of Haniyeh at the “right time” in the ""appropriate"" manner. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of states with Muslim-majority populations, said it held Israel fully responsible for the attack, which it called ""a serious infringement"" of Iran's sovereignty. Ismail Haniyeh is not the only senior member of Hamas to be killed recently. Israel also recently announced that the group's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. The Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, with which Israel is also engaged in a conflict, has also said that it would retaliate for the death of its senior commander Fuad Shukr. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the latest leader to urge his country's citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible, warning of the risk of growing tensions.

Speaking at the Hyde Park memorial event, her mother said: ""[Emily] is a daughter of both countries, but no one here mentions the fact that there is still a female British hostage being held captive by Hamas for a year now, and I sometimes wonder if people even know there is a British woman there. ""Imagine, for a moment if Emily was your daughter. Try to picture what she is going through.

She loved watching Spurs play, going to the pub, shopping at Primark and had also watched Ed Sheeran in concert, her mother said. Her mother pleaded with Britain and other countries to do more to secure the release of her daughter, and the other hostages. “How is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year? Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own. ” She said some of the women and children who were released in the hostage deal in November had told her Emily was alive then, and spoke about how she helped the other hostages try to stay positive, even in the worst of times. “Every day is living hell not knowing what Emily is going through. I do know from the hostages that returned that they were starved, sexually abused and tortured. Every moment lost is another moment of unimaginable suffering or even death. ”BBC News has approached the UK Foreign Office for comment. Other hostages with British relatives held include Eli Sharabi, Oded Lifschitz and Avinatan Or. British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell was also kidnapped on 7 October and his body was recovered by Israeli soldiers in Gaza in August. Families of Israeli hostages met Sir Keir and Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Monday, calling on them to ""do more"" to bring them home. The prime minister agreed that the hostages must be freed and returned immediately, a subsequent press conference was told. On Sunday, he said the country must ""unequivocally"" stand with the Jewish community and described 7 October as the ""darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust”. “As a father, a husband, a son, a brother – meeting the families of those who lost their loved ones last week was unimaginable. Their grief and pain are ours, and it is shared in homes across the land,"" Sir Keir said. He also reiterated his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.  The Hyde Park event, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups, was attended by thousands of British Jews and supporters of Israel who waved British and Israeli flags with chants of ""bring them home"". Among the crowd, many of whom have family and friends in Israel, there was disbelief that the hostages still had not been freed, one year on. Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely told the crowd: ""We will do whatever we can to bring them home.

"" A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attack was also held in Glasgow where hundreds gathered at the steps of Kelvingrove Art Gallery. On the eve of 7 October, a man was filmed damaging a Jewish memorial in Hove. Sussex Police responded to the video, which had been circulated on X and other social media platforms, and confirmed the incident was being treated as a ""hate crime"", external. On Saturday tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors marched through central London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","UK-Israeli hostage has been forgotten, says mum","UK-Israeli hostage has been forgotten, says mum","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3we9n0v79o,articles/article_3298.txt,results/article_3298.txt.json
3300,2024-09-19 08:08:25.311000+00:00,/news/articles/cdx9z96ldveo,"The UN General Assembly has adopted a Palestinian-drafted, non-binding resolution demanding Israel end ""its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"" within 12 months. There were 124 votes in favour and 14 against, including Israel, along with 43 abstentions. As a non-member observer state, Palestine could not vote. The resolution is based on a July advisory opinion from the UN's highest court that said Israel was occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip against international law. The Palestinian ambassador called the vote a turning point “in our struggle for freedom and justice”. But his Israeli counterpart denounced it as “diplomatic terrorism”. Although the General Assembly’s resolutions are not binding, they carry symbolic and political weight given they reflect the positions of all 193 member states of the UN. It comes after almost a year of war in Gaza, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. More than 41,110 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There has also been a spike in violence in the West Bank over the same period, in which the UN says more than 680 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed. Another 10 Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in Israel. The advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - which was also not legally binding - said a 15-judge panel had found that ""Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful” and that the country was “under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence. . . as rapidly as possible”. The court also said Israel should “evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory” and “make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned”. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements “have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law”, which Israel has consistently disputed. Israel's prime minister said at the time that the court had made a ""decision of lies"" and insisted that “the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land”. Wednesday’s General Assembly resolution, external welcomed the ICJ’s declaration. It demands that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. . . and do so no later than 12 months”, and “comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law”. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry described its passing as a “pivotal and historic moment for the Palestinian cause and international law”. It emphasised that the support of almost two thirds of UN member states reflected “a global consensus that the occupation must end and its crimes must cease”, and that it “reaffirmed the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination”. Israel’s foreign ministry called the resolution “a distorted decision that is disconnected from reality, encourages terrorism and harms the chances for peace”, adding: “This is what cynical international politics looks like. ”It said the resolution “bolsters and strengthens the Hamas terrorist organisation” and “sends a message that terrorism pays off and yields international resolutions”. It also accused the Palestinian Authority of “conducting a campaign whose goal is not to resolve the conflict but to harm Israel” and vowed to respond. The US, which voted against the resolution, warned beforehand that the text was “one-sided” and “selectively interprets the substance of the ICJ’s opinion”. “There is no path forward or hope offered through this resolution today. Its adoption will not save Palestinian lives, bring the hostages home, end Israeli settlements, or reinvigorate the peace process,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. The UK’s ambassador, Barbara Woodward, explained that it had abstained “not because we do not support the central findings of the ICJ's advisory opinion, but rather because the resolution does not provide sufficient clarity to effectively advance our shared aim of a peace premised on a negotiated two-state solution”.",UN General Assembly demands Israel ends occupation of Palestinian territories,UN General Assembly demands Israel ends occupation of Palestinian territories,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx9z96ldveo,articles/article_3300.txt,results/article_3300.txt.json
3303,2024-09-07 03:24:39.761000+00:00,/news/articles/c0l8rgz7rn4o,"The United Nations has called for a ""full investigation"" into the killing of a US-Turkish woman in the occupied West Bank during a protest on Friday. Local media reported that Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by Israeli forces as she took part in a weekly protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita near Nablus. Israel's military said it was ""looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area"". Ms Eygi's family said in a statement they were in shock and grief that the loving and ""fiercely passionate human rights activist"" was gone.  The family said video showed she was killed by a bullet from an Israeli military shooter and called for the US to investigate. The US has urged Israel to investigate the incident. Sean Savett, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Washington was ""deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen"". ""We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident,"" Mr Savett said. In a statement, Ms Eygi's family said, external that given the circumstances, an Israeli investigation ""is not adequate"" and called on the US to conduct an independent investigation and ""ensure full accountability for the guilty parties"". Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN secretary general, said: ""We would want to see a full investigation of the circumstances and that people should be held accountable. "" Civilians, he added, ""must be protected at all times"". Footage from the scene shortly after the shooting shows medics rushing Ms Eygi into an ambulance. Jewish-Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak, who was at the protest, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme he had seen ""soldiers on the rooftop aiming"". He said he had heard two separate shots, ""with like a second or two distance between them"". ""I heard someone calling my name, saying in English, 'Help us. We need help. We need help. ' I ran towards them,"" he said. He said he had then seen Ms Eygi ""lying on the ground underneath an olive tree, bleeding to death from her head"". ""I put my hand behind her back to try and stop the bleeding,"" he said. ""I looked up, there was a clear line of sight between the soldiers and where we were. I took her pulse, and it was very, very weak. ""He added that Friday's demonstration had been Ms Eygi's first time attending a protest with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group. The dual-national was rushed to a hospital in Nablus and later pronounced dead. Dr Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital where Ms Eygi was admitted, confirmed that a US citizen in her mid-20s had died from a ""gunshot in the head"". In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""During Israeli security forces activity adjacent to the area of Beita, the forces responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. ""The IDF is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review. ""In his interview with the BBC, Jonathan Pollak was asked about the IDF's statement, where the Israeli military said security forces had responded to stone-throwing. Mr Pollak said there had been clashes but he felt that soldiers had been ""under no threat"". There had been ""no stone throwing"" where she had been, he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken deplored the ""tragic loss"", while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded the Israeli action ""barbaric"". Ms Eygi's family said they were wrestling with the reality that she was gone. ""Like the olive tree she lay beneath where she took her last breaths, Aysenur was strong, beautiful, and nourishing. Her presence in our lives was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military,"" the family said. Her family called her a ""loving daughter, sister, partner, and aunt"" who was ""gentle, brave, silly, supportive, and a ray of sunshine"" and ""lived a life of caring for those in need with action"". Ms Eygi was born in Antalya, as reported by Turkish media. She graduated three months ago from the University of Washington in Seattle, where she studied psychology and Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures, her family said. She was active in campus student-led protests and felt compelled to travel to the West Bank to ""stand in solidarity with Palestinian civilians"". The University of Washington's president, Ana Mari Cauce, described news of Ms Eygi's death as ""awful"", adding that the former student was a ""positive influence"" on other students. Israeli forces withdrew from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Friday, following a major nine-day operation there. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - in that time. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. In the past 50 years, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.",UN calls for full inquiry into West Bank shooting,UN calls for full inquiry into West Bank shooting,"palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l8rgz7rn4o,articles/article_3303.txt,results/article_3303.txt.json
3305,2024-10-02 11:56:29.372000+00:00,/news/articles/cy43j9944lno,"The United Nations secretary general has condemned Iranian strikes on Israel, after earlier being banned from the country for his initial response. Speaking to the UN Security Council, António Guterres said it was high time to stop what he called the ""deadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence"" in the Middle East. In an earlier statement, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared Guterres persona non grata and an ""anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists"". The comments were issued in response to Guterres initially calling for a ceasefire, but not specifically mentioning the Iran attack.  Addressing the council, the UN secretary general said he had condemned the attack in April, and ""as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed, I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel"". ""These attacks paradoxically do not seem to support the cause of the Palestinian people, or reduce their suffering,"" he said. He also criticised Israel's actions in the region, calling the military campaign in Gaza ""the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years as secretary general"". On Tuesday, Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles into Israel, with Israel saying most of them were intercepted. In a statement after the attack on social media site X, formerly Twitter, Guterres said he condemned ""the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation"". Prior to Guterres remarks to the UN Security Council, Katz said in a statement that anyone who ""cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil"". He specifically criticised Guterres for ""his anti-Israel policy since the beginning of the war"". Tuesday's attack by Iran is the latest in a series of escalations, starting almost a year ago with attacks on Israel by Hamas, and recently involving increased fighting between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.

Since the attack, a military campaign in Gaza has now killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Over the course of the conflict, there have been a number of clashes between Israel and the United Nations about the situation in Gaza and the West Bank.  There has also been friction between Israel and the UN over the role of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. In January, Israel alleged that a number of the agency's staff members had been involved in the 7 October attacks. In response to this, the agency launched an investigation - with a number of its international funders withdrawing support for it, before later reinstating it. In August, nine staff members were dismissed over potential involvement in the attacks. During the conflict, UNRWA has criticised Israel for air strikes in Gaza which have killed its staff members.

The comments - made by a spokesperson for Secretary General Antonio Guterres - come as at least 10 people have reportedly been killed by Israeli artillery fire at a food distribution centre at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are continuing a ground offensive. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said shells hit inside and outside the centre on Monday morning as some hungry people were trying to get food handouts.

The UN said on Sunday that more than 50,000 people had fled the Jabalia area, but that others remained stranded in their homes amid increased bombardment and fighting on the ground. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said civilians must ""be protected at all times"". ""The secretary general condemns the large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza, including its schools, displacing sheltered Palestinian civilians,"" he told reporters at a news conference in New York. The offensive had also forced the closure of water wells, bakeries, medical points and shelters, as well as the suspension of other humanitarian services, including malnutrition treatment, it warned. The UN said it had not been allowed to deliver essential supplies, including food, since 1 October, with two nearby border crossings closed and no deliveries allowed from the south. The Israeli military said a convoy of 30 aid lorries entered through a crossing south of Gaza City on Sunday, when US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of what the White House called the “imperative to restore access to the north”. The military has ordered residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate to the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” in southern Gaza, saying it is “operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time”. But many of the estimated 400,000 Palestinians living in the north say they are reluctant to flee to the south, fearing that if they do they will not be allowed to return home. They believe the Israeli military is planning to implement a plan, proposed by retired Israeli generals, to completely empty the north of civilians and besiege Hamas fighters remaining there until they release Israeli hostages held since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. The Israeli military has denied it is implementing the plan. ""We are making sure we're getting civilians out of harm's way while we operate against those terror cells in Jabalia,"" spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told reporters. Overnight, four people were killed when an Israeli aircraft struck a tented camp for displaced people next to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. The Israeli military said it had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control centre in the area of a parking lot”, and that it took measures to mitigate harm to civilians. “Shortly after the strike, a fire ignited in the hospital's parking lot, most likely due to secondary explosions. The incident is under review,” Lt Col Shoshani wrote on X. “The hospital and its functionality were not affected from the strike. ”A video posted online appeared to show secondary explosions, external, but it was not clear whether they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. A spokesman for al-Aqsa hospital, Dr Khalil al-Daqran, said more than 50 tents were burned and that it was struggling to treat about 50 people who were injured, including children, women and the elderly, as well as casualties from other recent Israeli strikes. A resident of the camp, Umm Mahmoud Wadi, said her family lost everything. ""Where should I take my daughters? Winter is coming. There's no bedding, no clothes, nothing. I'm devastated. The gas bottle exploded - and we [our world] exploded. ”On Sunday night, more than 20 people were reportedly killed by tank fire at a UN-run school being used as a shelter for displaced families in Nuseirat refugee camp, which just north of Deir al-Balah. A spokeswoman for Unrwa told the BBC that it had been “another night of absolute horror for people in the Gaza Strip”. Louise Wateridge said the severe damage to al-Mufti school in Nuseirat meant it could not be used for the second round of the major polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, which began in the centre of the territory on Monday. Local medics and Unrwa workers are leading the effort to give drops of the vaccine to 590,000 children aged under 10 over the next two weeks. The campaign was organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef after the first case of polio in two decades was discovered in an unvaccinated baby in central Gaza, where 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now sheltering. UN officials are pressing for humanitarian pauses to be respected during the vaccination drive. “This is critical because we cannot issue vaccinations for children who are fleeing for their lives, who are forcibly displaced. We cannot issue vaccination while there are bombs coming from the sky,” Ms Wateridge said. She added: “These pauses are in the daytime, there are very specific timeframes for us to reach these thousands of children. The strikes and the military operations do continue around that and it's incredibly dangerous and terrifying experience to run any kind of humanitarian response in these conditions.

Ms Darwiche had worked in UNHCR's Bekaa office for 12 years. Meanwhile Ali Basma, who had worked for UNHCR's office in the southern city of Tyre as a cleaner, was also killed. In a statement, the agency said it was ""outraged and deeply saddened"" by their killing. ""Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon are now relentlessly claiming hundreds of civilian lives,"" said UNHCR's global director Filippo Grandi on Tuesday. ""And I am very saddened to confirm that two UNHCR colleagues were also killed yesterday. ""Ms Darwiche's friends described her as ""the gentlest and kindest soul we knew.

He told Reuters news agency that he had left his house in the town of Saksakiyeh on Monday to complete paperwork identifying his family.

Israel says it targeted Hezbollah sites, accusing the Iranian-backed group of hiding weapons and rockets in residential homes and of using civilians as human shields. On Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue attacking Hezbollah sites. Israel has alleged that some weapons are being stored in civilian homes. ""Anyone who has a missile in their living room and a rocket in their garage will not have a home,"" he said in a video posted on social media.

3309,2024-10-16 20:16:51.635000+00:00,/news/articles/czxdzynrp61o,"Israel has denied obstructing humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, after the US warned its ally in a letter to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off. The first aid in two weeks was allowed into northern Gaza following the letter, but the UN's acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya described it as a “trickle”. In the letter sent on Sunday, the US expressed deep concern at the humanitarian situation and said Israeli actions had contributed to it. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told the Security Council that it had “flooded Gaza with as much aid as possible” and accused the Palestinian armed group Hamas of stealing and selling shipments. Ms Msuya warned that essential supplies are running out for about 400,000 Palestinians in the north, amid an Israeli ground offensive against what the military says are regrouping Hamas fighters in and around the Jabalia area. The strongly worded letter sent by the Biden administration accuses Israel of halting commercial imports to Gaza, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south in September, placing excessive restrictions on dual-use goods, and instituting new vetting and customs requirements for humanitarian staff. The letter says Israel ""must, starting now and within 30 days"" act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, citing US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid. It says Israel must ""surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza"" before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing the 1.7 million displaced people crowded in the coastal al-Mawasi “humanitarian area” to move inland. It also calls on Israel to ensure deliveries via the Jordanian land corridor are not impeded and to end the ""isolation of northern Gaza"". The Israeli government has not responded to the letter since it was leaked on Tuesday, but Mr Danon told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that “the issue in Gaza is not a lack of aid”. “More than enough aid has entered to sustain every civilian in Gaza, with over one million tonnes delivered since the war began. Yet, the challenges continue - yes, we admit that. And it's not due to Israel's efforts of failure to deliver humanitarian assistance,” he said. “The real issue is Hamas. This terrorist organisation has hijacked the aid, saving it for their own purposes. They steal and even sell the aid that is intended for Gazan civilians, turning humanitarian relief into a profit machine. ""Hamas has previously denied stealing aid and said Israel is to blame for shortages. Israel is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza making it difficult to verify facts on the ground. Earlier, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said aid had been delivered to northern Gaza for the third consecutive day following a two-week period when the UN said no aid was allowed in. Fifty lorries carrying food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment from Jordan crossed via the Erez West crossing, it added. The UN meanwhile confirmed that almost 30 lorry loads of aid had entered the north on Monday and another 12 lorry loads the following day. Ms Msuya said that constituted a “trickle” and that “all essential supplies for survival are running out”. “There is now barely any food left to distribute, and most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in the next several days without additional fuel,” she said. “Given the abject conditions and intolerable suffering in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly non-existent is unconscionable. ” The US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the Biden administration had made it clear that “food and supplies must be surged into Gaza immediately”. She also warned that a “policy of starvation” in northern Gaza would be “horrific and unacceptable”. “The government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel’s actions on the ground match this statement,” she added. Ms Msuya also warned that the three hospitals still partially operational in and around Jabalia were facing dire shortages of fuel, blood, trauma treatment and medications. They have been overwhelmed by casualties caused by the intense Israeli bombardment and fighting on the ground between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters over the past 11 days. More than 50,000 people have fled their homes in response, but others remain stranded with water and food running out. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,400 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","UN says 'trickle' of aid reaches north Gaza, as Israel denies blocking access","UN says 'trickle' of aid reaches north Gaza, as Israel denies blocking access","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxdzynrp61o,articles/article_3309.txt,results/article_3309.txt.json
3310,2024-08-26 16:49:55.518000+00:00,/news/articles/cr40d32zqz4o,"The United Nations says it has had to temporarily suspend its aid operation in the Gaza Strip because of Israeli military evacuation orders in the centre of the Palestinian territory. A senior UN official told reporters that its humanitarian staff had been unable to operate on Monday because of safety concerns. Evacuation orders covering parts of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in and around the central town of Deir al-Balah - where the UN has its main operations centre - had forced staff to relocate quickly and leave equipment behind, they said. However, the official stressed that UN agencies would not be leaving Gaza and were now trying to find somewhere to operate safely. The Israeli military has said it issues evacuation orders to try to protect civilians as it operates against Hamas and other armed groups. Earlier on Monday, it said troops were continuing to “dismantle terrorist infrastructure” and “eliminate terrorists” on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Up to 88.5% of Gaza has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the UN, which is the primary provider and distributor of humanitarian aid in the territory. That has forced an estimated 1.8 million people to shelter inside the humanitarian zone, which spans only about 41 sq km (15.8 sq miles) and lacks critical infrastructure and basic services. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Local officials in Deir al-Balah say about 250,000 people have been forced to flee several neighbourhoods of the town since 16 August, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) started to issue evacuation orders there. Humanitarian staff from various UN agencies, NGOs and service providers, along with their families, have also been displaced as a result of the orders. The UN said a new order issued on Sunday that covered one block in the south of the town, external had affected 15 UN and NGO premises, as well as four UN warehouses. ""We're unable to deliver today with the conditions that we're in,"" the senior UN official said on Monday. ""As of this morning, we're not operating in Gaza. ""However, UN staff have been instructed to find solutions to allow operations to resume. ""We're not leaving because the people need us there,"" the official said. ""We're trying to balance the need of the population with the need for safety and security of the UN personnel. ""Sam Rose, a senior deputy field director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) who is in Deir al-Balah, warned that both UN staff and Palestinian civilians were “being squeezed into ever smaller areas of Gaza”. “The humanitarian zone declared by Israel has shrunk. It is now about 11% of the entire Gaza Strip,” he told reporters in New York via video link. “This isn’t just 11% of land that is fit for habitation, fit for services, fit for life. These are sand dunes, these are crowded areas, where people are living cheek by jowl, doing whatever they can to get by. ”“It is precisely in these circumstances that polio has recently re-emerged in Gaza, with a small number of cases. It could spread very rapidly,” he added. “Malnourished children. A decimated healthcare sector. Very poor water and sanitation. People living amid garbage, amid lakes of sewage. They’re stressed, they’re anxious, their immune systems are suppressed. ”Mr Rose said Unrwa and other UN agencies had been focusing their efforts on the polio vaccination campaign due to start this Saturday, which plans to inoculate more than 640,000 children and prevent an outbreak. “The vaccines have come in. We’re calling for calm, for humanitarian pauses that will allow the vaccination programmes to pass and be implemented successfully. ” Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also warned that the latest evacuation order in Deir al-Balah also affected areas close to al-Aqsa hospital, the town’s main medical facility. The medical charity said in a statement on X that an explosion about 250m (820ft) from the hospital on Sunday had triggered panic, with many people choosing to leave afterwards. “As a result, MSF is considering whether to suspend wound care for the time being, while trying to maintain life-saving treatment. From around 650 patients, only 100 remain in the hospital, with seven in intensive care unit, according to the ministry of health,” it added. “This situation is unacceptable. Al-Aqsa has been operating well beyond capacity for weeks due to the lack of alternatives for patients. All warring parties must respect the hospital, as well as patients' access to medical care. ”Dr Anas Ibrahim, an emergency physician at the hospital, told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme on Monday that the situation there was “indescribable”. “As the evacuation news spread, patients with fractures and wounds all began to evacuate the hospital for fear of being exposed to an offensive,” he said. “Feelings of terror, fear and panic have overwhelmed all people at the hospital. Everyone is afraid now. . . everyone is waiting to see what will happen. ”The IDF said the evacuation order did not include nearby hospitals or medical facilities and that patients and medical staff did not need to leave.",UN says Gaza aid operation paused due to evacuation orders,UN says Gaza aid operation paused due to evacuation orders,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr40d32zqz4o,articles/article_3310.txt,results/article_3310.txt.json
3311,2024-09-11 20:32:25.278000+00:00,/news/articles/clyn400rm68o,"The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says six of its employees have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school it runs in central Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said a total of 18 people were killed in Wednesday’s strike on al-Jaouni school in Nuseirat refugee camp, which is being used as a shelter by thousands of displaced Palestinians. Israel's military said it carried out a “precise strike on terrorists” planning attacks from the school. On Thursday, the military alleged that nine of those killed were members of Hamas’s armed wing and that three of them were Unrwa staff. Unrwa said the Israeli military had not requested a list of the staff who were killed, and that the names published by the military had not been previously flagged to the agency by Israeli authorities. Earlier, UN Secretary General António Guterres condemned the strike, saying: “What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable. ”“These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, hit out at Guterres' criticism. “It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields,” he said. Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other countries - has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,110 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Unrwa said Wednesday’s strike on al-Jaouni school had resulted in ""the highest death toll among our staff in a single incident"" since the start of the war. It was also the fifth time the school had been hit over the same period, it added. Video of the aftermath showed hundreds of people inspecting the heavily damaged ground floor of one wing of the school, as well as the remains of an adjoining structure that appeared to have been destroyed. Other footage showed ambulances bringing wounded men, women and children said to have been hurt in the strike to al-Aqsa hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah. “My friend and her children were injured, and the director and deputy director [of the shelter] were martyred. They were inside the office when the shelling started,” one woman told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme. “It's hard to describe the horrible scene where their bodies were torn into pieces,” she added. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said on Wednesday night that 18 people were killed, including Unrwa staff members, children and women, and that 18 others were injured. A Telegram post from the agency identified one of those killed as the daughter of one of its rescue workers, Momin Salmi. It said he had not seen Shadia for 10 months because he had stayed in northern Gaza while his wife and their eight children had fled southwards. The BBC was not able to independently verify the death toll, but a medical source at al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat camp told AFP that a total of 15 people killed in the strike had been brought there and to al-Aqsa hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that aircraft had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a Hamas command and control centre” embedded inside al-Jaouni school. “Numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence,” it added. “This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organisation’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law. ”Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office accused Israel of a “brutal massacre”. Later, Unrwa said in a statement that two air strikes had hit the school and its surroundings, which were home to around 12,000 displaced people, mainly women and children. ""Among those killed was the manager of the Unrwa shelter and other team members providing assistance to displaced people,"" it said. The agency insisted that ""schools and other civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times"", adding: ""They are not a target. """"We call on all parties to the conflict to never use schools or the areas around them for military or fighting purposes. "" On Thursday afternoon, the IDF put out a statement saying that it had repeatedly requested from Unrwa the names of the employees who were killed in the strike, but that it had received “no answers”. It then named nine men who it alleged were “Hamas terrorists. . . confirmed to have been eliminated in the strike”, external. The IDF said all nine were members of Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, and that three of them were “simultaneously an Unrwa employee”. Three names featured on a list of the six Unrwa workers which was earlier released by the UN. “How long will the UN continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over Unrwa?” Mr Danon said. “These murderers are not aid workers. They are terrorists with blood on their hands and were rightly eliminated. ”Unrwa’s communications director, Juliette Touma, said Israeli authorities had not requested a list of staff killed from the agency. “The names that appear on today’s statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today,” she said. “Unrwa shares the lists of all its staff with the host governments and in the context of the West Bank and Gaza also with the state of Israel as the occupying power. ”Ms Touma also stressed that Unrwa had repeatedly called on the warring parties to never use civilian facilities for military purposes. “Now whether this particular school or other have been used for that very purpose, Unrwa is not in a position to determine,” she added. “This is precisely why we have repeatedly called for independent investigations to look into these very serious claims. ”Israel has previously accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas. The agency has denied this, but the UN said in August that it had fired nine of Unrwa's 13,000 staff in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the 7 October attack. Another 10 staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence. Israel also alleged that hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims. Hours before the incident, Unrwa said in a situation report that almost 70% of its schools in Gaza had been hit during the war. It also reported that 214 of its staff members had been killed, along with at least 563 displaced people who had been sheltering inside its schools and other installations. In a separate development on Wednesday, the IDF announced that two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others injured in a helicopter crash overnight in southern Gaza. The helicopter was on a mission to evacuate a critically injured soldier to a hospital for medical treatment and crashed while landing in the Rafah area, a statement said. “An initial inquiry conducted indicates that the crash was not caused by enemy fire. The cause of the crash is still under investigation,” it added.",UN says Israeli strike on Gaza school killed six of its staff,UN says Israeli strike on Gaza school killed six of its staff,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyn400rm68o,articles/article_3311.txt,results/article_3311.txt.json

In a statement, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said two Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tanks destroyed the main gate of a post in Ramyah, near the Israeli border, and ""forcibly entered the position"" to request it turn out its lights. About two hours later, it said rounds were fired nearby that saw smoke enter the camp, causing 15 peacekeepers to suffer skin irritations and gastrointestinal reactions. The IDF offered a different version of events, saying it had encroached on a Unifil position to evacuate soldiers who had been wounded by an anti-tank missile. Follow live updates on this storyAnalysing footage from the Gaza strikesWatch: ‘I say bye to my kids, in case we don’t wake up’ – two Gazans film a year under attack by IsraelAnalysis: Drone attack on Israel puts spotlight on Iron Dome's limitations It said two soldiers had been ""seriously injured"" in the attack, with others suffering lesser degrees of injury. ""For the sake of evacuating the wounded, two tanks drove backwards, in a place where they could not advance otherwise in light of the threat of shooting, a few metres towards the Unifil position,"" the IDF said. It added that during the incident, a smoke screen was fired to aid the evacuation - and that it had ""maintained continuous contact"" with Unifil, stressing there was ""no threat to the Unifil force from IDF activities"". UN secretary general António Guterres warned any attacks on peacekeepers ""may constitute a war crime"", adding that ""Unifil personnel and its premises must never be targeted"". ""Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law, including international humanitarian law,"" Mr Guterres said, according to a statement from his spokesman. The incident is the latest in a growing number of encounters between Unifil and Israeli forces. Israel has repeatedly urged the peacekeeping force to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon where fighting was taking place, after it began a ground incursion on 30 September targeting the armed group Hezbollah. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Unifil to ""immediately"" get its troops ""out of harm's way"" in a video statement issued by his office on Sunday, claiming that their presence in the region made them ""hostages of Hezbollah"". Unifil has so far refused these requests. Israel has faced international condemnation for previous instances in which Unifil troops have been injured in southern Lebanon - with the IDF admitting responsibility for firing toward UN posts in some cases. Unifil said: ""For the fourth time in as many days, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times. ""It described the breach of its post in Ramyah as ""a further flagrant violation of international law"". Unifil added that on Saturday Israeli troops had blocked them from carrying out a ""critical"" logistical movement near Meiss El Jebel, also near the border. The IDF has yet to comment on that incident. But it alleged that Hezbollah had fired around 25 rockets and missiles in the last month from sites located near Unifil sites. It accused the armed group of ""exploiting their proximity to UN forces"". Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near daily cross-border fire since last October, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the ""Blue Line"". Israel has previously asked Unifil to withdraw north by 5km (3 miles).  Prior to Sunday's incidents, five peacekeepers had been injured in recent days. On Saturday, Unifil said a soldier had been shot at its headquarters in the city of Naquora - though it did not know the origin of the bullet. The day before, the IDF said its troops were responsible for an incident in which two Unifil troops from Sri Lanka were injured. On Thursday, two Indonesian Unifil soldiers were injured falling from an observation tower after an Israeli tank fired towards it. Those incidents prompted rebukes from several of Israel's allies, including France, Italy and Spain. A Downing Street spokesperson said the UK was ""appalled"". In his comments on Sunday, Netanyahu said European leaders should direct their criticism towards Hezbollah, not Israel. Israel argues that Unifil has failed to stabilise the region and prevent Hezbollah fighters from operating south of the Litani River - among the reasons for a UN presence there. It has previously said that it was acting on a 2004 UN resolution calling for the disbanding of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militant groups, and that its request for peacekeepers to withdraw was so it could confront Hezbollah. Netanyahu said these appeals had been ""met with refusals"", and that Unifil was providing a ""human shield to Hezbollah terrorists"". ""This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers,"" he added. ""We regret the injuring of Unifil soldiers and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injuring. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone. ""Unifil officials have repeatedly refused to withdraw troops from the region. The body's spokesman Andrea Tenenti told the AFP news agency on Saturday that there had been a ""unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region"". Lebanon's Prime Minister Nijab Mikati condemned Netanyahu's position. In a statement, he said the Israeli PM's comments represented ""a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international legitimacy"".

3313,2024-08-05 17:29:17.190000+00:00,/news/articles/cnvyyz8461yo,"Nine staff members at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel, the United Nations says. All nine would have their employment terminated, said UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq. He said the UN had completed an investigation following allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff were involved. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 38,400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Haq did not specify what the men's precise involvement may have been. ""For us, any participation in the attacks is a tremendous betrayal of the sort of work that we are supposed to be doing on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" he said. An Israeli Defense Forces spokeperson said the report showed UNRWA had hit a ""new low"". The UN investigated 19 members of UNRWA staff in all, after Israel alleged that 12 took part in the attack. Israel later claimed that more than 450 UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims. Aside from the nine employees who the UN said may have had links to the 7 October attack, its report found no evidence of involvement in one case, and insufficient evidence in the case of nine others. UNRWA, which employs 13,000 people in Gaza, said in March that some of its employees reported being pressured by Israeli authorities into making false statements while in detention. Most countries withdrew funding for the UN agency because of the Israeli allegations. In July, the UK joined other countries that had resumed funding since then, leaving the US, UNRWA's single biggest donor, as the only country not to have restarted donations.

3315,2024-08-26 11:01:09.054000+00:00,/news/articles/cr40dz5524qo,"UN Secretary General António Guterres has said he is “deeply concerned” after Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement mounted their biggest round of cross-border strikes since the war in Gaza began. On Sunday, Israeli jets hit dozens of sites across southern Lebanon in what it said were pre-emptive strikes to prevent a much wider attack, and Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel. Mr Guterres warned that their actions put civilians at risk, as well as threatening regional security and stability. The US said it was working to avoid a further escalation in hostilities, and both sides suggested they were not interested in one. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Since October, more than 560 people have been reported killed by Lebanon's health ministry, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, while 26 civilians and 24 soldiers have been killed in Israel, according to authorities. Almost 200,000 people have also been displaced on both sides of the border. The Israeli attack on Hezbollah began before dawn Sunday, when the military said about 100 jets bombed thousands rocket launchers at more than 40 sites in southern Lebanon. The strikes were launched after ""extensive preparation"" for a large-scale aerial attack by Hezbollah were detected, according to the military. Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed in the strikes along with another fighter from the allied Amal movement. Hezbollah said it had targeted and hit 11 military facilities in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights with 340 rockets and a “large number” of drones. It described the barrage as a response to the assassination of senior military commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on 30 July. The Israeli military said it intercepted “many of the threats” launched by Hezbollah and that the projectiles which landed did “very little damage”. However, it also said a navy soldier was killed in combat in northern Israel, with local media reporting that he had been on a patrol boat when an interceptor missile engaged a drone. On Sunday evening, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a televised speech to his supporters that appeared to seek to draw a line under the escalation. He declared the group’s “first response” for the retaliation for Shukr’s assassination had been completed “as planned”, although he noted that its impact was still being assessed. ""If the result is not sufficient, we will reserve the right to respond at another time,” he said. In the meantime, he added, the people of Lebanon “can be at ease and carry on with their lives, as the country has been in tension for a month now”. Earlier, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a cabinet meeting that “what happened today is not the end of the story”. “We are striking Hezbollah with surprising crushing blows,” he said. “Three weeks ago, we eliminated its chief-of-staff and today we thwarted its attack plan. ”“Nasrallah in Beirut and [Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes. ”The UN secretary general called for “immediate de-escalation and on the parties to urgently and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities”, a spokesperson said. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan expressed hope that Sunday’s events would not lead to an all-our regional war. ""We have worked round the clock with partners and allies, moving military assets, engaging in intensive diplomacy both publicly and privately behind the scenes to avert that outcome,” he told reporters during a visit to Halifax, Canada. Diplomats told the Reuters news agency that the two sides had exchanged messages saying that neither wanted to take things any further. Mr Sullivan also said US officials had been “feverishly working” at talks in Cairo in recent days to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, which the White House believes is key to restoring calm on the Israel-Lebanon border. However, there has so far been no sign of a breakthrough. Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that its representatives had left the Egyptian capital to review the outcome of the talks, which they did not attend. Egyptian security sources told Reuters news agency that neither Hamas nor Israel had agreed to several compromises presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.",UN urges calm after Israel and Hezbollah trade strikes,UN urges calm after Israel and Hezbollah trade strikes,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr40dz5524qo,articles/article_3315.txt,results/article_3315.txt.json
3316,2024-10-15 16:50:47.175000+00:00,/news/articles/crej40034r2o,"The UN’s human rights office has called for an investigation into an Israeli air strike that killed 23 people in northern Lebanon on Monday. Spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the strike, on the Christian-majority village of Aitou, raised ""real concerns"" with respect to international humanitarian law. Laurence said that 12 women and two children were understood to be among the dead from the bombing, which destroyed a residential building that had been recently rented out to a family displaced from the south. Rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble in Aitou on Tuesday - far from the focus of the conflict to date in the south of Lebanon, Beqaa Valley and parts of Beirut. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is yet to comment on the strike. Elie Alwan, the owner of the house in Aitou, told reporters that it had been rented to a family of around 10 people, who were later joined by around 10 more. Alwan said there had been no problems with the tenants until a car came to the house on Monday - the driver apparently delivering cash – when the air strike hit. Israeli air strikes on members of Hezbollah in the areas where the group usually operates have pushed its members to other parts of the country, creating fears across Lebanon that Israeli targets could be anywhere. An Aitou resident, Sarkis Alwan, told the AFP news agency that the village “maybe. . . won't welcome” displaced people anymore. ""And villagers who have taken in displaced people, I think they will ask them to leave,"" he said. Israel has demonstrated a willingness during its recent escalation to strike residential buildings without warning as it attempts to degrade Hezbollah, which has been sporadically firing rockets into Israel for a year since the day after the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. On Thursday night, an Israeli strike hit a residential building in central Beirut killing 22 people, according to figures from the Lebanese health ministry. Unconfirmed reports said that the strike, which came with no warning and wounded 117, targeted Wafiq Safa, a senior member of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that is a powerful force in Lebanon. The reports said that the strike failed to kill him and Hezbollah has not commented on his status. Israel says it is necessary to take on Hezbollah in order for people in the north of the country to be able to return to their homes. A drone attack launched by Hezbollah on a military base in northern Israel killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday and severely wounded seven more - the deadliest strike by the group since Israel launched a ground invasion of Lebanon two weeks ago. Also on Tuesday, the UN refugee agency said that more than a quarter of Lebanon was now covered by Israeli military evacuation orders. ""People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing,” the agency's Middle East director Rema Jamous Imseis told a press briefing. The evacuation orders, coupled with Israel’s ground invasion and bombing campaign, have driven a massive exodus of Lebanese people from the affected areas. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced, according to the Lebanese government. They have fled villages and major cities in the south, and moved north to Beirut, Tripoli and other cities. Many have ended up in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in shelters in and around the capital, where schools and shops have been closed to house people. The sheer volume of displaced people has overwhelmed welfare services, the mayor’s office told the BBC, leaving thousands of displaced people on the streets. Using plans made for the previous invasion, in 2006, the municipality had prepared for just 10% of the actual number of people, mayor Abdallah Darwich told the BBC last week. “We did not imagine it could be this huge,” he said. “Every day our calculations have become larger and larger. ”The Israeli strikes on Beirut, focused on the southern suburb of Dahieh, had become a daily and nightly occurrence over the past three weeks, but the capital has not been hit for nearly five days. On Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington had raised ""concerns"" with the Israeli government over the “scope and nature” of its bombing of Beirut in recent weeks. “Israel does have a right to defend itself against those terrorists who pose a threat to the state of Israel, but we've had real concerns about the nature of the campaign that we saw roll out across Beirut over the past few weeks,” he said. “We’ve seen [the number of strikes] come down over the past few days,” he added. Following the Hezbollah drone strike on Sunday, Netanyahu threatened on Monday night that he would continue striking the group in Lebanon “without mercy”, including Beirut. On Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said in a phone call with President Emmanuel Macron that he was opposed to ""a unilateral ceasefire, which would not change the security situation in Lebanon and would return the country to its previous state"". Earlier in the day, the deputy leader of Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, issued his own threat to Israel, saying the group had ""a new calculation"" to inflict pain on its enemy. At the same time, Qassem, speaking in a televised address, called for a ceasefire, saying that it was the only solution to the current conflict. ""If the Israelis do not want that, we will continue,"" he added. Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,309 people over the last year, according to figures from the Lebanese government, which does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

Jane Hartley was en route to see the work in Shoreditch on Monday morning but was diverted after the demonstrators arrived on the scene. About 25 people turned up at the site of the mural, where they unveiled banners critical of US policy on Israel and waved Palestinian flags. The ambassador told BBC London the 7 October anniversary was a "" very sad day"" and that she believed ""in the right to protest and for free speech"". The mural, entitled Rise Above Earth Justice, is the work of artist and activist Shepard Fairey, most famous for his 2008 Obama ""Hope"" poster. Asked if she thought it was an appropriate day to unveil the mural, Hartley said: ""When planned, it was because Shepard was finishing the mural and we wanted to announce it during Frieze Week, external, because we thought it was an example of what art should be doing: getting communities involved, bringing communities together. ""We want to get the hostages home; we feel for these families that have suffered such pain. We want a ceasefire and we want humanitarian aid going in to help the people - children, babies, families,"" the ambassador told the BBC. Fairey created the mural at the suggestion of Hartley, who was appointed as the US ambassador to the UK by President Joe Biden in July 2022. The mural, which was inspired by a series of workshops held earlier this year with young people from London, aims to highlight the importance of climate awareness. Fairey said the mural, which features a 50ft (15m) flower, uses symbols to convey the message that it is ""within our power to rise above the injustice of environmental irresponsibility and push for a more healthy planet"". The artist said: ""I believe that our individual and collective actions will dramatically impact current and future generations, be it for the better or for the worse. It is our responsibility as the citizens of Earth to protect it.

The 12-strong bloc proposed an immediate 21-day pause in fighting ""to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement"" and a ceasefire in Gaza. In a joint statement, they said the hostilities were ""intolerable"" and presented an ""unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation"" that was neither in the interest of the people of Israel or Lebanon. It comes after Israel’s military chief told troops on Wednesday that extensive air strikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah could pave the way for them to “enter enemy territory”.  The remarks by Lt Gen Halevi are the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent. The joint statement was signed by the US, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar. It followed a meeting of world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York. A separate joint statement by US President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time for a settlement ""that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes"". The current hostilities threaten ""a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians"", they said. ""We therefore have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border. ""President Biden briefly spoke to reporters at the White House on Wednesday evening, saying there is ""significant support from Europe as well as the Arab nations … it’s important the war does not widen"". A senior administration official told the BBC neither Israel nor Lebanon has accepted the proposal - although the US is in touch with both governments. Official responses are expected within hours. The official said a 21-day pause in fighting would be a “sustained phase” that would allow for further negotiations to take place to reach a “complicated agreement”. They added that the US is negotiating with Lebanon’s government - rather than Hezbollah. It would then be the responsibility of the Lebanese government to engage with “non-state actors”. Earlier in New York, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate ceasefire, and said ""hell is breaking loose"". Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said his country is ""facing a blatant violation of our sovereignty and human rights through the brutal practices of the Israeli enemy"". He added he hoped he could leave the UN session with a ""serious solution"" to ""put pressure on Israel to achieve an immediate ceasefire on all fronts"". Asked by Reuters if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he responded: ""Hopefully, yes. ""Also speaking earlier, Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said it was grateful for diplomatic efforts to avoid escalation but would ""use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our aims"". He said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war"", and has made its desire for peace ""clear"". Mr Danon added that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in New York on Thursday, have bilateral meetings later that day and speak at the General Assembly the following morning. More than 600 people have been reported killed across Lebanon since Monday, when Israel began an intense air campaign to destroy what it said was infrastructure built up by Hezbollah since they last fought a war in 2006. Another 90,000 people in Lebanon have been newly displaced, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes before the escalation, according to the UN. Almost 40,000 are living in shelters across the country. Nearly a year of deadly cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza has also displaced around 70,000 people in northern Israel, whose safe return the Israeli government and military say they want to ensure. Hezbollah says it is attacking Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, Hamas, and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Cross-border fighting continued on Wednesday, with Hezbollah saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency with a missile fired towards Tel Aviv - the first time Hezbollah has targeted the heavily populated area. It was intercepted by air defences and there were no reports of damage or casualties. Hezbollah also fired dozens more rockets into northern Israel, injuring two. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that the strikes had killed at least 51 people and injured 223, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. It comes after an unprecedented wave of attacks on Hezbollah. Last week, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members to communicate exploded in two waves across Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for the attacks. Then, an Israeli air strike on Friday on the group’s stronghold of Dahieh, in southern Beirut, essentially wiped out the chain of command of its main fighting unit, the Radwan Force. The group confirmed that one of its top military leaders, Ibrahim Aqil, was among 55 people killed.",US and allies call for 21-day ceasefire across Lebanon-Israel border ,US and allies call for 21-day ceasefire across Lebanon-Israel border ,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20m1d77m86o,articles/article_3318.txt,results/article_3318.txt.json
3322,2024-08-20 22:18:50.587000+00:00,/news/articles/cd6ynq1jwdqo,"A senior US administration official has pushed back at reported comments by Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the Israeli prime minister of making “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. It comes in the midst of an intense round of regional diplomacy by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as Washington tries to drive forward progress on a ceasefire and hostage release deal. On Monday, Mr Blinken had talks lasting three hours with the Israeli leader in Jerusalem. He later said Mr Netanyahu had accepted Washington’s so-called “bridging proposal” aimed at trying to solve sticking points and bring Israel and Hamas closer to a deal. According to an Israeli media report, Mr Netanyahu later told a meeting of hostage families that he ""convinced"" Mr Blinken that the deal must see Israeli troops remaining in areas of Gaza he described as “strategic military and political assets”, including along the southern border with Egypt. The reported comments appear to have irritated the US administration. ""We saw the prime minister's comments, specifically on some of these items,"" said the senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We’re certainly not going to negotiate in public but what I can say is that the only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting a ceasefire proposal across the finish line. """"We fully expect that… if Hamas were also to also accept this bridging proposal, discussions will continue on some of the more technical. . . details. “I would also just add that maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line and they certainly risk the ability of implementing level, working level and technical talks to be able to move forward when both parties agree to a bridging proposal. ”The senior official’s remarks followed Tuesday’s round of talks between Mr Blinken and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the coastal city of El-Alamein. Egyptian officials are said to be strongly opposed to the idea of Israeli troops remaining along Egypt's border in Gaza. Following his stop in Egypt, Mr Blinken travelled on to Qatar for further talks in Doha - the last stop on his Middle East tour. The BBC has been travelling with the secretary of state and asked him about the conversation shortly before he left Doha. He revealed for the first time that the American bridging proposal included a ""detailed plan"" about Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. ""The agreement is very clear on the schedule and locations of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawals from Gaza and Israel has agreed to that,"" said Mr Blinken. Asked by the BBC whether Mr Netanyahu's reported claim that the Israeli leader had ""convinced"" Mr Blinken to keep troops in Gaza, he said: ""I can't speak to what he's quoted as saying, I can just speak to what I heard from him directly yesterday [Monday] when we spent three hours together,"" he said. ""[That included] Israel's endorsement of the bridging proposal and thus the detailed plan. And that plan among other things includes a very clear schedule and locations for withdrawals. ""Asked whether the proposal was for a ""full withdrawal"", Mr Blinken said he would not comment on the details of the plan. Hamas said the latest ceasefire proposals constituted ""a coup"" against what had been agreed upon in earlier negotiations, and reiterated its wish that a ceasefire plan for Gaza be based on where talks were in July rather than any new rounds of negotiations.",US criticises Israeli PM's 'maximalist' ceasefire stance,US criticises Israeli PM's 'maximalist' ceasefire stance,"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6ynq1jwdqo,articles/article_3322.txt,results/article_3322.txt.json

A Pentagon statement said President Joe Biden had ordered the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) battery and its crew be sent ""to defend Israel"". Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on 1 October. The Israeli military said most were intercepted, but a number struck central and southern Israel. Israel has not yet said how it will respond to the attack, but Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said it will be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"".

The Pentagon said the Thaad deployment ""underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran"". The US sent a Thaad battery to the Middle East after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. It previously sent a Thaad battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an air defence exercise. But the US deploying a crew to Israel is more rare. Iran said its 1 October missile barrage was a response to Israel's assassinations of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) officer in Beirut, and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah in recent weeks, carrying out deadly air strikes across southern and eastern Lebanon and in parts of Beirut. Before that, Israel and Hezbollah had been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis since last October, when Hezbollah began firing into Israel which it said was a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza. It had said it would stop firing if there was a ceasefire in Gaza. However, international efforts to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza have so far failed.  The US announcement underlines its growing concern about ballistic missiles targeting Israel. Thaad provides yet another layer of intercept protection against what are called endo and exo (inside and outside) atmospheric threats. It costs around a billion dollars a battery. Manufacturer Lockheed Martin describes the system as highly effective against short, medium and long-range targets. Thaad missiles, which have a reported range of up to 200km (124 miles), are of a ""hit to kill"" variety, rather than using proximity detonation to bring down targets. Israel's missile defence comprises the Iron Dome for short-range rockets, David's Sling for longer range weapons and cruise missiles, plus Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 against ballistic missiles launched from over 1,000km (621 miles) away. Countering ballistic missiles threats is particularly difficult because of those missiles' high speed and the rapid rate of change of aspect in flight - particularly during their terminal phase. According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Hezbollah in Lebanon has some 150,000 rockets - mainly supplied by Iran - at its disposal.",US deploys Thaad anti-missile system to Israel after Iranian attack,US deploys Thaad anti-missile system to Israel after Iranian attack,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20jye8v5dro,articles/article_3323.txt,results/article_3323.txt.json
3324,2024-11-20 19:21:25.954000+00:00,/news/articles/cp8xppkrdd7o,"A US envoy has arrived in Israel to continue negotiations on a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, after reporting “additional progress” during a second day of talks in Beirut. Amos Hochstein, who has led the Biden administration’s efforts to end more than one year of conflict, was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid cautious optimism in Lebanon. In what was seen as a positive development, he returned to Beirut on Tuesday after the Lebanese government and Hezbollah accepted a US-drafted proposal, although with some comments. He unexpectedly extended his visit by a day for further discussions. After meeting Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has Hezbollah’s support to negotiate, Hochstein said he would go to Israel “to try to bring this to a close if we can”. Details of the ceasefire proposal remained unclear, but some of the earlier differences included the formation of a supervision mechanism and Israel’s demand to be able to strike Lebanon if a deal was violated, which had been rejected by Lebanon. Addressing foreign ambassadors in Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that, in any agreement, Israel “will have to maintain our freedom to act if there will be violations”, but he did not give details about what that would entail. Since the conflict intensified in late September, Lebanese authorities have said any deal should be based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution includes the removal of Hezbollah’s fighters and weapons in areas between the Blue Line - the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the boundary with Israel. Israel says that was never fully respected, while Lebanon says Israel has violated the resolution by carrying out military flights over the country. A potential deal would likely establish a timeline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the south of Lebanon and include the deployment there of thousands of additional troops of the Lebanese army. But questions remain about how the Lebanese troops would operate against Hezbollah, which is heavily armed and backed by Iran, amid fears this could exacerbate sectarian tensions. Israel’s stated goal in its war against Hezbollah is to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who have been displaced from communities in the country’s north because of the group’s attacks. In Lebanon, the conflict has killed more than 3,500 people and forced more than one million from their homes, Lebanese authorities say. It has also caused an estimated $8.5bn (£6.7bn) in economic damages and losses, according to the World Bank. Speaking in a pre-recorded televised speech, Hezbollah’s Secretary General Naim Qassem said the group had received the US proposal, clarified its reservations, and that it was allowing the talks to go ahead to see if they produced any results. Qassem, whose speech was broadcast shortly after Hochstein made his comments, said the conditions for a deal were a complete cessation of hostilities and the preservation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, and that Hezbollah was ready for a long fight. Israeli air strikes have destroyed large parts of Hezbollah’s infrastructure and killed many of its leaders, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah. But after the initial shock, the group has reorganised itself. It continues to carry out daily attacks on Israel, although not with the same intensity, and confront invading Israeli soldiers in Lebanon’s south. Amid the negotiations, Israel has stepped up its air campaign across Lebanon but, after three consecutive days of strikes on Beirut, there were no attacks on the capital during Hochstein’s visit.",US envoy in Israel after progress on Hezbollah ceasefire,US envoy in Israel after progress on Hezbollah ceasefire,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8xppkrdd7o,articles/article_3324.txt,results/article_3324.txt.json
3325,2024-10-31 14:12:36.780000+00:00,/news/articles/c14ln6kkkg7o,"Senior American officials have returned to the Middle East to try to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the negotiators had made ""good progress"" on Thursday on a potential deal. Brett McGurk, President Biden’s Middle East co-ordinator, and Amos Hochstein, who has led negotiations in the conflict with Hezbollah, are in Israel for talks with the country’s authorities, although it was not clear whether any progress could be made ahead of the US presidential election, next week. Since the conflict escalated five weeks ago, Israel has launched widespread air strikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion of areas near the border. At least 2,200 people have been killed in the country, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and 1.2 million displaced, mostly Shia Muslims, heightening sectarian tensions and adding pressure on public services that were already struggling after years of a severe economic crisis. The Israeli government says its goal is to change the security situation along the border and guarantee the return of around 60,000 residents who have been displaced because of Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and drone attacks. What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Where is fighting happening in Lebanon?How the US election could impact the Middle East On Wednesday, Israeli public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement, written by Washington and dated Saturday, for an initial 60-day ceasefire. Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the deal, and the Lebanese army would be deployed along the border. During the pause, Hezbollah would end its armed presence in the area. The objective is to pave the way for the full implementation of United Nations Resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. The text, among other things, called for the removal of all armed groups, including Hezbollah, from the area south of the Litani River, 30km (20 miles) north of the border. Only the UN peacekeeping force known as Unifil and the Lebanese army would be allowed there. Israel, however, distrustful that the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will be able to keep Hezbollah away from the border, reportedly wants to be given the right to strike the group if needed after the end of the war. This demand is likely to be rejected by the Lebanese authorities, who say there should be no changes to Resolution 1701. When asked about the document reported by Kan, White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said there were “many reports and drafts circulating” that “do not reflect the current state of negotiations”. He did not, however, respond to a question about whether that text was the basis for further talks. On Thursday, commenting on the negotiations, Secretary Blinken said there had been progress made on mutual understanding of the requirements of the resolution. ""It's important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,"" he said during a press conference. Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party which is armed and financially supported by Iran, faces domestic pressure for a deal, particularly from critics who say the group dragged Lebanon into a conflict which was not in the country’s interests. Israel’s bombardments have killed most of the Hezbollah leadership, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, and brought extensive destruction to areas of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group holds sway. The group started its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year, and has long said its attacks will continue unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. It is not clear whether it would be willing to change its position. On Wednesday, Naim Qassem gave his first speech as Hezbollah’s new secretary general, in which he said the group would continue with its war plan under his leadership, but that it could agree to a deal within certain terms. So far, he said, Israel had not presented any proposal that could be discussed. As he spoke, Israel launched heavy air strikes on the historic city of Baalbek, in the Bekaa Valley, in what could indicate an expansion of its military campaign against the group in a strategically important area near the border with Syria. Hours later, in an interview to Lebanon’s Al Jazeed television, Mr Mikati said he became “cautiously optimistic” after a phone call with Mr Hochstein, who had visited Lebanon last week, saying a ceasefire could be possible in the “coming hours or days”. It remained unclear, however, if any agreement could be reached before the US presidential election on Tuesday, with reports suggesting the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was waiting the outcome of the vote before deciding. Violence continued on Thursday, with rocket attacks by Hezbollah killing seven in Israel - the deadliest day in the country since the escalation in the conflict - while Israeli attacks killed six health workers in southern Lebanon. US officials are also trying to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

3326,2024-10-15 18:48:51.680000+00:00,/news/articles/c9wk0e8zey2o,"The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off. The letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties. It says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month. Israel is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country ""takes this matter seriously"" and intends to ""address the concerns raised"" with US counterparts. Israel has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid. On Monday, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said 30 lorries carrying aid from the World Food Programme had entered northern Gaza through the Erez crossing. That ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there. A UN official has said that Gaza is in a state of ""constant peak emergency"". Antoine Renard, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in the occupied Palestinian territories, told the AFP news agency people in the north of the territory were ""relying solely on assistance"" with practically no access to fresh food other than that provided by UN agencies. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, and the Israeli military has relied heavily on US-supplied aircraft, guided bombs, missiles and shells to fight the war against Hamas in Gaza over the past year. The US letter to the Israeli government - the contents of which have now been confirmed by the state department - was first reported by the Axios website. It is signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""We are now writing to underscore the US government’s deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,"" it says. It states that Israeli evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into the narrow, coastal al-Mawasi area where they are at “high risk of lethal contagion” due to extreme overcrowding, and that humanitarian organisations report that their survival needs cannot be met. ""We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments - together with increased lawlessness and looting - are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,"" it adds. The letter says Israel ""must, starting now and within 30 days"" act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, adding that failure may “have implications for US policy”. It cites US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid. It says Israel must ""surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza"" before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing people in al-Mawasi to move inland. It also calls on Israel to end the ""isolation of northern Gaza"" by reaffirming that there will be ""no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians"" from north to south. At a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the letter was ""a private diplomatic communication that we did not intend to make public"". ""Secretary [Blinken] along with Secretary Austin thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes they need to make again to see the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up,"" he said. Mr Miller declined to speculate on what consequences there might be for Israel if it did not boost humanitarian aid access. But he noted: ""Recipients of US military assistance do not arbitrarily deny or impede provisioning of US humanitarian assistance. That’s just the law and we of course will follow the law. But our hope is that Israel will make the changes that we have outlined. ""He also said the 30-day time limit was not linked to the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November, saying it was ""appropriate to give them time to work through the different issues"". Israel has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid or humanitarian assistance that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and blames UN agencies for failing to distribute supplies. It also accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. Before Israel’s ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, President Joe Biden suspended a single consignment of 2,000 and 500lb bombs for the first time as he tried to dissuade it from an all-out assault. But the president immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appeared to compare it to an ""arms embargo"". The suspension was partially lifted in July and has not been repeated. Earlier on Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that families in northern Gaza were ""facing unimaginable fear, loss of loved ones, confusion, and exhaustion"" because of the Israeli offensive that began 10 days ago. The Israeli military says it has sent tanks and troops back into the town of Jabalia and its urban refugee camp for a third time to root out Hamas fighters who have regrouped there. It has ordered residents of Jabalia, as well as neighbouring Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, to evacuate to the al-Mawasi ""humanitarian area"". The UN says about 50,000 people have fled to Gaza City and other parts of the north. But for many it is unsafe to leave their homes or they are unable to leave because they are sick or disabled. Khalid, a resident of Jabalia whose accounts of the past year are featured in a new BBC documentary, said in a voice note that he and his family had been living in fear for a week. ""We were told to go to the south, but we couldn’t because the Israeli army has surrounded the area, either with dirt barricades or using quadcopter drones. We can’t move, it’s too difficult. """"At the same time, because of the intense bombing we’re living in constant terror. My daughter has become sick and she has a fever. Her entire body is shaking in fear because of the sound of the bombings and I don’t know what to do with her. I can’t even take her to the hospital,"" he added. Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of 42 people killed by Israeli air and artillery strikes in Jabalia and neighbouring areas on Tuesday. They reportedly included 11 members of the same family, nearly all of them women and children, whose home was destroyed in an air strike overnight. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that its troops had killed “dozens of terrorists” in the Jabalia area over the previous day. On Monday, Israeli human rights groups warned of what they called “alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement the Generals’ Plan”, external, echoing widespread Palestinian concerns. The controversial plan calls for the forcible transfer of all civilians in the north followed by a siege of the Hamas fighters remaining there to force their surrender and the release of Israeli hostages. The Israeli military denies it is being implemented, saying it is only “getting civilians out of harm's way”. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,340 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",US gives Israel 30 days to boost Gaza aid or risk cut to military support,US gives Israel 30 days to boost Gaza aid or risk cut to military support,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wk0e8zey2o,articles/article_3326.txt,results/article_3326.txt.json

Officials said on Tuesday that Israel has taken a number of steps to address its demands to surge supplies into Gaza, but added that more progress must be made. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel cited the opening of a new land crossing, and deliveries resuming in the north - although he did not say any had entered the besieged Jabalia refugee camp. Despite the US claims, the UN has warned that the amount of aid getting into Gaza is at its lowest level in a year.  A UN-backed report recently warned that there was an imminent likelihood of famine in northern Gaza, where hardly any aid has entered in the past month. Joyce Msuya, the United Nations acting under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said international crimes were being committed in Gaza. Ms Msuya briefed council members at the United Nations on Tuesday, reporting that Israeli authorities were blocking humanitarian assistance from entering North Gaza, where fighting continues. She said 75,000 people remain there with dwindling supplies. Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave Israel 30 days to ensure more aid trucks reached Gaza daily. That deadline expired on Tuesday. A letter sent to the Israeli government demanded the country end the isolation of the besieged north, where aid groups warn that civilians are being starved amid Israel’s military offensive. A group of eight humanitarian aid agencies said conditions had actually deteriorated since the letter was sent. But the US reaction on Tuesday indicates that Washington will continue to supply weapons to its ally, despite growing warnings from aid groups about civilians being killed and displaced by Israel’s assault on the north. The Israeli military, however, said it has been routing a Hamas resurgence in the region. Israel says it has substantially increased the amount of aid getting into Gaza, and accuses aid agencies of failing adequately to distribute it. In Beit Hanoun, which was besieged for more than a month, Ms Msuya said food and water reached shelters Monday only for Israeli soldiers to forcibly displace people from those areas Tuesday. Ilze Kehris, assistant secretary general for human rights at the UN, said the pattern and frequency of Israel's attacks suggest systematic targeting of civilians.  Much of the death and destruction was caused by US weapons, given to Israel in order the help the fight Hamas. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas after the group's attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead; 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",US says Israel hasn't breached its law against blocking aid in Gaza,US says Israel hasn't breached its law against blocking aid in Gaza,"israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgej83z93qo,articles/article_3328.txt,results/article_3328.txt.json

On Tuesday, Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council in New York the US wanted to ""deter and defend against any future attack and avoid regional conflict"". There are fears Iran could retaliate against Israel following July's assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran - something Israel has not said it was behind. US President Joe Biden suggested reaching a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could help deter Iran from launching an attack on Israel. ""That's my expectation but we'll see,"" he said when asked by a reporter on Tuesday. ""We'll see what Iran does and we'll see what happens if there's any attack, but I'm not giving up,"" he said, while exiting his plane during a visit to New Orleans, Louisiana. A new round of ceasefire talks is scheduled to take place in either Doha or Cairo on Thursday. But a Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmad Abdul Hadi, has said Hamas will not take part in the talks, according to reports by the New York Times and Sky News. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed plans to travel to the Middle East on Tuesday to participate in negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire deal. International mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been pushing for an agreement that would see Israeli hostages released to their families in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Meanwhile, Washington has also approved new arms sales worth $20bn (£15.5bn) to Israel. The state department said Israel would buy 50 F-15 fighter jets, as well as 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 mortar cartridges and new military cargo vehicles. The aircraft will begin to be delivered in 2029. At the Security Council meeting in New York, Ms Thomas-Greenfield called for a ceasefire deal to be finalised. ""A broader regional conflict is not inevitable,"" she said. ""The United States’ overall goal remains to turn the temperature down in the region, deter and defend against any future attacks, and avoid regional conflict,"" she added. ""That starts with finalising a deal for an immediate ceasefire with hostage release in Gaza. We need to get this over the finish line. ""But Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, accused the Security Council of not doing enough to stop Israel's military operation in Gaza. ""Wake up. Stop finding excuses. Stop imagining that you can reason with the Israeli government so it stops killing civilians by the thousands, imposing famine, torturing prisoners, colonising and annexing our land, all while you appeal to them, call on them, demand them to stop,"" Mr Mansour said. Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan said the Israeli military took every possible measure to minimise collateral damage and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. He also criticised the Security Council for not condemning the actions of Iran. ""As we speak here now, millions of Israelis are preparing for a direct Iranian attack, just as they did in April. Iran's aggression threatens the entire region with war. ""Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people have also been killed in the almost daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the conflict. Amid a flurry of international diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, Iran on Monday dismissed calls from the UK and other Western countries to refrain from retaliation against Israel for the killing of Haniyeh. Israel, which did not say it was involved in Haniyeh’s assassination, has meanwhile put its military on its highest alert level.

US President Joe Biden said the US ""actively"" supported Israel's defence at his direction. He said he had spent the morning in the Situation Room - the White House hub for handling serious national security issues. The Israeli military said about 180 missiles were fired at Israel, most of which were intercepted. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has defended the attack, calling it a ""decisive"" response ""in defence of Iranian interests and citizens"". In a Pentagon press briefing on Tuesday, Maj Gen Patrick Ryder said two US Navy destroyers fired the interceptors at the missiles, which the US believed were all launched from Iran. He did not confirm whether they hit any of the Iranian missiles used in the attack - adding that this information was yet to be determined. Iran launched around 180 missiles towards Israel, the Israeli military said. That would make it slightly larger than a barrage in April when Tehran launched about 110 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles fired towards Israel. Maj Gen Ryder added that the Pentagon was not aware of any warning for the attack. President Biden said the US was ""fully supportive"" of Israel after Wednesday's assault. ""Today, at my direction, the United States military actively supported the defence of Israel, and we're still assessing the impact,"" he said. ""But based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. And this is testament to the Israeli military capability and the US military. ""Asked by reporters what the response towards Iran would be, Biden said: ""That's in active discussion right now. That remains to be seen. ""He said he would be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his message ""would depend on what we finally conclude is needed"". The region is now well into a further sharp cycle of escalation, precisely the scenario Biden has spent months trying to avert - attempting to stem the Gaza war engulfing the rest of the region, while keeping up an almost continuous supply of arms to Israel. Earlier, White House national security spokesman Jake Sullivan described Iran's attack as a ""significant escalation"". He told reporters: ""We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case. ""Mr Sullivan did not specify what such consequences might be, but he did not urge restraint by Israel as the US did after April's attack by Iran. US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington had attempted to use both deterrence and diplomacy to de-escalate the region. Pressed by the BBC on whether it was still taking this approach when working with the Israelis on the response to Iran, he said of course - they were always using both deterrence and diplomacy. Iran's armed forces warned against any direct military intervention in support of Israel. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement that the attacks were in response to Israel's killing of a top IRGC commander and leaders of Iran-backed militias in the region. It mentioned the killings of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoshan in Lebanon last weekend. It also referred to the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin also said an aircraft carrier which was already heading to the area would sail there more quickly. The move comes in response to fears of a wider regional conflict, after the recent assassination of senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. It signals the US's determination to help defend Israel from any attack by Iran - with Mr Austin saying US would ""take every possible step"" to defend its ally. Iran is being closely watched for any indication of how and when it might respond to the assassination of Hamas's top political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on 31 July. The Iranians blamed Israel for the assassination of Mr Haniyeh on their soil, and have vowed to punish it. Israel has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind it. In a statement on Sunday,, external the Pentagon said Mr Austin had sent the the USS Georgia guided missile submarine to the region. The submarine can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which are used to strike land targets. It had also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which is carrying F-35C fighter jets, to accelerate its journey there. The ship was already on its way to replace another US ship in the region. Iran keeps region guessing as it mulls revenge attackHamas says Gaza truce talks must be based on Biden planIt remains unclear what Iran could be planning to do. Meanwhile, another possible attack on Israel could come from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon. The group has vowed to respond to the killing by Israel of senior commander Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before Mr Haniyeh’s assassination, in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Professor Mehran Kamrava, from Georgetown University in Qatar, said the US publicly sending a submarine was ""meant as a deterrence against Iran and Hezbollah"". But he suggested that in private, ""there might be some indication that Iran is actually up to something and is going to strike"". Several passenger airlines have cancelled flights to airports in the region due to the perceived threat. German airline Lufthansa said on Monday it was suspending flights to Tel Aviv in Israel, Lebanon's capital city Beirut, the Jordanian capital Amman, Erbil in Iraq, and the Iranian capital, Tehran, until 21 August ""based on its current security analysis"". Swiss Air has also cancelled its flights scheduled to travel to Tel Aviv and Beirut over the same period. Meanwhile, Air France extended its suspension of flights to Beirut - which began on 29 July - through to Wednesday, according to the AFP news agency. Other airlines, including AirBaltic and EasyJet, have previously said they were suspending flights to the region. When Iran previously launched an attack on Israel following a strike on its consulate in Syria in April, it did so using hundreds of aerial drones and missiles. The Biden administration believes a ceasefire in Gaza that frees Israeli hostages would be the best way to calm tensions in the region, and has called for talks to resume on Thursday. But on Sunday night, Hamas responded to US efforts to revive the ceasefire talks by saying Israel should be forced to implement the deal already on the table. Hamas said that any resumption of ceasefire talks about the conflict in Gaza should be based on its previous position rather than holding new rounds of negotiations. However its statement indicated an agreement in principle to participate. Washington has previously blamed Hamas for the failure of negotiations. But Israeli press reports say the US increasingly sees Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as partly responsible – because he is accused of appeasing far-right members of his coalition who are opposed to a deal. Last week, for the first time the White House openly criticised one of these coalition leaders, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich. Mr Smotrich had urged Israel to reject the US push for ceasefire talks, saying it would be a surrender to Hamas. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Mr Smotrich was ""dead wrong"" and accused him of making false claims. Meanwhile the leaders of the UK, France and Germany echoed calls for ceasefire talks to resume. ""We agree that there can be no further delay,"" said the statement from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was ""ironclad"". Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh. The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented. Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war. His death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. A Pentagon statement said the new deployments would ""improve US force protection. . . increase support for the defence of Israel, and . . . ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies"". The deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said. On Tel Aviv’s seafront, the mood appears relaxed with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas. But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full- scale war. Israel is on high alert. Several international airlines have suspended flights to the country. Meanwhile, Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on communication infrastructure. Earlier on Saturday, Israeli forces killed a Hamas operative in the West Bank. Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed in strikes on Gaza in the last 24 hours - a reminder that Israel’s war in the region continues even as diplomats scramble to prevent its escalation. The US military has stepped-up deployments before, on 13 April when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired. Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered ""crushing blows"" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut. He warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead. . . we have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable. ""I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal,"" Singh said. An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday. Hamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The circumstances surrounding Haniyeh's death are, as yet, still unclear. On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph, external reported that Iranian agents hired by Israel's Mossad spy agency had planted bombs in a building where Haniyeh was staying. The newspaper says that two agents placed bombs in three rooms of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp guesthouse in Tehran, which were detonated from abroad. An earlier report by the New York Times, external said that the bombs had been snuck into the building two months earlier.

3333,2024-11-27 14:28:13.106000+00:00,/news/articles/c0j8063plvdo,"President Joe Biden has said the US will make another push with regional powers for a ceasefire in Gaza, involving the release of hostages and the removal of Hamas from power. His remarks on X come just hours after a ceasefire came into force in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, ending nearly 14 months of conflict. Hamas said it hoped for a similar deal in Gaza but continues to reject Israel's demands, which it perceives as surrender. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Jeremy Bowen: Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for Middle EastDisplaced Lebanese head for homes as fragile truce appears to holdWhat we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal More than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. ""Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power,"" Biden said on X. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden had agreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right before the announcement of the Lebanon ceasefire to try again for a Gaza agreement, which negotiators have sought unsuccessfully for months. The US and its Arab allies used to say that a ceasefire in Gaza would end the conflict with Hezbollah. Now they are hoping for the reverse.  The argument goes that the truce in Lebanon shows compromises are possible and that Hamas may now feel more isolated, putting pressure on it to agree to concessions. However, the goals of the Israeli government in Lebanon were always more limited than those in Gaza, where it has failed to agree a post-war plan.  Qatar recently suspended its efforts to help mediate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Palestinian territory until both sides shifted their positions.  Hamas insists on ending the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, while Israel remains determined to destroy Hamas. Netanyahu's political survival is also bound up with Gaza.  His far-right coalition partners aspire to rebuild Jewish settlements there and have threatened to collapse the government if Israel makes a “reckless” agreement to stop the fighting.  Netanyahu also worries that a ceasefire could open the way to a commission of inquiry into Israel’s failure to prevent the 7 October attacks, which would be very damaging for him. Hamas reacted positively to the Lebanon ceasefire, and said it was ready to consider a truce in Gaza. “We appreciate the steadfastness of the brotherly Lebanese people, and their constant solidarity with the Palestinian people,” Hamas leader Basem Naim told the BBC. ""We express our commitment to cooperate with any efforts to stop the fire in Gaza, and we are concerned with stopping the aggression against our people. ""The organisation has faced significant challenges, including an inability to convene its leadership since the killing of Yahya Sinwar by Israel. Its leaders are now scattered across Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and disconnected from those managing the hostages held in Gaza. These hostages appear to be Hamas’s remaining leverage, as the group’s capacity to fight Israel has been very limited, and its popularity has significantly declined in Gaza. Amos Hochstein, the US envoy who negotiated the ceasefire in Lebanon, told BBC Newshour he was hopeful the deal could pave the way to a ceasefire in Gaza and even for the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. ""I know I sound crazy, but then again people thought I sounded crazy when I said I thought I could get a deal in Lebanon,"" he said. ""I read many articles [about] how I was in fantasy-land. ""Will it happen? I don't know, but we have an opportunity and I think that's why this deal is so important. ""It's not just about Lebanon. It's a key that unlocks potentially an even broader door. ""Despite insisting on three conditions - an Israeli withdrawal, a permanent ceasefire and the reconstruction of Gaza - Hamas has indicated to mediators on many occasions its willingness to make substantial concessions. For now, Hamas remains unwilling to agree to terms it perceives as surrender, but it has little room for manoeuvre in the negotiations, as the gap between the two sides has become deeper and the sound of the guns will remain louder. Meanwhile, on Gaza's streets, the ceasefire has raised some concerns. ""We were overjoyed by the cessation of the war in Lebanon, and we also hope for the same here in the Gaza Strip,"" one man in Khan Younis told Gaza Today. ""However, at the same time, we have concerns that the occupation army might once again intensify its raids in Gaza and that its military forces might return from Lebanon to Gaza. ""“We don’t want anyone to experience what we’ve gone through here in Gaza,"" another man said. ""We don’t want to see children killed, women trapped under rubble, or the recurring scenes of bloodshed in Lebanon that we have witnessed here. ""On the other hand, I believe the Israeli army will focus its raids on Gaza. "" While the outgoing Biden administration is making a last-ditch effort to work on a Gaza truce deal, it is not clear how much of a priority this will be when President Trump takes office.  Trump did, however, express an interest in ending the fighting in Lebanon, in line with pledges he made to Lebanese-American voters during his election campaign. Another factor to bear in mind is that ending the war with Hezbollah relieves pressure on Israel’s military, which has been stretched by conflicts raging in the north and south.  Contrary to the idea that the ceasefire in Lebanon could lead to one with Hamas, some defence analysts now argue that it could in fact make it more possible for Israel to continue fighting in Gaza.",US to start immediately on fresh push for Gaza ceasefire,US to start immediately on fresh push for Gaza ceasefire,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0j8063plvdo,articles/article_3333.txt,results/article_3333.txt.json
3334,2024-10-23 03:22:22.326000+00:00,/news/articles/cy898ld3yp8o,"Antony Blinken has told Israeli leaders that “much more needs to be done” to get humanitarian aid to civilians in besieged northern Gaza, raising possible consequences in US law if action isn’t taken, a senior Biden administration official says. On Tuesday, the US secretary of state met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and senior military officials in a series of meetings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The meetings are part of a regional tour that Washington sees as a chance to revive diplomacy after Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week. The account of Blinken’s face-to-face message to the Israelis comes despite mounting criticism that the US has failed to stem the rate at which civilians have been killed in Gaza because it has been unwilling to use its supplying of weapons to Israel as  leverage. Washington has consistently rejected the criticism. The official said Blinken also pressed the Israeli leadership over reports that its military has been implementing a so-called “generals’ plan” in northern Gaza - a tactic described as using mass forced displacement of civilians and a surrender-or-starve tactic against all who remain. Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for warWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?The official said the Israelis told them the tactic was “absolutely not” their policy, to which the Americans responded that their Israeli counterparts then needed to make this clearer publicly. Israel has said its offensive in northern Gaza is to rout a Hamas resurgence. Blinken’s apparent warning on humanitarian aid followed his letter last week, co-signed by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, which gave the Israeli government 30 days to surge aid into the northern Gaza Strip or risk having some military assistance cut off. “There was extended conversation about this,” the senior State Department official said. They added: “The steps that have [been] taken thus far have not been sufficient and we made that clear today, that we do need to see more. ” “We have seen some initial progress. We heard more from Minister Gallant in detail about… steps that he is overseeing to be responsive to it, but… both with the prime minister, Minister Dermer and with Minister Gallant, this was a central part of the discussion,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Aid groups have warned that civilians in northern Gaza risk starvation amid Israel’s military siege. Israel says its offensive there is focused on Hamas fighters, while the US has warned it not to try to forcibly displace residents to the south of Gaza, where 1.7 million civilians are crammed into a dangerously overcrowded area at “lethal risk” of disease. Pressed on whether Blinken warned the Israelis verbally about repercussions if Israel didn’t heed its demands, the official said Blinken “made clear it has implications under our law and policy, [and] what those actions need to be”. A statement issued by Netanyahu’s office after the meeting made no mention of humanitarian assistance. It stressed the “Iranian threat” against Israel and the need for the US and Israel to “unite” against it. The statement also said Blinken had expressed America’s “deep shock” over what Israel says was an Iranian assassination attempt against Netanyahu via a Hezbollah drone strike on his private residence at the weekend. It said Blinken had characterised the event as “an exceptionally extreme incident”.  Asked whether this account was accurate, the US official said Blinken “expressed concern that it was a very serious incident… ‘Exceptional and extreme’ is not language that he would typically use. ” The official added the US had no assessment either way over the claim of Iranian involvement. The discrepancy in the characterisation of their conversation comes with Israel poised to carry out a retaliatory strike against Iran for its 1 October ballistic missile attack on Israel. That had followed Israel’s recent assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The US is attempting to get Israel to dial down the scale of its response for fear of further regional escalation. The US official also said Blinken discussed the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon as part of a “diplomatic push” the Americans are making to de-escalate the fighting, but didn’t provide any update on whether this had made progress.",US top diplomat issues warning to Israel over Gaza aid,US top diplomat issues warning to Israel over Gaza aid,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy898ld3yp8o,articles/article_3334.txt,results/article_3334.txt.json

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza ""must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released"". Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document ""abandoned"" the necessity for there to be ""a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages"". Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it ""deeply regretted"" the move. The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected. This group proposed the draft resolution which also ""rejected any effort to starve Palestinians"". The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were ""facing diminishing conditions for survival"" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days. Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza. The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals. Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a ""dangerous message"" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that ""there's no need to come back to the negotiating table"". Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution ""was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed"". ""Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto,"" he added. Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being ""directly responsible"" for Israel's ""genocidal war"" in Gaza. Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: ""Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"" France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire. The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages. But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors. Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of ""once again"" using its veto power ""to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza"". Israel rejects the accusations. The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

But the UN says only 10% of that number have crossed each day on average since then. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said it was going “above and beyond its humanitarian obligations” and blamed Hamas. Mr Danon also rejected international criticism of the Israeli parliament’s decision to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from working in Israel. Israel's allies have warned that Unrwa plays a critical role in delivering humanitarian assistance to Gaza, where it is the largest humanitarian organisation on the ground. In a briefing to the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday, UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he had witnessed a “horrific humanitarian nightmare” during a recent visit to Gaza. He said the north of the Palestinian territory had received virtually no humanitarian assistance since the start of October, when the Israeli military began a ground offensive in the Jabalia area that it said was aimed at stopping Hamas fighters from regrouping there. The operation has killed scores of Palestinians, caused mass displacement and led to the closure of essential services, including water wells and medical facilities. The US ambassador said the reports of children going days without food in Jabalia had made her think about how she had seen a girl die of starvation almost three decades ago. Ms Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration had made clear to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel must address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza immediately and that the US “rejects any Israeli efforts to starve Palestinians in Jabalia, or anywhere else”. “The US has stated clearly that Israel must allow food, medicine and other supplies into all of Gaza - especially the north, and especially as winter sets in - and protect the workers distributing it,” she added. Mr Danon told the Council that Israel had been “hard at work delivering humanitarian aid”. “The problem isn’t the flow of aid. It is Hamas, which hijacks supplies, storing or selling them to fuel their terror machine while Gaza’s civilians are neglected. Israel remains committed to working with our partners to deliver aid to those in need,” he added. On 13 October, the Biden administration told Mr Netanyahu’s government that Israel must act within 30 days on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, citing US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid. They included enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all Israeli-controlled crossings with Gaza and ending the “isolation” of the north immediately. According to data published Unrwa, external, only 852 aid lorries have crossed into Gaza this month, compared with about 3,000 lorries in September. A total of 502 have entered since the letter, with an average of 35 lorries crossing each day between 14 and 29 October. Israel’s own data, meanwhile, says a total of 1,386 lorries have crossed between 1 and 28 October, external - a daily average of 49. It says there are also 670 lorry loads of aid awaiting collection from inside Gaza. Ms Thomas-Greenfield also expressed US concern about the two laws adopted by Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, forbidding Israeli state officials from contact with Unrwa and prohibiting Unrwa operations in Israel and annexed East Jerusalem in three months’ time. “We know that right now, there is no alternative to Unrwa when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza. Therefore, we have concerns about this legislation being implemented,"" she said. Mr Danon accused Unrwa of being ""a terrorist front camouflaged as a humanitarian agency"", citing the involvement of a handful of its thousands of staff in the 7 October attacks on Israel. Unrwa insists it is impartial and that the laws breach the UN charter and Israel’s obligations under international law. On Monday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his Israeli counterpart had floated the possibility of delayed implementation of the legislation during a call at the weekend. “When I raised this issue with Foreign Minister [Israel] Katz yesterday, he was at pains to explain that, although the Knesset could pass its bill today, that does not mean that it has to be implemented,” Mr Lammy told the UK Parliament. But in an unusual statement sent to the BBC on Wednesday, the Israeli foreign ministry contradicted Mr Lammy’s account. ""In general, we do not refer to the content of diplomatic talks. Nevertheless, and in order to remove any doubts, it should be clarified that the description of Foreign Minister Katz's remarks is not true and does not reflect what was said in the conversation,” it said. “The foreign minister is, of course, committed to the implementation of the Knesset's legislation as well as to Israel’s international humanitarian obligations.

The Pentagon said it used aircraft and warships to launch the attacks in order ""to protect freedom of navigation"". Several explosions were reported in some of Yemen’s main cities, including the capital Sanaa. Since November, the Houthis have launched attacks on around 100 ships in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels. The rebel group says the attacks are retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Central Command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, said the attacks targeted weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Houthis. Houthi-aligned media say the Yemeni capital of Sanaa was among cities hit. On Monday, the Houthis said they had shot down a US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen. The US military acknowledged losing an unmanned aircraft. Last week the Pentagon said the Houthis had launched ""a complex attack"" on US Navy ships in the region, though all of the weapons launched were shot down. Sanaa has had a respite from bombing in the past two years since fighting between the warring parties in Yemen largely subsided. As well as the attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired several missiles and drones at Israel directly. In July a drone launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and injuring 10. Last month, the group fired several missiles at Israel, including one that targeted Israel's main airport. Both times Israel responded by attacking sites in Yemen. Earlier this year, the US, UK and 12 other nations launched Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect Red Sea shipping lanes against the Houthis.

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who had joint nationality, was taking part in a protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita near Nablus. According to local media reports, Ms Eygi was shot by Israeli troops.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was ""looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area"". A fellow protester told the BBC Friday's demonstration was Ms Eygi's first time attending a protest with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken deplored the ""tragic loss"", while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded the Israeli action ""barbaric"". Turkey's foreign ministry said Ms Eygi was ""killed by Israeli occupation soldiers in the city of Nablus"". The White House did not ascribe blame, but called on Israel to investigate. Earlier, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington was ""urgently gathering more information about the circumstances of her death"". Ms Eygi was born in Antalya, as reported by Turkish media. The dual-national was rushed to a hospital in Nablus and later pronounced dead. Dr Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital where Ms Eygi was admitted, confirmed that a US citizen in her mid-20s had died from a ""gunshot in the head"". In a statement, the IDF said: ""Today (Friday), during Israeli security forces activity adjacent to the area of Beita, the forces responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. ""The IDF is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review. ""Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli activist who was at the same protest as Ms Eygi, said he had heard ""two separate shots of live ammunition, shot one after the other. . . and then I heard another shot"". ""I found her lying on the ground, beside the tree, bleeding from her head,"" Mr Pollak told AFP news agency, as he showed blood on the hand he used to stop Ms Eygi's head from bleeding. ""I took her pulse, she had a very weak pulse, we called the ambulance. ""From there we evacuated her to the village's medical centre, where the doctor came into the ambulance and continued into the hospital, where they tried to resuscitate her but failed. ""Mr Pollak said the killing was ""now receiving the light of day because she is an American citizen"". In an interview with the BBC's Newshour programme, Mr Pollak was asked about the IDF's statement, where the Israeli military said security forces had been responding to ""a main instigator who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them"". Mr Pollak said there had been clashes but he felt that soldiers had been ""under no threat"". He also said that where Ms Eygi was shot had been a ""separate incident at a separate place"", adding that there had been ""no stone throwing"" where she had been. Israeli forces withdrew from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Friday, following a major nine-day operation there. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - in that time. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. In the past 50 years, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.",US-Turkish protester killed in West Bank as Israeli forces opened fire,US-Turkish protester killed in West Bank as Israeli forces opened fire,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx6771gyqzo,articles/article_3339.txt,results/article_3339.txt.json
3340,2024-11-20 12:35:58.893000+00:00,/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo,"Palestinians are ""facing diminishing conditions for survival"" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days, the United Nations has warned. The UN said all its attempts to support the estimated 65,000 to 75,000 people in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalia this month had been denied or impeded, forcing bakeries and kitchens to shut down. Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza. The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals. Hundreds of people have been killed and between 100,000 and 130,000 others have been displaced to Gaza City, where the UN has said essential resources like shelter, water and healthcare are severely limited. Meanwhile, the US vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution that demanded an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The 14 other Security Council members voted in favour, but the US said the text did not explicitly call for the immediate release of the hostages being held by Hamas as part of a ceasefire. The resolution ""demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"". Israel said the text was a ""resolution for appeasement"" of Hamas, but France said the resolution ""very firmly"" required the hostages' release. UN agencies had planned 31 missions to the besieged areas of North Gaza governorate between 1 and 18 November, according to the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Twenty-seven were rejected by Israeli authorities and the other four were severely impeded, meaning they were prevented from accomplishing all the work they set out to do. ""This is happening when the IPC Famine Review Committee said just 11 days ago that parts of northern Gaza face an imminent risk of famine - and that immediate action is needed in days, not weeks,"" UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York. ""The result is that bakeries and kitchens in North Gaza governorate have shut down, nutrition support [for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women] has been suspended, and the refuelling of water and sanitation facilities has been completely blocked. ""Mr Dujarric said access to the three barely functional hospitals there also remained severely restricted, amid what he called ""desperate shortages"" of medical supplies and fuel. On Sunday, a World Health Organisation-led mission to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia was able to deliver 10,000 litres of fuel and transfer 17 patients, three unaccompanied children and 22 caregivers to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. However, Mr Dujarric said the aid workers were forced to offload all the food supplies and some of the medical supplies they were transporting at an Israeli military checkpoint before reaching the hospital. The director of Kamal Adwan, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, warned on Wednesday that the situation there was becoming ""even more catastrophic"". Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry cited him as saying that the hospital had 85 patients receiving ""the minimum level of healthcare"" and that it needed children’s food and infant formula to treat an increasing number of malnutrition cases. Since Tuesday, 17 children had arrived at the emergency room showing signs of malnutrition and an elderly man had died due to severe dehydration, he added. There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). But data from the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, Cogat, said 472 aid lorries had entered northern Gaza via the Erez West crossing as of 17 November, without specifying whether any of that aid was allowed into the besieged areas. Cogat also said it was continuing to work with international partners to “facilitate broad humanitarian responses for the civilian population in Gaza"". On Monday, a boy from Beit Lahia told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme that he and his family had fled to Gaza City after the Israeli military dropped leaflets from a quadcopter, ordering their immediate evacuation. ""The road from Beit Lahia to Gaza [City] was rough and bumpy with no transport available for us. When we arrived, we didn’t find anything. . . neither food nor drink. We headed to the schools, but there was no space left because the number of displaced. . . was huge,"" he said. ""As a result, we were thrown into the streets and didn’t know where to go. We are six families living in the streets, sitting on sand, dirt and debris. ”The IDF said in a statement on Monday that its forces had killed ""dozens of terrorists in close-quarters encounters and through targeted strikes"" in the Beit Lahia area over the past week. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told AFP news agency that a drone had killed two people, including a 15-year-old girl, at a school sheltering displaced families in Beit Lahia. The agency's first responders had also recovered the bodies of seven people killed in an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia, he added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.","Virtually no aid has reached besieged north Gaza in 40 days, UN says","Virtually no aid has reached besieged north Gaza in 40 days, UN says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo,articles/article_3340.txt,results/article_3340.txt.json
3341,2024-09-03 12:28:57.951000+00:00,/news/articles/cy8xwxjy4y7o,"The World Health Organization (WHO) says polio vaccinations of children in central Gaza have ""surpassed the target"" in the first two days of its immunisation campaign. Dr Rik Peeperkorn, the UN agency's representative in the Palestinian territories, said 161,030 children under the age of 10 were vaccinated on Sunday and Monday - above the projection of 156,500. The difference was probably the result of an underestimate of the population crowded into the area, he explained. Israel and Hamas agreed to a series of localised pauses in the fighting to allow health workers to administer vaccines after Gaza's first confirmed case of polio in 25 years left a 10-month-old partially paralysed last month. The pauses are taking effect between 06:00 and 15:00 local time in three separate stages across central, southern and northern parts of Gaza. The first three-day stage began in Deir al-Balah governorate on Sunday. It will shift to the southern governorates of Rafah and Khan Younis on Thursday and then move to North Gaza and Gaza City. Dr Peeperkorn said the pauses had been ""going well"" until now. But there were still ""10 days to go at least"" for the first round of the vaccination campaign, he said, while a second round to repeat the immunisations will start in four weeks. He said some children were believed to be living outside the agreed zone for the pauses in the south and that negotiations were continuing in order to allow health workers to reach them. The aim is to vaccinate a total of 640,000 children. ""We need to cover a minimum of 90% of those children to stop the transmission within Gaza and to avoid polio spread, international spread of polio to surrounding countries,"" Dr Peeperkorn said. Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. Humanitarian groups have blamed the re-emergence of polio in Gaza on disruption to child vaccination programmes as well as massive damage to water and sanitation systems caused by the war. The mother of the partially paralysed baby, Abdulrahman Abu Judyan, told the BBC last week that her son was supposed to receive routine vaccinations on 7 October - the day Hamas attacked Israel and triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza. “I feel a lot of guilt that he didn’t get the vaccination. But I couldn’t give it to him because of our circumstances,” Niveen said. She desperately hoped her son could be taken outside Gaza for treatment. “He wants to live and walk like other children,” she said.",WHO exceeds target for Gaza polio vaccinations as campaign continues,WHO exceeds target for Gaza polio vaccinations as campaign continues,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy8xwxjy4y7o,articles/article_3341.txt,results/article_3341.txt.json

Willem-Alexander said ""our history has taught us how intimidation goes from bad to worse,"" adding that the country could not ignore ""antisemitic behaviour"". Youths on scooters had criss-crossed the Dutch capital in ""hit-and-run"" attacks on Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters who were visiting Amsterdam for a Europa League match, authorities said. Police said five people were treated in hospital and others suffered minor injuries. At least 62 people have been arrested. ""My heart goes out to the victims and to their families here and in Israel as well,"" Amsterdam's Mayor Femke Halsema told a press conference on Friday. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof flew back early from a summit of EU leaders in Budapest where he said he had been following developments with horror.  ""The perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted,"" he promised. The violence on Thursday night was condemned by leaders across Europe, the US and Israel. For many, it was especially shocking coming on the eve of commemorations marking Kristallnacht, the 1938 Nazi pogroms against German Jews. Three-quarters of Jewish people in the Netherlands were murdered during the Holocaust in World War Two. Israeli fans describe violence in AmsterdamAre you in Amsterdam? Please share your experiences here.  The king alluded to that history, saying: ""Jews must feel safe in the Netherlands, everywhere and at all times. We put our arms around them and will not let them go. ”US President Joe Biden said the attacks ""echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted"". There had already been trouble and some arrests the night before Thursday's match, involving Maccabi fans as well as pro-Palestinian protesters. Police chief Peter Holla confirmed there had been incidents ""on both sides"". Israeli supporters had removed a Palestinian flag from a wall and set it alight and attacked a taxi, although there had been no further trouble until the following night, he said. There were also reports of supporters setting off fireworks. One unverified video showed fans going down an escalator chanting anti-Arab slogans. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned ""anti-Arab chants"" and an ""attack on the Palestinian flag,"" calling on the Dutch government to ""protect Palestinians and Arabs"" living in the Netherlands. The national co-ordinator for combating antisemitism in the Netherlands said a line had been crossed and the ""readiness to commit such violence was disgusting"". Mayor Halsema said Dutch counter-terror co-ordinator NCTV had not flagged any concrete threat about the game itself as there was no animosity between the fans of the two clubs. There was no trouble at the game in which Ajax inflicted a heavy 5-0 defeat on the visiting team. But the unrest spiralled out of control soon afterwards. Halsema spoke of fans being ""attacked, abused and pelted with fireworks"" as they walked from the Johan Cruyff Arena to the centre of Amsterdam. Police initially said it was unclear who had taken part in the riots, although the mayor later spoke of young men on scooters. She was careful not to give details about the ethnic backgrounds of those involved in the attack, emphasising that it was part of the police investigation. Several videos circulated on social media, with one showing a man being kicked and beaten on the ground and another showing someone being run over. In some unverified videos, people could be heard shouting pro-Palestinian slogans. Two British visitors said they came under attack as they tried to help an Israeli beaten up by people on mopeds. Jacob, 33, told the BBC he saw ""10 people stamping and kicking"" the man, and that they had seen ""lots of little gangs chasing people"". Asked whether locals had been provoked by a Palestinian flag being torn down in the city, the mayor said what had happened in the centre of her city had nothing to do with protests about the situation in the Middle East. ""I am deeply ashamed of the behaviour that unfolded,"" Halsema told reporters. ""On Telegram [messaging] groups people talked of going to hunt down Jews. It's so terrible I can't find the words for it. ""In a statement, Telegram said it had closed a group chat on the platform which ""may have been linked to the disturbance"". The company said it did not tolerate ""calls to violence"" and would cooperate with the Dutch authorities. The mayor confirmed reports that taxi drivers had been involved in the attacks, after the head of the Netherlands' Central Jewish Committee (CJO) said they had ""moved in groups and cornered their targets"". Israeli airline El Al said it was operating free ""rescue flights"" to Amsterdam to bring passengers back to Israel. On Friday, those flights started arriving back at Israel's Ben Gurion airport, where passengers were swarmed by reporters in the arrival hall and asked to share their experiences of the violence. Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoke of a ""pogrom"" against Maccabi fans and Israeli citizens. Herzog said on X that he trusted the Dutch authorities would act immediately to ""protect, locate and rescue all Israelis and Jews under attack"". The violence in Amsterdam has raised questions about security for Israeli fans elsewhere in Europe. Israel's national security council had urged fans to avoid a basketball game in the Italian city of Bologna on Friday due to the risk of ""copycat actions"", though there were no reports of violence following the EuroLeague fixture. According to Italian media, Bologna's police chief assigned a special escort to the Israeli players for their travel to the match, which Virtus Bologna won 84-77.","We must not turn blind eye to antisemitism, says Dutch king after attacks on Israeli football fans","We must not turn blind eye to antisemitism, says Dutch king after attacks on Israeli football fans",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2y33ee1klo,articles/article_3342.txt,results/article_3342.txt.json

The mayor of the south-western Japanese city, Shiro Suzuki, said on Thursday that Israel not being invited to attend was not politically motivated but added there would be no change to the decision. The remarks come a day after it was revealed that the ambassadors of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the US and the European Union had sent a letter to Nagasaki in mid-July saying ""it would become difficult for us to have high-level participation"" in the event if Israel was excluded.  The bomb dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 is thought to have killed about 74,000 people, both from the explosion itself and later from radiation. It came three days after the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima and six days before Japan's surrender in World War II. Mr Suzuki said security reasons, including potential demonstrations, were behind his decision not to invite Israel to the commemoration ceremony. But he said he regretted the ambassadors' decision. ""It is unfortunate that they have communicated to us that their ambassadors are not able to attend,"" he said. A spokesperson for the British embassy in Tokyo confirmed to the BBC that ambassador Julia Longbottom would not attend the ceremony in Nagasaki. Ambassador Longbottom had said that the decision not to invite Israel created an unfortunate and misleading equivalency with Russia and Belarus - the only other countries not invited to this year's ceremony. US Ambassador Rahm Emanuel will also not attend. An embassy statement said the mayor of Nagasaki politicised the event by snubbing Israel. A spokesperson told the BBC the ambassador would instead go to a peace ceremony at a temple in Tokyo. Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who was invited to and attended a memorial ceremony in Hiroshima on Tuesday, said Nagasaki’s decision ""sends a wrong message to the world"". In June, Mr Suzuki said Nagasaki had sent a letter to the Israeli embassy calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza. Almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's massive military offensive in Gaza, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. It was triggered by  the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages.

3345,2024-10-12 00:14:04.404000+00:00,/news/articles/c7v697l4q39o,"Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon is about to end its second week, as Israel’s war has already entered its second year. Appeals for a ceasefire have increased following an air strike in Beirut on Thursday night, and the wounding on Friday, for the second day running, of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon by Israeli military fire. A new offensive is taking place in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, despite persistent calls for the conflict there to end. Israel’s allies are also urging restraint as the country prepares to retaliate against Iran, following last week’s ballistic missile attack. However, Israel will continue to pursue its own path, and resist this pressure, because of three factors: 7 October, Benjamin Netanyahu and the United States. It was in January 2020 when Iranian general Qassem Soleimani landed at Baghdad airport on a night-time flight from Damascus. Soleimani was the head of Iran’s notorious Quds Force, an elite, clandestine unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps specialising in overseas operations. The group – whose name means Jerusalem, and whose main adversary was Israel - was responsible for arming, training, funding and directing proxy forces abroad in Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and beyond. At the time, Soleimani was perhaps the second most powerful man in Iran, after the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Soleimani’s convoy left the airport, it was destroyed by missiles fired from a drone that killed him instantly. Although Israel provided intelligence to help locate its arch-adversary, the drone belonged to the United States. The assassination order had been given by then US President Donald Trump, not Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,” former President Trump would later say in a speech referring to the Soleimani assassination. In a separate interview, Trump also suggested that he had expected Israel to play a more active role in the attack and complained that Netanyahu was “willing to fight Iran to the last American soldier”. While Trump’s account of events is disputed, at the time it was believed that Netanyahu, who praised the killing, was concerned that direct Israeli involvement could provoke a large-scale attack against Israel, either from Iran directly, or its proxies in Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories. Israel was fighting a shadow war with Iran, but each side was careful to keep the fighting within certain bounds, for fear of provoking the other into a larger-scale conflict. Just over four years later, in April of this year, the same Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israeli jets to bomb a building in the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals amongst others. Then in July, the Israeli prime minister authorised the assassination of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military commander, in an air strike on Beirut. The response of the current US president was reportedly to swear at him, according to a new book by Bob Woodward, who claims that President Joe Biden was aghast that Israel’s prime minister was prepared to escalate a conflict the White House had been trying to bring to an end for months. “You know, the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,” President Biden is reported to have said, external. The same prime minister, characterised as being too cautious by one US president, was then castigated as being too aggressive by his successor. What separates the two episodes is of course 7 October 2023 - the bloodiest day in the history of Israel and a political, military and intelligence failure of catastrophic proportions. What unites the two moments, however, is Netanyahu defying the will of a US president. Both factors help to explain the way Israel continues to prosecute the current war. Israel’s most recent wars concluded after a few weeks, once international pressure  built so much that the United States insisted on a ceasefire. The ferocity and scale of the Hamas attack against Israel,  the impact on Israeli society and its sense of security, mean that this war was always going to be unlike any recent conflict. For a US administration pouring billions of dollars’ worth of weapons into Israel, Palestinian civilian deaths and suffering in Gaza have been deeply uncomfortable, and politically damaging for the administration. For America’s critics in the region, the apparent impotence of the superpower when it comes to influencing the largest recipient of US aid is baffling. Even after US jets were involved in repelling Iranian attacks on Israel in April - a clear sign of how Israel’s security is underwritten by its larger ally - Israel continued to bat away attempts to change the course of its war. This summer, Israel chose to escalate its conflict with Hezbollah, without seeking prior approval from the United States. As Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Netanyahu has learned from more than 20 years of experience that US pressure is something he can withstand, if not ignore. Netanyahu knows that the US, particularly in an election year, will not take action that forces him to divert from his chosen course (and believes, in any event, that he is fighting America’s enemies too). Especially when it comes to the latest escalation, it would be wrong to assume that Netanayhu is operating outside the Israeli political mainstream. If anything, the pressure on him is to be tougher to strike harder against Hezbollah, but also Iran. When a ceasefire plan in Lebanon was mooted by the US and France last month, criticism of the proposed 21-day truce came from the opposition, and the main left-wing grouping in Israel, as well as the right-wing parties. Israel is determined to continue its wars now, not just because it feels it can withstand international pressure, but also because Israel’s tolerance of the threats it faces has shifted after 7 October. Hezbollah has for years stated its aim to invade the Galilee in northern Israel. Now that the Israeli public has experienced the reality of gunmen infiltrating homes, that threat cannot be contained, it must be removed. Israel’s perception of risk has also changed. Long-held notions of military red lines in the region have evaporated. Several acts have been committed in the past year that could, until recently, have led to an all-out conflict, raining bombs and missiles on Tehran, Beirut, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israel has assassinated the head of Hamas while he was a guest of the Iranians in Tehran; it has also killed the entire leadership of Hezbollah, including Hassan Nasrallah; it has assassinated senior Iranian officials inside diplomatic buildings in Syria. Hezbollah has fired more than 9,000 missiles, rockets and drones at Israeli cities, including ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv. The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen have also launched large missiles at Israel’s cities, intercepted by Israeli defences as they re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere above central Israel. Iran has launched not one, but two attacks against Israel in the past six months involving more than 500 drones and missiles. Israel has invaded Lebanon. Any one of these might, in the past, have precipitated a regional war. The fact that they have not will change the way a normally cautious, risk-averse Israeli prime minister decides on his next move.

3346,2024-11-06 11:45:09.352000+00:00,/news/articles/c2dl0e4l7lzo,"Donald Trump’s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it “America First”. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington’s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021. Follow live updates after Trump won US electionResults: Who did each state vote for?In maps and charts: How small gains delivered Trump a big winThese are the seven things Trump says he will do as presidentAnalysis - Why Kamala Harris lost: A flawed candidate or doomed campaign? During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day”. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump’s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine’s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump’s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.  Analysis: The view from countries where Trump's win really mattersWhat does a Trump win mean for the UK?Trade, aid, security: What does Trump's victory mean for Africa?US election is a major setback for climate action, experts sayAnalysis: Will Trump's victory spark a global trade war? It’s not clear how far the former advisers’ paper represents Trump’s own thinking, but it’s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he’ll get. His “America First” approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. Nato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America’s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance’s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance’s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders. As with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring “peace” to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his “maximum pressure” policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it’s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran’s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump’s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the “best friend that Israel has ever had in the White House”. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington’s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called “Abraham Accords”, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It’s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump’s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it’s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas. America’s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a “strategic competitor” and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a “Chinese virus”. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports. What Chinese people want from the USThe trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring.  Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both “brilliant” and “dangerous” and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an “iron fist”- part of what opponents characterised as Trump’s admiration for “dictators”. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration’s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing’s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was “[expletive] crazy”, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.

Early indications suggest that he and his bodyguards died when a rocket hit the house where he was staying in Tehran. All eyes will inevitably fall on Israel, which vowed to hunt down and punish all Hamas leaders following the brutal attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed. Israel typically does not comment on its operations abroad, but this attack may have followed the same pattern as an Israeli operation which targeted Iranian air defences around its nuclear facility in Natanz on 19 April. Israeli jets are believed to have fired rockets from outside Iranian airspace. But while details of the attack slowly emerge, its political consequences are also coming into focus. The most obvious is the likely damage to fragile efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza. Ismail Haniyeh may not have been in charge of day-to-day events on the ground in Gaza – that is the domain of the military commander Yahya Sinwar – but as the Hamas leader in exile he was a critical interlocutor in negotiations brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt. American officials had recently suggested that ceasefire negotiations might soon succeed, although a meeting in Rome last weekend did not result in a breakthrough. But it is extremely hard to see how any progress can be made in the immediate wake of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

""It has been revealed once again that the government of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu has no intention of achieving peace,""  it said in a statement. In Ramallah, headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, news of Haniyeh’s death has been greeted with dismay. “It’s opening the door of hell,” Sabri Saidam, deputy secretary general of the Central Committee of the ruling party, Fatah, told the BBC. Mr Saidam said he was feeling a mixture of shock and anger. “Not only did I feel that Israel was targeting the life of Ismail Haniyeh,” he said, “but rather the life of any settlement in the region. Israel has killed all hopes and aspirations for an end to hostilities. ”Fatah and Hamas have long been rivals, sometimes bloody rivals. But Mr Saidam strongly rejected the suggestion that Fatah might benefit from the death of the Hamas leader. “There's never been in Palestinian politics a feeling that leadership by elimination is the way forward,” he said. “If anything, it creates more resentment and more friction. ”A strike has been called in Ramallah and across the West Bank. Shops are closed and a protest march being held which could be an awkward moment for the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. The most recent opinion poll showed that Ismael Haniyeh was considerably more popular than the elderly Palestinian President, Mahmud Abbas. The timing of Haniyeh's killing suggests this was a wider part of Israel’s threatened retaliation for the Hezbollah rocket attack that killed 12 Druze children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday - retaliation that included the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel had warned that its response would be harsh. Israeli officials regularly point out that Iran is the nexus for the so-called “arc of resistance” in the Middle East, which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, and the Houthis in Yemen. After dealing a blow to Hezbollah in Beirut (and recently to the Houthis in Hodeidah), killing the Hamas leader in Iran sends an emphatic, chilling message, to the militant groups and their Iranian backers: Israel can and will come after you, wherever you are.",What does Haniyeh's killing mean for Gaza ceasefire?,What does Haniyeh's killing mean for Gaza ceasefire?,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clly4v4l13vo,articles/article_3347.txt,results/article_3347.txt.json

The soldiers have ordered the men to strip to their underwear. Even some of the elderly ones. They gaze up at whoever is taking the photograph. It is almost certainly an Israeli soldier. The image appears to have first been published on the Telegram account of a journalist with strong sources in the Israel Defence Forces. The men look abject, fearful and exhausted. The little girl, who was noticed in the picture by a BBC producer, is looking away. Maybe something out of sight of the camera has caught her attention. Or maybe she just doesn’t want to look at the soldiers and their guns. The military have told the people to stop here. Bomb-blasted buildings stretch off into the distance behind them. They are checking the men, for weapons, documents, any sign they might be linked to Hamas. So often the suffering of this war is found in the detail of individual lives. The child’s presence, her expression as she looks away, is a detail that poses so many questions. Foremost, who was she? What happened to her? The photo was taken a week ago. A week of hundreds killed, many wounded, and thousands uprooted from their homes. Children died under the rubble of air strikes or because there wasn’t the medicine or medical staff to treat them. Working with BBC Arabic Gaza Today programme we began searching for the child. Israel does not allow the BBC or other international media access to Gaza to report independently, so the BBC depends on a trusted network of freelance journalists. Our colleagues approached their contacts with aid agencies in the north, showing the photograph in places where the displaced had fled. Within 48 hours word came back. The message on the phone read: “We have found her!”Julia Abu Warda, aged three, was alive. When our journalist reached the family in Gaza City - where many from Jabalia have fled - Julia was with her father, grandfather and mother. She was watching a cartoon of animated chickens singing, difficult to hear because of the ominous whine of an Israeli drone overhead. Julia was surprised to suddenly be the focus of a stranger’s attention. ""Who are you?"" her father asked, playfully. ""Jooliaa"" she replied, stretching the word for emphasis. Julia was physically unscathed. Dressed in a jumper and jeans, her hair in buns held by bright blue floral bands. But her expression was wary. Then Mohammed began to tell the story behind the photograph. Five times the family was displaced in the last 21 days. Each time they were running from air strikes and gunfire. On the day the photo was taken they heard an Israeli drone broadcasting a warning to evacuate. This was in the Al-Khalufa district where the IDF was advancing against Hamas. “There was random shellfire. We went toward the centre of Jabalia refugee camp, on the road to the checkpoint. ”The family carried their clothes, some cans of tinned food, and a few personal possessions. At first everybody was together. Julia’s dad, her mother Amal, her 15-month-old brother Hamza, a grandfather, two uncles and a cousin. But in the chaos, Mohammed and Julia were separated from the others. “I got separated from her mother due to the crowd and all the belongings we were carrying. She was able to leave, and I stayed in place,” Mohammed said. Father and daughter eventually moved on with the flow of people heading out. The streets reeked of death. “We saw destruction and bodies scattered on the ground,” Mohammed said. There was no way to stop Julia seeing at least some of it. After more than a year of war, children have become familiar with the sight of those who have died violent deaths. The group reached an Israeli checkpoint. “There were soldiers on the tanks and soldiers on the ground. They approached the people and started firing above their heads. People were pushing against each other during the shooting. ”The men were ordered to strip to their underwear. This is routine procedure as the IDF searches for concealed weapons or suicide bombers. Mohammed says they were held at the checkpoint for six to seven hours. In the photograph Julia appears calm. But her father recalled her distress afterwards. “She started screaming and told me she wanted her mother. ” The family was reunited. The displaced are packed into small areas. Bonds of family are tight. Word travels fast in Gaza City when kin arrive from Jabalia. Julia was comforted by the people who loved her. There were sweets and potato chips, a treat that had been stored away. Then Mohammed disclosed to our colleague the deep trauma Julia had suffered, before that day of their flight from Jabalia to Gaza City. She had a favourite cousin. His name was Yahya and he was seven years old. They used to play together in the street. About two weeks ago Yahya was in the street when the Israelis launched a drone strike. The child was killed. “Life used to be normal. She would run and play,” he said. “But now, whenever there’s shelling, she points and says, ‘plane!’ While we are trapped she looks up and points towards the drone flying over us. ” According to Unicef - the United Nations children’s agency -14,000 children have been reportedly killed in the war. “Day after day children are paying the price for a war they did not start,” said Unicef spokesman, Jonathan Crickx. “Most of the children I have met have lost a loved one in often terrible circumstances. ” The UN estimates that nearly all children in the Gaza Strip - nearly one million - need mental health support. It is hard to call a child like Julia lucky. When you think of what she has seen and lost and where she is trapped. Who knows what will return in dreams and memories in the days ahead. By now she knows that life can end with terrible suddenness. Her good fortune is in the family that will do whatever is humanly possible - in the face of air strikes, gun battles, hunger and disease - to protect her.

3349,2024-08-01 17:43:20.256000+00:00,/news/articles/c1wex26nl61o,"Since the war began in Gaza following Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, its leaders have been targeted, allegedly by Israel. Some have been killed, others remain defiant. Here is a rundown of what has happened to Hamas's most prominent figures.  Ismail Haniyeh was widely considered Hamas's overall leader. He was assassinated, reportedly in an aerial strike, on a building he was staying in during a visit to Tehran on 31 July, 2024. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the strike. A prominent member of Hamas in the late 1980s, Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising. He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders. After a year he returned to Gaza. In 1997 he was appointed head of the office of Hamas's spiritual leader, strengthening his position. Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections. But he was dismissed a year later amid deadly violence in Gaza, with Hamas ultimately ousting Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip. Haniyeh rejected his sacking as ""unconstitutional"", and Hamas continued to rule in Gaza. He was elected head of Hamas's all-powerful political bureau in 2017, making him in effect overall leader. In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the last several years. Yahya Sinwar is the leader of the Hamas movement within the Gaza Strip. Israel believes he masterminded the unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023. Sinwar was born in Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza in 1962. A year after Hamas was founded in 1987, he formed its internal security service, which amongst other things targeted alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel. Sinwar was arrested by Israel three times. He was sentenced to four life terms in 1988 for planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians. However, in 2011 he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in exchange for an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for over five years. Sinwar returned to his position as a prominent leader in Hamas and was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017, making him Hamas's leader in the territory. In 2015, the US included Sinwar on its blacklist of ""international terrorists"". Sinwar has not been seen since the start of the war with Israel in October.  He is believed to still be in Gaza, hiding “10 storeys underground”, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mohammed Deif was the head of Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement. He was Israel's most wanted man for decades, and was killed in an Israeli air strike last month, Israel says. Hamas has not confirmed this. Deif, a shadowy figure, became known to Palestinians as The Mastermind, and to Israelis as The Cat with Nine Lives. Israeli authorities imprisoned him in 1989 during the first Palestinian intifada (uprising), and released him after a year and half. Soon afterwards he formed the al-Qassam Brigades, with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers. He also helped engineer the construction of tunnels that enabled Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza. Deif was accused by Israel of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. He was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in 2000, but escaped seven months later at the beginning of the second intifada. He became Israel's most wanted man, but since then left behind little trace. The most serious assassination attempts on his life were in 2002: Deif survived but lost one of his eyes. Israel says he also lost a foot and a hand, and was left with difficulty speaking. Israel tried and failed again to assassinate Deif during a 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip, but killed his wife and two of his children. Deif was one of the figures accused of planning the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023. Israel said it killed him in an air strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area of Gaza on 13 July.  Hamas has not confirmed that Marwan Issa, deputy commander-in-chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in March 2024, as reported by the White House. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he had been killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), following reports in Israeli media that he had died in a strike on a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp. The senior commander is also known as the Shadow Man and has been viewed as Mohammed Deif's right-hand man. Prior to reports of his death, he was on Israel's most wanted list, and was injured when Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2006. Israeli forces detained him during the first intifada for five years because of his activity with Hamas. The Palestinian Authority arrested him in 1997, but he was freed after the second intifada in 2000. Israeli warplanes also destroyed his house twice during invasions of Gaza in 2014 and 2021, killing his brother. It was not known what he looked like until 2011, when he appeared in a group photo taken during a reception for exchanged prisoners. He is thought to have played a significant role in planning incursions into Israel, including the most recent. Khaled Meshaal, who was born in the West Bank in 1956, is considered one of the founders of Hamas. Under direct instructions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Mossad spy agency attempted to assassinate Meshaal in 1997 while he was living in Jordan. Mossad agents entered Jordan with forged Canadian passports and Meshaal was injected with a toxic substance while walking along a street. Jordanian authorities discovered the assassination attempt and arrested two Mossad members. The late King Hussein of Jordan asked Israel's prime minister for the antidote for the substance Meshaal was injected with. Facing pressure from then-US President Bill Clinton, Mr Netanyahu provided it, after initially rejecting the request. Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, visited the Gaza Strip for the first time in 2012. He was received by Palestinian officials and crowds of Palestinians came out to welcome him. Hamas elected Ismail Haniyeh to succeed Meshaal as head of its political bureau in 2017, and Meshaal became head of the group's political bureau abroad. Mahmoud Zahar was born in Gaza in 1945 to a Palestinian father and an Egyptian mother. He is considered one of Hamas' most prominent leaders, and a member of the movement's political leadership. He went to school in Gaza and university in Cairo, then worked as a doctor in Gaza and Khan Younis until Israeli authorities dismissed him over his political position. Mahmoud Zahar was held in Israeli prisons in 1988, months after the founding of Hamas. He was among those deported by Israel to no-man's land in 1992, where he spent a year. With the Hamas movement winning Palestinian general elections in 2006, Zahar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh's newly formed government before its eventual dismissal. Israel attempted to assassinate Zahar in 2003, when a plane dropped a bomb on his house in Gaza City. The attack left him with minor injuries, but killed his eldest son, Khaled. His second son, Hossam, who was a member of the al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza in 2008.",What has happened to Hamas's most prominent leaders?,What has happened to Hamas's most prominent leaders?,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wex26nl61o,articles/article_3349.txt,results/article_3349.txt.json
3350,2024-11-07 15:46:03.898000+00:00,/news/articles/c89v72q71d3o,"When Israel declared last month that it would target a Hezbollah-linked Lebanese microloan charity it triggered a frenzied search for a list of the organisation’s branches. People across the country tried to figure out whether they needed to flee their homes where the branches were located before Israel started bombing. Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), a charity that offers interest-free microloans, had grown in prominence over the past decade amid US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon’s banking sector. Hassan lives with his family in Beirut, 200m (655ft) away from a branch of AQAH. “We heard about it from this guy Avichay,” he said, referring to Avichay Adraee, a spokesman in Arabic for the Israeli army who announces evacuation orders on social media. “Then the bombing started in [the southern Beirut suburb of] Dahieh. We could hear it: ‘Boom, boom, boom. ’ The kids jump at every ‘boom’. ”With nowhere else to go, Hassan took his family to the seaside, where they spent a sleepless night squeezed together in the car. The Israeli air force attacked around 30 AQAH branches that night, but the branch next to Hassan’s home was spared, and he went back the next morning. Israel has been hitting some of the civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah, as part of its campaign in Lebanon. Aside from the AQAH, it has hit the Islamic Health Society (IHS), funded by Hezbollah, which operates emergency services, hospitals and medical centres across the county. It has also struck its search-and-rescue teams, killing dozens of rescue workers. Israel claims Hezbollah “is using the IHS as a cover for terrorist activities” and that those killed were carrying out military roles - but that is denied by the IHS. Israel has also hit buildings housing people who had been displaced by its bombing and evacuation orders. Such attacks raised widespread suspicion here in Lebanon that Israel is targeting the civilian population that is supportive of Hezbollah - widely referred to here as the ‘bi’a’ of Hezbollah, a word that translates literally as “environment”, and is taken to refer to the social base of the group. It is a community made up of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who support the party, vote for it, are employed by various civilian organisations linked to it, or are relatives of Hezbollah fighters and members. Hezbollah’s relationship with that social base - concentrated in Shia-majority areas in the south, the eastern Bekaa valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut – has long been considered a source of strength for the group. But it has also placed it in the crosshairs of Hezbollah’s enemies. Israel says AQAH finances Hezbollah’s military activities - a claim denied by the group, which says it has no role beyond offering small, interest-free loans to ordinary Lebanese, in line with Islamic law’s prohibition on charging interest. Following the strikes on AQAH branches last month, Israel’s then-defence minister said on X that Israel was “destroying the terrorist organisation’s ability to both launch and buy missiles”. From an international humanitarian law perspective, experts say AQAH is not a lawful military target regardless of Israel’s claims that it plays a role in financing Hezbollah. “International humanitarian law does not permit attacks on the economic or financial infrastructure of an adversary, even if they indirectly sustain its military activities,” according to Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism. Mr Saul said the bombing “obliterates the distinction between civilian objects and military objectives” and “opens the door to ‘total war’ against civilian populations”. So what could Israel hope to achieve by bombing civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah?Amal Saad, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University and a leading expert on Hezbollah, believes the attacks are aimed at dismantling what is also known as Hezbollah’s “community of resistance. ”“Hezbollah is probably the second biggest employer after the state,” says Ms Saad. “Its civilian institutions affect hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, mainly Shia. It’s a way of strangulating the community further. ”It would not be the first time Hezbollah’s social base came under attack. During the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, Israel flattened neighbourhoods in Dahieh, and two years later, revealed a military strategy drawn from that experience - what came to be known as the Dahieh Doctrine. It was first articulated by then-Maj Gen Gadi Eizenkot in 2008 when he was head of the Israeli military’s Northern Command. This doctrine - as it came to be known - called for applying “disproportionate force” against civilian areas where Israel believes it is attacked from, with the goal of pressuring the people of Lebanon to turn on Hezbollah to undermine support for it. ‘From our perspective, these are military bases…,” he said at the time. “Harming the population is the only means of restraining [Hassan] Nasrallah,"" he said, referring to the then-leader of Hezbollah. Nasrallah was killed in an air strike in Dahieh in September 2024. Now, Israel is striking that population in areas far removed from combat, such as Wardaniyeh, north-east of Sidon, in addition to striking Hezbollah’s network of civilian organisations. In a response to the BBC, the IDF said it was “operating solely against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, not against the Lebanese population or medical facilities, and as such takes many measures to mitigate harm to civilians”. “The IDF operations have been planned based on extensive intelligence gathering and in strict accordance with international law,” it added. AQAH is just one of several organisations linked to Hezbollah that throws lifelines to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese - especially those that form the movement’s base. Its story is intertwined with that of Lebanon’s financial and economic collapse. Founded in the early 1980s, it gave out loans to families and newly-weds, helping them meet different personal needs. More recently, the association was also beginning to offer loans for such things as agricultural projects and solar panels. The US imposed sanctions on AQAH in 2007, saying it was being used by Hezbollah “as a cover to manage its financial activities”. It was thrust into the spotlight again in August 2019, when the US treasury sanctioned Jammal Trust Bank, claiming, among other things, that it “knowingly facilitates the banking activities of US-designated entities openly affiliated with Hezbollah”, including AQAH. The bank was forced to close less than three weeks later. But the combination of US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon’s banking sector in October 2019 caused the association to grow like never before. As a result of sanctions on individuals and entities the US said had links to Hezbollah, Lebanese banks closed accounts of people they suspected might cause them trouble with the US treasury. Many of them took their money to AQAH. Then, even more people deposited money there due to the collapse of trust in the banking system - after Lebanese banks withheld people’s savings, following the financial and economic collapse in 2019. AQAH ended up being a support for many Lebanese who were ejected from the financial system due to US sanctions, and then for more people who had nowhere to deposit their savings following the crash. Many of them will be among the million or so displaced people scattered across Lebanon today  - mostly from the south, the Bekaa, and Beirut’s southern suburbs. Many of them are crammed together in government-run shelters and empty buildings. They watch helplessly as much of their villages and cities has been decimated by the Israeli military. Those whose homes are still standing live in fearful anticipation of the next wave of bombing, while those with deposits with AQAH now worry that their savings are gone, in their hour of greatest need. The displaced have themselves also been bombed, in areas far removed from combat zones - such as in the Christian majority northern village of Aitou, where 23 people were killed in an air strike last month - and their host communities across the country are increasingly uneasy; no-one knows when and where Israel might strike. Meanwhile in the south, Hezbollah and the Israeli army have been clashing directly for a month now, after Israel launched an invasion of south Lebanon in early October. Whichever way the fighting on the ground goes, Israel is exerting pressure on Lebanese society as a whole, through its strikes on civilian institutions like AQAH. Some have argued that such attacks may be part of a strategy aimed at ripping through Lebanon’s social fabric, and transforming the country into a hostile environment for Hezbollah and its “community of resistance”.",What is Israel’s strategy in targeting Hezbollah’s civilian network?,What is Israel’s strategy in targeting Hezbollah’s civilian network?,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89v72q71d3o,articles/article_3350.txt,results/article_3350.txt.json
3351,2024-10-29 18:02:24.057000+00:00,/news/articles/c8jy9v43z89o,"Israel's parliament voted on Monday evening to ban the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and occupied East Jerusalem. Contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will be banned, crippling its ability to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Almost all of Gaza's population of more than two million people are dependent on aid and services from the agency. The move has faced widespread condemnation, with Unrwa warning the new law could see aid supply chains ""fall apart"" in the coming weeks. Israel has defended the move, repeating its allegation that a number of the agency's staff were involved in Hamas's 7 October attacks last year, which killed 1,200 people. However, Israel's opposition to Unrwa also goes back decades.  Founded in 1949, the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or Unrwa, works in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, initially caring for the 700,000 Palestinians who were forced from or fled their homes after the creation of the state of Israel. Over the decades, Unrwa has grown to become the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza. It employs some 13,000 people there and is key to humanitarian efforts. It is funded primarily by voluntary donations by UN member states, with the UN itself providing some direct funds. It distributes aid and runs shelters and key infrastructure - such as medical facilities, teacher training centres and almost 300 primary schools. Since the war in Gaza began, the agency says it has distributed food parcels to almost 1.9 million people. It has also offered nearly six million medical consultations across the enclave over the course of the conflict. More than 200 Unrwa staff have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 2023 in the course of those duties, according to the agency.  Unwra has long been criticised by Israel, with many there objecting to its very existence. The fate of refugees has been a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with Palestinians harbouring a dream of returning to homes in historic Palestine, parts of which are now in Israel. Israel rejects their claim and criticises the set-up of Unrwa for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations. It says this entrenches Palestinians as refugees, and encourages their hopes of a right of return. The Israeli government has also long denounced the agency's teaching and textbooks for, in its view, perpetuating anti-Israel views. In 2022, an Israeli watchdog said Unrwa educational material taught students that Israel was attempting to ""erase Palestinian identity”. The European Commission identified what it called ""anti-Semitic material"" in the schoolbooks, ""including even incitement to violence"", and the European Parliament has called repeatedly for EU funding to the Palestinian Authority to be conditional on removing such content. Unrwa has previously said reports about its educational material were ""inaccurate and misleading"" and that many of the books in question were not used in its schools.  After the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, allegations that some Unrwa staff were involved further amplified calls in Israel for the agency to be banned. The military claimed that in total, more than 450 Unrwa staff were members of ""terrorist organisations"". In the wake of the allegations, some 16 Western countries temporarily suspended funding for the aid agency. The UN investigated Israel’s claim and fired nine people, but it said Israel had not provided evidence for more allegations and Unrwa denied any wider involvement with Hamas. Speaking on Monday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the allegations, writing on X that ""Unrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable. "" Under the new law - which was approved by 92 MPs and opposed by just 10 - contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will be banned.  While most of Unrwa's projects take place in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, it relies on agreements with Israel to operate. This includes moving aid through checkpoints between Israel and Gaza. Along with the Palestinian Red Crescent, Unrwa handles almost all aid distribution in Gaza through 11 centres across the enclave. It also provides services to 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. Unrwa director William Deere told the BBC that on a practical level, the ban on interacting with Israeli officials meant it would become almost impossible for the agency's staff to operate in the country. ""We won't be able to move in Gaza without being subject to possible attack, international staff won't be able to get visas any longer,"" he said. The executive director of the UN's World Food Programme said without Unrwa's presence in Gaza, aid agencies will be unable to distribute essential food and medicine. ""They do all the work on the ground there,"" Cindy McCain told the BBC. ""We don't have the contacts. We don't have the ability to get to know the contacts, because things are so intensely difficulty there. ""Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Monday that ""sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza"" despite Unrwa's ban, and that Israel would work with its international partners to ensure this. But on Monday the US state department said Israel must do ""much more"" to allow international aid to enter Gaza. The warning came two weeks after it gave Israel 30 days to boost supplies, or risk seeing some military assistance cut.

3352,2024-08-30 13:34:50.809000+00:00,/news/articles/c4gejxxk820o,"A series of “humanitarian pauses” to fighting in Gaza are due to begin on Sunday, to allow hundreds of thousands of children to be vaccinated against polio. The agreement comes after UN officials said a 10-month-old has been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza’s first recorded case of polio in 25 years. Polio is a serious and highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five. It is caused by a virus that spreads very easily through contact with the faeces (poo) of an infected person or, less commonly, through contaminated water or food. Most people with the infection have no symptoms but some will have:a high temperaturesore throatheadacheneck stiffnessaching musclesstomach painnauseaOne in 200 infections, external lead to more serious problems, when the virus invades the brain and nervous system. This can causes irreversible paralysis, usually of the legs. It can happen within a matter of hours and some 5 to 10% of the people who are paralysed die because their breathing muscles become immobilised. Humanitarian groups say the virus has re-emerged because the war between Israel and Hamas has disrupted regular child vaccination programmes. It has also caused massive damage to water and sanitation systems. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. In 2022, polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% for two doses of vaccine. However, this has dropped to less than 90%, according to the latest data, external. The aim is to vaccinate some 640,000 children under the age of 10, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The roll-out will start in central Gaza on Sunday, with three consecutive daily pauses in fighting between 6am and 3pm local time. It will then move to southern Gaza, where there will be another three-day pause, followed by northern Gaza. According to UN officials, children who get the vaccine will need a second dose in late September. Healthcare workers aim to achieve 95% vaccine coverage across the strip, the level needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza. If this is not achieved there is an agreement for an additional humanitarian pause to allow a fourth day of vaccination. About 1.3m doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are already in Gaza, with 400,000 extra doses set to arrive soon. Vaccinations will be carried out by UN staff and other local health workers. More than 2,000 health and community outreach workers have been trained to give the vaccine. Vaccines will be available in hospitals, field hospitals and primary health centres. According to the WHO, safe transport and refrigeration of the vaccines are crucial to the plan.  Poliovirus cases have fallen dramatically since 1988, when a global polio eradication initiative, external was launched. Many countries have not had cases of polio in many years. But in two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, polio is still endemic, which means it has a constant presence. There have also been outbreaks of poliovirus variants - strains related to the oral vaccine -  in more than , external30 countries around the world, external, particularly in areas where immunisation rates are low. They include Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, DR Congo, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Algeria, Angola,  Indonesia. The WHO says as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of getting polio, because the virus can easily be imported into a polio-free country. There is no cure for polio. It can only be prevented by vaccination, and vaccines must be given multiple times to protect a child for life. There are two main types of vaccines available, external. One is an oral vaccine that is given as drops and is effective and easy to administer. The oral vaccine contains a live but weakened from of the virus. This replicates in the gut for a short time and activates the immune system so the body is ready to fight off polio if it encounters the virus again. Rarely, the weakened vaccine-virus can pick up small genetic changes as it replicates. These rare changes can sometimes cause the virus to make people ill with polio -  if it has the chance to spread to unvaccinated people. In Gaza, a novel version of the oral vaccine will be given to help address this. The other main form of polio vaccine is given by injection and contains inactivated polio virus. It has been used in the US and UK for the last two decades. In the UK, the National Health Service , externaloffers five doses from the ages of eight weeks to 14 years as part of routine childhood jabs. Because of vaccines, more than 20 million people who would otherwise have been paralysed are able to walk, according to the WHO.

3353,2024-10-21 18:21:48.143000+00:00,/news/articles/cz6w6p8x7p8o,"US investigators are trying to find out how a pair of highly classified intelligence documents were leaked online. The documents, which appeared on the messaging app Telegram on Friday, contain an alleged US assessment of Israeli plans to attack Iran. The assessment is based on interpretation of satellite imagery and other intelligence. On Monday White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said President Joe Biden was ""deeply concerned"" about the leak. Latest updates: Hezbollah launches rockets after Israeli strike kills four in LebanonOfficials have not determined whether the documents were released due to a hack or a leak, Mr Kirby said. For three weeks now, Israel has been vowing to hit Iran hard in retaliation for Iran’s massed ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. Iran says that was in response to Israel’s assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on 27 September. Military analysts say the phrasing used in the headings looks credible and is consistent with similar classified documents revealed in the past. Headed ""Top Secret"", they include the acronym ""FGI"", standing for ""Foreign Government Intelligence"". The documents appear to have been circulated to intelligence agencies in the Five Eyes alliance, the five Western nations that regularly share intelligence, namely the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The acronym ""TK"" in the documents refers to ""Talent Keyhole"", a codeword covering satellite-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT). Taken together, the two documents are a classified US assessment of Israel’s preparations to hit targets in Iran, based on intelligence analysed on 15-16 October by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. What features prominently is the mention of two Air-launched Ballistic Missile (ALBM) systems: Golden Horizon and Rocks. Rocks is a long-range missile system made by the Israeli company Rafael and designed to hit a variety of targets both above and below ground. Golden Horizon is thought to refer to the Blue Sparrow missile system with a range of around 2,000km (1,240 miles). The significance of this is that it would indicate that the Israeli Air Force is planning to carry out a similar but greatly expanded version of its ABLM attack on an Iranian radar site near Isfahan in April. By launching these weapons from long range and far from Iran’s borders it would avoid the need for Israeli warplanes to overfly certain countries in the region like Jordan. The documents also report no sign of any preparations by Israel to activate its nuclear deterrent. At the request of Israel, the US government never publicly acknowledges that its close ally Israel even possesses nuclear weapons, so this has caused some embarrassment in Washington. Glaringly absent from these documents is any mention of what targets Israel intends to hit in Iran, or when. The US has made no secret of its opposition to the targeting of either Iran’s nuclear research facilities or its oil installations. That leaves military bases, most likely those belonging to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and its affiliated Basij militia as these two institutions are seen as the backbone of the Islamic Republic, projecting its military reach abroad and suppressing popular protest at home. As regards timing, many had expected Israel to have carried out its promised retaliation by now. But back in April, Iran waited 12 days before hitting back at Israel with a barrage of 300 drones and missiles after an Israeli air strike hit its diplomatic buildings in Damascus, killing several senior IRGC commanders. Part of the current delay in Israel’s response is likely due to US concerns at escalation with less than a month to go before the US presidential elections. Possibly yes, by someone who wanted to derail Israel’s plans. Iran has a large and sophisticated cyber-warfare capability so the possibility of a hostile hack is also being investigated. These documents, if genuine as thought highly likely, show that despite the close defence relationship between the US and Israel, Washington still spies on its ally in case it is not being given the full picture. They show that plans by the Israeli Air Force to carry out some kind of long-range retaliation against Iran are well advanced and that mitigation is being put in place against an expected Iranian response. In short: if and when Israel does carry out these plans then the Middle East will once again experience a period of extreme tension.",What leaked US assessment of Israeli plans to strike Iran shows,What leaked US assessment of Israeli plans to strike Iran shows,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6w6p8x7p8o,articles/article_3353.txt,results/article_3353.txt.json
3354,2024-09-28 19:29:09.662000+00:00,/news/articles/c5yj7r029yyo,"Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-standing leader of Hezbollah, is a major escalation in its war with the Lebanese militant group. It has, potentially, brought the region one step closer to a much wider and even more damaging conflict, one that pulls in both Iran and the US. So where is it likely to go from here?That largely depends on three basic questions. Hezbollah is reeling from blow after blow. Its command structure has been decapitated, with more than a dozen top commanders assassinated. Its communications have been sabotaged with the shocking detonations of its pagers and walkie-talkies, and many of its weapons have been destroyed in air strikes. The US-based Middle East security analyst Mohammed Al-Basha says: ""The loss of Hassan Nasrallah will have significant implications, potentially destabilising the group and altering its political and military strategies in the short term. ""But any expectation that this vehemently anti-Israel organisation is going to suddenly give up and seek peace on Israel’s terms is likely to be misplaced. LIVE: Latest Israel-Lebanon updates as Israeli strikes continue Hezbollah has already vowed to continue the fight. It still has thousands of fighters, many of them recent veterans of combat in Syria, and they are demanding revenge. It still has a substantial arsenal of missiles, many of them long-range, precision-guided weapons which can reach Tel Aviv and other cities. There will be pressure within its ranks to use those soon, before they too get destroyed. But if they do, in a mass attack that overwhelms Israel’s air defences and kills civilians, then Israel’s response is likely to be devastating, wreaking havoc on Lebanon’s infrastructure, or even extending to Iran. This assassination is as much of a blow to Iran as it is to Hezbollah. It's already announced five days of mourning. It's also taken emergency precautions, hiding away its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, in case he too gets assassinated. Iran has yet to retaliate for the humiliating assassination in July of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in a Tehran guesthouse. What has happened now will be causing hardliners in the regime to contemplate some kind of response. Iran has a whole galaxy of allied heavily-armed militias around the Middle East, the so-called ""Axis of Resistance"". As well as Hezbollah, it has the Houthis in Yemen, and numerous groups in Syria and Iraq. Iran could well ask these groups to step up their attacks on both Israel and US bases in the region. But whatever response Iran chooses, it will likely calibrate it to be just short of triggering a war that it cannot hope to win. If anyone was in any doubt before this assassination, they won’t be now. Israel clearly has no intention of pausing its military campaign for the 21-day ceasefire proposed by 12 nations, including its closest ally, the United States. Its military reckon they have Hezbollah on the back foot now, so it will want to press on with its offensive until the threat of those missiles is removed. Short of a capitulation by Hezbollah - which is unlikely - it is hard to see how Israel can achieve its war aim of removing the threat of Hezbollah attacks without sending in troops on the ground. The Israel Defense Forces have released footage of its infantry training close to the border for this very purpose. But Hezbollah has also spent the last 18 years, since the end of the last war, training to fight the next one. In his final public speech before his death, Nasrallah told his followers that an Israeli incursion into south Lebanon would be, in his words, ""a historic opportunity"". For the IDF, going into Lebanon would be relatively easy. But getting out could - like Gaza - take months.","What might Hezbollah, Israel and Iran do next?","What might Hezbollah, Israel and Iran do next?",israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yj7r029yyo,articles/article_3354.txt,results/article_3354.txt.json
3355,2024-10-04 12:51:28.466000+00:00,/news/articles/clylzx1xz2yo,"On 1 October, Israel began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Shortly afterwards, Iran launched more than 180 missiles towards Israel. With the war in Gaza still ongoing, fears of an all-out regional conflict in the Middle East remain high. How big a danger is this threat of further escalation? For BBC InDepth, we asked a range of experts to share their analysis of why the conflict has escalated, and what might happen next. Israel seems to have upgraded its goals from weakening Hezbollah to enforce a ceasefire deal that secures Israel’s north, to seeking to neutralise Hezbollah permanently. Despite inflicting huge losses on Hezbollah, Israel’s military campaign won’t make Hezbollah disappear. It’s hard to know the difference between government rhetoric and what it will do on the ground. What they say they’re doing is removing the threat of Hezbollah to protect civilians in Northern Israel who live in sovereign territory and need to return after being displaced for a year as a result of ongoing rocket fire from Hezbollah, who joined the fight with Hamas after October 7. But this government also has religious forces setting forth, not a strategy, but a cosmic vision of conquest. And therefore we can’t rule out that there may be an expansionist ethos. Israel would like the Lebanese state to reassert authority over Hezbollah. This reminds me of the 1982 Israeli ground war in Lebanon against the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. That didn’t turn out so well in the long-term for Israeli citizens living near the Lebanese border. Israel in this case will need to focus on the short-term gain of calming the situation enough that its displaced 60,000 residents of northern Israel can return to their homes. The balance of power in the Middle East is beginning to shift in a way that is weakening Iran’s influence in the region. But any such change in the status quo is a process that will take a long time to materialise. It’s too soon to reach that conclusion, but what’s certain is the Iran-led axis is reeling and Israel seems to have achieved some significant tactical gains. Whether it can translate those to strategic gains through diplomacy remains to be seen. Not the map, but the power balance for sure. For the past 20 years, Iran and its proxies (Hamas and Hezbollah) on one side and Israel on the other have held each other to a draw, meaning there was mutual deterrence. That was shattered on 7 October, and Israel is trying to get the upper hand. It’s too soon to tell. My feeling is, talk to me in two weeks or talk to me in a year and we will know if there’s been a re-occupation of Southern Lebanon… At the same time, you have the conflict with Iran, but I don’t think they’re trying to redraw the borders in the Middle East. The fact that Iran has clearly lost Hamas and Hezbollah as effective deterrents means that an increasing number of figures in the Iranian establishment are going to want to develop a nuclear weapon. However, what does this mean in practice? And when will Israel find out? Israeli intelligence is pretty good in Iran - if Iran does start building a weapon, will Israel find out next week? If Iran goes ahead with this, it enters a very risky area. But as things stand, Iran’s conventional military capabilities are a joke compared to Israel’s, so it has relied on non-traditional means such as militias - which have proved to be of little use. The nuclear ambition in Iran is a concern for Israel for obvious reasons. Anti-Israel animus remains central to the regime. For Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the project to destroy Israel is the oldest and most central demand. It’s the only project he’s been able to advance towards, and the only thing the Islamic Republic is a leader in is the anti-Israel project - it’s the only state in the world that shoots at Israel. However, there is a more pragmatic element within the Iranian political establishment, which often gets forgotten, and which believes Iran has no business fighting the Palestinian war for the Palestinians. Iran will do whatever it takes to secure its nuclear programme. It will perceive an Israeli attack on its nuclear programme as an existential threat. It may be that in the Iranian perception, the only thing they’ve got left that could potentially genuinely be a game-changer, is to go nuclear. I don’t know what exactly that might mean – maybe they have a capability already, and they could demonstrate it by conducting a nuclear test in the desert somewhere. Israel’s widening campaign is sowing increasing anger among the populations in the Middle East who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. This makes achieving peace in the future harder. Certainly, a larger war will spread Israel thin, especially when it has yet to achieve the eradication of Hamas in Gaza. However, Israel continues to have the military support of the United States. Israel has been fighting in Gaza for a year and there has been major destruction of Hamas brigades and a severe loss of fighters. The biggest problem for achieving its aims in Gaza is that Israel has no vision for an alternative governing force. The problem isn’t that Israeli forces are being spread thin, but that Israel needs a political strategy for a government framework that leads to Palestinian self-determination and has international and Palestinian buy-in. Without that, Gaza will be a constant threat and a constant military drain. Israel cannot achieve its aims in Gaza because it doesn’t have a political aim – it never did, and it went to war without one. And this will potentially be its Achilles’ heel. But Netanyahu probably doesn’t feel like he needs to seek any kind of political outcome because he can go to endless war, and yet still have much of the Western world on his side. Any American president can exert influence on Benjamin Netanyahu if he or she wants to. But none of them have thought it beneficial. Kamala Harris has less long-term baggage than Joe Biden in terms of wanting to give unconditional levels of support to Israel, but her party is internally divided - on one side there is strong support for Israel and on the other side, some are calling for an arms embargo. Those are a minority, but the Democratic voices calling to constrain Israel somehow are growing significantly. Trump is a wildcard. He talks big, but he doesn’t like America being dragged into wars. I think Donald Trump might exert more influence than Kamala Harris. He is more pro-Netanyahu, or at least pro-right-wing Israel, but he’s very much against dragging the US into war. Any US administration that is providing $10bn (£7.6bn) to help Israel’s military operations will have leverage, especially as Israel’s economy is suffering. The question is whether there is any US politician in a position of real authority who is willing to absorb the political cost domestically of using that leverage. At present there is not in either party. There is no Ronald Reagan or George HW Bush in prospect. They’re harder to pinpoint with every missile fired or air strike launched. I am very pessimistic about the prospects of de-escalation… most likely the perception within the Israel Defence Forces and at the political level within Netanayhu's war cabinet is that they have the momentum. In warfare, when one side believes it has the momentum against its adversary, you don't want to give it up, because you can continue to put pressure on your enemy. This conflict will not be won militarily by any actor involved. Ultimately, diplomacy is the only way towards stability. There are two obvious off-ramps. The first is for Israel to accept a ceasefire in Gaza that will pull back forces to agreed locations so that humanitarian aid can move and that allows for a new Palestinian governing authority that Palestinians, not Israelis or Americans, will choose. The second is for a ceasefire in Lebanon that will see Hezbollah cease rocket/missile attacks on Israel in return for Israel halting its airstrikes and ground incursions. I don’t think Netanyahu is looking for off-ramps. But the one potential off-ramp is if there were major concessions from Iran, a major turnaround in Iranian policy, starting with the nuclear programme but including the support for Hezbollah and Hamas. I can’t imagine it happening, but that would be an off-ramp. In Lebanon, the off-ramp is for a ceasefire and an agreement on new security arrangements in the south. I don’t think this option is available before the end of this year and while we’re awaiting a new US administration. There are no off-ramps here unless the US and other major Western governments make it their business to change the direction of events on the ground in the Middle East.

3356,2024-10-28 15:57:24.905000+00:00,/news/articles/cy7dkgz71x6o,"Satellite images analysed by BBC Verify show damage to a number of military sites in Iran from Israeli air strikes on Saturday. They include sites experts say were used for missile production and air defence, including one previously linked to Iran’s nuclear programme. Satellite imagery following the Israeli strikes shows damage to buildings at what experts say is a major weapons development and production facility at Parchin, about 30km (18.5 miles) east of Tehran. The site has been linked to rocket production according to experts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Comparing high-resolution satellite imagery taken on 9 September with an image captured on 27 October, it appears that at least four structures have been significantly damaged. One of these structures, known as Taleghan 2, has been previously linked to Iran’s nuclear programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)In 2016 the IAEA found evidence of uranium particles at the site, external, raising questions about banned nuclear activity there. Another site apparently targeted in the Israeli air strikes is at Khojir, about 20km north-west of Parchin. Fabian Hinz of the ISS says “Khojir is known as the area with the highest concentration of ballistic missile-related infrastructure within Iran. ”It was the site of a mysterious large explosion in 2020. Satellite photos show at least two buildings in the complex appear to have been severely damaged. Analysts from Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, concluded that damage to Iranian facilities believed to be linked to rocket fuel production at both Parchin and Khojir will ultimately undermine Iran’s ability to “fire another salvo of the scale necessary to breach Israeli air defences”. A military site at Shahroud, about 350km to the east of Tehran, has also sustained damage, according to satellite imagery taken after the Israeli strikes. Located in the northern province of Semnan, this area is significant because it’s been involved in the production of long-range missile components, according to Fabian Hinz of the IISS. Nearby is the Shahroud Space Centre, controlled by the Revolutionary Guards Corps, from which Iran launched a military satellite into space in 2020. Israel has claimed that it successfully targeted Iran’s aerial defence systems at number of locations but it’s difficult to confirm this with the satellite imagery available. We have obtained satellite imagery which appears to show damage to a site described by experts as a radar installation. It's located on Shah Nakhjir mountain close to the western city of Ilam, and Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Janes, a defence intelligence company, says this may have been a newly updated radar defence system. The site itself was established decades ago, but satellite pictures analysed by open source experts show it has undergone major renovation in recent years, external. We've also identified what appears to be damage to a storage unit at the Abadan Oil Refinery based in the south-western province of Khuzestan. However, we don’t know what caused it and there is likely to be damage in some areas across Iran caused by debris or misfiring defence systems. The New York Times cited Israeli officials , externalas saying that the Abadan oil refinery was one of the sites targeted in its air strikes on Saturday morning. Iranian authorities confirmed on Saturday that Khuzestan province had been targeted by Israel. Abadan oil refinery is the country’s largest, capable of producing 500,000 barrels a day, according to its chief executive, external. Satellite imagery isn't always conclusive in identifying damaged structures. For example, a photograph we have verified showing smoke rising near Hazrat Amir Brigade Air Defence base suggested it had been successfully targeted. But satellite imagery of the area captured on Sunday has too many shadows to confirm any damage to the site. Iran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April.

3357,2024-10-01 18:40:31.641000+00:00,/news/articles/c70w1j0l488o,"Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on Tuesday night. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. It was Iran’s second such attack on Israel this year, after it launched about 300 missiles and drones in April. Here's what we know so far. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the attack involved more than 180 missiles, which tallied with Iranian state media reports saying that about 200 missiles were launched. The US said the attack was “nearly twice the scope” of what happened in April. Sirens sounded as Israel’s entire 10 million population was told to head into bomb shelters at about 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday. Social media videos verified by the BBC showed missiles flying over the densely populated cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem less than 15 minutes later. Explosions could be heard overhead as air defences intercepted the incoming missiles. The footage also showed several missiles hitting areas around the Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency near Tel Aviv. “There were a small number of hits in the centre of Israel, and other hits in southern Israel,” said IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. “The majority of the incoming missiles were intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States. ”The Israeli military confirmed on Wednesday some of its air bases had been hit during the attack, but said no weapons, aircraft or critical infrastructure was damaged and the air force's operational abilities were not affected. Iranian state media cited the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as saying the missiles hit Nevatim, Hatzerim and Tel Nof airbases, as well as Israeli tanks in Netzarim - a reference to an Israeli military corridor in central Gaza - and gas installations in the southern city of Ashkelon. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran had for the first time used Fattah hypersonic missiles that it claimed ""cannot be intercepted"", as well as Emad and Qadr ballistic missiles. However, the IDF said the barrage did not include any hypersonic missiles, according to Israeli media. On Wednesday, the IDF said several air force bases were damaged in the missile attack, but that no aircraft were damaged, according to Israeli media reports. “Only administrative buildings and peripheral components were hit,” the IDF was quoted as saying, while adding that “upcoming missions remain unaffected"". The IDF also reportedly said that damage to infrastructure and property in civilian areas was “only minor” and was likely to have been caused by shrapnel from intercepted missiles. Just north of Tel Aviv on Wednesday, close to the Mossad’s headquarters, a BBC correspondent found several badly damaged cars and a pile of earth next to a road where a missile impact was said to have caused a crater between 8m and 10m deep. The nearby municipality of Hod HaSharon also said about 100 houses were damaged by a missile explosion and shrapnel. ""This was a very powerful impact with a huge risk of claiming human lives,"" the municipality said. And a video released by the IDF showed the head of its Home Front Command visiting a school that was hit by a missile in the Gedera area, external, just to the east of Ashkelon, causing extensive damage to a classroom. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service paramedics treated two people with light injuries from shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, as well as some people with minor injuries caused by falling as they moved to shelters. However, the Palestinian Civil Defence authority said a Palestinian man was killed when he was hit by a falling missile fragment in the West Bank city of Jericho. CCTV footage showed the rear half of a large, black missile plummeting directly on to a man as he walks along a road at night. It was not clear if the missile had been intercepted. The New York Times identified him as Sameh al-Asali, external, a 37-year-old Palestinian construction worker from Gaza who had been sheltering in Jericho since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October. The IDF has not provided details about how the missiles were shot down, besides saying that Israeli and US-led forces were involved and that Israeli air defences “operated impressively, with high rates of interception”. It also did not say exactly how many were intercepted, explaining that it wanted to avoid “giving Iran and Hezbollah information that will help them learn lessons”. The IDF claimed that 99% of the Iranian projectiles launched in April’s attack were intercepted. Israel has a sophisticated system of air defences, the best-known of which is the Iron Dome. It is designed to intercept short-range rockets of the sort fired by Hamas and Hezbollah. While it was used to defend against some elements of Iran's last attack in April, other elements of the country's ""layered"" defence systems probably did the bulk of the work on Tuesday. David’s Sling - a joint US-Israeli manufactured system - is used to intercept medium to long-range rockets, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles. And when it comes to long-range ballistic missiles, which fly outside the Earth’s atmosphere, Israel has the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors. The Pentagon said two US Navy destroyers deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean fired a dozen interceptors as part of the efforts to defend Israel, but that it was not known whether they took down any of the missiles. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said British forces had ""played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation”. But the BBC understands that British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian missiles. Verified footage also showed missile interceptions over the Jordanian capital, Amman. The Arab kingdom’s forces also shot down a number of missiles during Iran's last attack in April. How do Israel's air defence systems work? The IRGC said in a statement that the missile barrage was retaliation for what it called the ""violation of Iran’s sovereignty and the martyrdom” of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed by an explosion in Tehran in July that Iranian officials blamed on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim. The statement described the barrage as having been ""in line with the legitimate right of the nation to defend itself”. It also said the attack was in response to the Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, the operations commander of the IRGC’s overseas arm, the Quds Force. A senior Iranian official told Reuters news agency the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had personally given the order for Tuesday's missile attack. The escalation also came hours after Israeli troops began an invasion of southern Lebanon to remove what the military said were ""Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages that posed a threat to residents of northern Israel. Israel has gone on the offensive against the Shia Islamist political and military organisation after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war with Hamas in Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran and designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and others. Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and seeks its eradication. It has spent years building a network of armed groups across the Middle East, known as the “Axis of Resistance”, which are opposed to Israel and the US. Israel believes that Iran poses an existential threat and has spent years engaged in a shadow war with Iran that has is now increasingly out in the open. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday night that Iran’s missile attack “failed”, having been “thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defence array”. “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it,” he added. “The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies. ”Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also vowed vengeance. ""Iran has not learned a simple lesson - those who attack the state of Israel pay a heavy price,"" he said in a statement. US President Joe Biden reaffirmed US support for Israel after the missile attack, describing it as ""defeated and ineffective"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin also condemned what he called ""this outrageous act of aggression by Iran"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK stood with Israel and recognised her ""right to self-defence"". France and Japan also condemned Iran's attack, but also called on all parties to avoid further escalation. The US told Israel before the attack that it had intelligence indicating that Iran was preparing to launch ballistic missiles imminently, which allowed the IDF to warn Israeli civilians to be prepared to seek shelter. However, US officials said after the attack that they had received no warning from the Iranian government. Iran’s mission to the UN also said in a statement: “No notice was given to the United States prior to our response. ”The Wall Street Journal citing Arab officials in the region as saying that Iran “telegraphed” to Arab countries on Monday night that it was going to launch an attack similar in scale to April’s, external. The officials also said Israel had sent clear messages back to Iran that it would respond to any attack on Israeli territory with a strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear or oil facilities. The IDF’s Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said: “We will choose when to exact the price and demonstrate our precise and surprising offensive capabilities, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon. ""Axos cited Israeli officials as saying that Israel’s response would be “significant” and that it could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites, external. Some analysts suggested that Iran’s nuclear facilities could also be targeted. President Biden said the US was “fully supportive of Israel” and that he would discuss a response with Israel’s prime minister. But Biden made clear that he saw any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites as off limits. Asked by reporters whether he would support such an attack, he said: ""The answer is no. ""The IRGC warned that Iran’s response would be ""crushing"" if Israel dared to retaliate.

3358,2024-11-26 22:57:10.875000+00:00,/news/articles/cx2d3gj9ewxo,"A ceasefire deal to end 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has taken effect. The US and France said the agreement would “cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organisations operating from Lebanon”. Hezbollah has been given 60 days to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon while Israeli forces must withdraw from the area over the same period. This is what we know about the ceasefire from the agreement itself and official briefings. Jeremy Bowen: Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for Middle EastDisplaced Lebanese head for homes as fragile truce appears to holdWhat we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire dealWatch: 'Everything was gone' - Beirut resident returning home US President Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday night that it was ""designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities”. The 13-point agreement between the governments of Israel and Lebanon, external - and not Hezbollah - also says both countries are “prepared to take steps to promote conditions for a permanent and comprehensive solution”. It states that the Lebanese government will ""prevent Hezbollah and all other armed groups in the territory of Lebanon from carrying out any operations against Israel"". Israel, meanwhile, will ""not carry out any offensive military operations against Lebanese targets, including civilian, military, or other state targets, in the territory of Lebanon”. The basis of the deal, it notes, is the ""full implementation, without violation"" of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last war in 2006. The resolution required, among other things, Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the area between the Blue Line - the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Israel said that was never implemented, allowing Hezbollah to build extensive infrastructure in the area, while Lebanon said Israel’s violations included military flights over its territory. The agreement also notes that the resolution reaffirmed previous Security Council calls for the ""disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon"". Biden declared that “Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon will not be allowed to be rebuilt”. The ceasefire agreement says Israeli forces will move south of the Blue Line “in a phased manner” within 60 days. The Lebanese army’s troops will deploy “in parallel” to the positions. A senior US official said this was ""to prevent any vacuums from being formed"". Without mentioning Hezbollah, the agreement says the Lebanese army will “dismantle all infrastructure, and military positions, and confiscate all unauthorised arms"" in what it calls the Southern Litani Area, as well as stop the unauthorised entry of weapons into Lebanon and dismantle any unauthorised weapons production facilities. The agreement also says that “Lebanon’s official military and security forces, infrastructure and weaponry will be the only armed groups, arms, and related material deployed” in the Southern Litani Area. The only exception is the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, Unifil, which has about 10,000 troops. The US official said that meant Hezbollah would have to pull back its fighters and “all their heavy weaponry” to the north of the area. A map of the Southern Litani Area shows that it extends north of the river in some locations, notably around the village of Yohmor, and extends to Hasbaya and Chebaa in the east. A total of 10,000 Lebanese army troops will eventually be deployed to the south, according to the agreement. However, questions remain about the troops’ role in enforcing the ceasefire, and whether they would confront Hezbollah if needed, which would have the potential to exacerbate tensions in a country where sectarian divisions run deep. The Lebanese army has also said it does not have the resources - money, manpower and equipment - to fulfil its obligations, although the agreement says the US and France will work with the international community to provide support and improve its capabilities. Many Western officials say Hezbollah has been weakened and that this is the moment for the Lebanese government to re-establish control over all the country's territory. The US and France will join the existing Tripartite Mechanism involving Unifil, the Israeli military and Lebanese army that was set up to help reach agreements on contentious issues. The ceasefire agreement says the US will chair the “reformulated and enhanced” mechanism, which will “monitor, verify and assist in ensuring enforcement” of both sides' commitments. Israel and Lebanon will be expected to report any alleged violations to the mechanism. “What this means is that the United States, both through diplomats and military personnel, is going to be receiving any complaints by either side,” the senior US official said. “Information can flow on a real time basis to make sure that any potential violations are deterred. ”The official also stressed that “there will be no US combat troops in the area”. The agreement states that “these commitments do not preclude either Israel or Lebanon from exercising their inherent right of self-defence, consistent with international law”. Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Tuesday night that Israel would “maintain full freedom of military action” in Lebanon “with the United States' full understanding”. “If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck carrying rockets, we will attack,” he asserted. Biden supported that view, telling reporters: ""If Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defence consistent with international law. ""But Lebanese officials said they would oppose any violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty.",What we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal,What we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2d3gj9ewxo,articles/article_3358.txt,results/article_3358.txt.json
3359,2024-10-26 09:21:08.034000+00:00,/news/articles/cgr0yvrx4qpo,"Israel carried out what it described as “precise and targeted” airstrikes on Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for the barrage of strikes launched by Tehran against Israel earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted military sites in several regions, with subsequent reports suggesting an Iranian missile production site had been hit. One civilian and four soldiers were killed in the attacks, the Iranian military said. It marks the latest in a series of attacks between the two regional foes that for months have raised fears of an all-out  war. Here’s what we know. At around 02:15 on Saturday (22:45 GMT on Friday), Iranian media reported explosions in and around the capital, Tehran. Video uploaded to social media, and verified by the BBC, showed projectiles in the sky over the city, while residents in some areas reported hearing loud booms. The IDF's strikes, which came in several waves over a three-hour period, involved scores of aircraft, including jets and drones. Targets comprised Iran’s air defences, missile and drone production, and launch facilities. Two researchers, analysing satellite imagery, told Reuters news agency that Israel had struck buildings in Parchin, a military complex near Tehran, and may have ""significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv - said Israel had ""severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles"". ""This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him,"" he added. The White House described the strikes as an ""exercise of self-defence"". A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a ""targeted and proportional"" response. They also said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets President Joe Biden had urged Israel not to hit. Iran has largely played down the impact of the strikes - which hit sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces - saying most missiles were intercepted and those that were not caused ""limited damage"". BBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, in a measured response, said the attacks should not be ""exaggerated or downplayed"". ""It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime,"" he said on Sunday, ""and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country. ""Meanwhile, the IDF said it had hit around 20 targets, with Netanyahu describing the attack as ""precise and powerful"" and having ""achieved its goals"". The Iranian military confirmed that four soldiers had died - and state news agencies reported the death of one civilian.  Iran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with. In April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on an Iranian embassy compound, external in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to. Later, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment. In late September, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut. On October 1, Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan. This latest attack on Iran is Israel's response to that. Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran?  Netanyahu's office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond. ""Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,"" the prime minister's spokesperson said. Still, the strikes were more limited than some had been expecting. The IDF said in a statement that it is ""focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation"". A senior US official said ""this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran"". Iran’s foreign ministry said it was ""entitled and obligated to defend itself"" and described the attack as a violation of international law. But it also said that Tehran recognises its ""responsibilities towards regional peace and security"". Images published by Iranian state media over the weekend showed life continuing in relative normality - with busy streets, people exercising in parks, and fruit and vegetable markets open as usual. Iran closed its airspace for a few hours, but it later reopened. There are, however, signs that the Iranian government is keen to play down the impact of the attacks. The IRGC has announced that it is a criminal offense to send “images or news” related to the attack to outlets that it deems ""Israel-affiliated"" or ""hostile”. Usually, Iran refers to Western media as hostile. Iranian media reported over the weekend that Tehran's Prosecutor Office has filed charges against an unnamed website for “covering issues counter to national security"".  US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Israel’s response “avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran's attack against Israel that targeted Israel's most populous city"". But Washington’s aim, he added, is “to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself, but urged all sides to “show restraint” and called for Iran not to respond. Saudi Arabia condemned the attack, and warned against any action that ""threatens the security and the stability” of the region. Egypt's foreign ministry echoed those concerns, saying it was “gravely concerned” by the strikes. Hamas described them as ""a flagrant violation of Iranian sovereignty, and an escalation that targets the security of the region and the safety of its peoples"".

3360,2024-09-17 19:25:54.747000+00:00,/news/articles/cz04m913m49o,"At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured, many seriously, after communication devices, some used by the armed group Hezbollah, dramatically exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the latest round of blasts on Wednesday, exploding walkie-talkies killed 20 and injured at least 450 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. The explosions occurred in the vicinity of a large crowd that had gathered for the funerals of four victims of Tuesday's simultaneous pager blasts, which killed at least 12 people and injured nearly 3,000. BBC teams in the city reported chaotic scenes in which ambulances struggled to reach the injured, while locals became suspicious of anyone using a phone. The explosions deepened unease in Lebanese society, coming a day after the apparently similar and highly sophisticated attack targeting thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members. The militant group blamed its adversary, Israel. Israeli officials have so far declined to comment. Two firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility, with the Taiwanese government saying the different parts of the pagers were not from Taiwan. ""The components are low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,"" Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said.  A Japanese company which apparently makes the walkie-talkies said it stopped producing that model 10 years ago. Here is what we know so far.  The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time (13:30 BST) on Tuesday. Witnesses reported seeing smoke coming from people's pockets, before seeing small explosions that sounded like fireworks and gunshots. Citing US officials, the New York Times said that the pagers received messages that appeared to be coming from Hezbollah's leadership before detonating. The messages instead appeared to trigger the devices, the outlet reported. Explosions continued for around an hour after the initial blasts, the Reuters news agency reported. Soon after, scores of people began arriving at hospitals across Lebanon, with witnesses reporting mass confusion in emergency departments. Similar scenes played out across the country in another round of blasts on Wednesday, at around 17:00 local time (15:00 BST). Reports suggest it was walkie-talkies that were blown up, devices that were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, according to a security source speaking to Reuters news agency. At least one explosion was close to a funeral being held in Beirut for some of the victims of Tuesday's attack, creating panic among those near the procession. Twenty people have been killed and at least 450 injured, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Follow live updates on this storyVideo captures Beirut skyline as devices explode across cityFrom Taiwan to Hungary, a complex picture emerges of the pagers' originsNo electronic equipment considered safe after Lebanon device attacksHezbollah and its conflict with Israel explained Details about the walkie-talkies detonated in Wednesday's explosions are still coming to light. Footage shot in the aftermath showed destroyed devices bearing the brand Icom, a Japanese company. A statement from the firm describes the IC-V82 model as a handheld radio which was exported to the Middle East from 2004 to 2014 and has not been shipped since then. Icom said production on that model stopped 10 years ago. The manufacturing of the batteries has also stopped, it says. The company says it is not possible to confirm whether the IC-V82s that exploded in yesterday's attacks were shipped directly from Icom, or via a distributor. It said any products for overseas markets were sold only to the firm’s authorised distributors. But the models may not even be from Icom. Earlier, a sales executive at the US subsidiary of Icom told AP news agency that the devices which exploded in Lebanon appeared to be a knock-off product – adding it was easy to find counterfeit versions of the product online. The pagers that exploded on Tuesday were a new brand that the group had not used before, one Hezbollah operative told AP. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that around 5,000 pagers were brought into the country about five months ago.   Labels seen on fragments of exploded pagers point to a pager model called the Rugged Pager AR-924. But its Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo has denied any involvement with the explosions. When the BBC visited Gold Apollo on Wednesday local police were searching the company's offices, inspecting documents and questioning staff. Taiwan pager maker stunned by link to Lebanon attacksThe founder, Hsu Ching-Kuang, said his company had signed an agreement with a Hungarian-based company - BAC - to manufacture the devices and use his company's name. He added that money transfers from them had been ""very strange"", without elaborating. BBC Verify has accessed BAC’s company records, which reveal it was first incorporated in 2022. Its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono told NBC that she knew nothing about the explosions. “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong,"" she said. The Hungarian government said the company had ""no manufacturing or operational site"" in the country. Unnamed US and Israeli officials told Axios that detonating the pagers all at once was initially planned as the opening move in an ""all-out"" offensive against Hezbollah. But in recent days Israel became concerned Hezbollah had become aware of the plan - so they were set off early. Israeli officials have not commented on the allegations, but most analysts agree that it seems likely it is behind the attack. Prof Simon Mabon, chair in International Relations at Lancaster University, told the BBC: ""We know that Israel has a precedent of using technology to track its target"" - but he called the scale of this attack ""unprecedented"". Lina Khatib, from the UK-based Chatham House, said the attack suggested that Israel has ""deeply"" infiltrated Hezbollah's ""communications network"". In its statement accusing Israel of being behind the attacks, Hezbollah said it held the country ""fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians"". Hezbollah has relied heavily on pagers as a low-tech means of communications to try to evade location-tracking by Israel. Pagers are wireless telecommunications devices that receive and display alphanumeric or voice messages. They are much harder to track than mobile phones, which have long since been abandoned as simply too vulnerable, as Israel’s assassination of the Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash demonstrated as long ago as 1996, when his phone exploded in his hand. In February, Hassan Nasrallah directed Hezbollah fighters to get rid of their phones, saying they had been infiltrated by Israeli intelligence. He told his forces to break, bury or lock their phones in an iron box. Experts now say the directive, issued during a live televised address, may have forewarned Israeli intelligence operatives that the group would be seeking a new - likely lower tech - method of communications.  A source close to Hezbollah told AFP news agency that two of those killed in Tuesday's attack were the sons of two Hezbollah MPs. They also said the daughter of a Hezbollah member was killed. Among the injured was Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Reports in Iranian media said his injuries were minor. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was not hurt in the explosions, Reuters reported quoting a source. Lebanese Public Health Minister Firass Abiad said damage to the hands and face made up the majority of injuries. The victims presenting to emergency rooms were a variety of ages, from the old to the very young, some wearing civilian clothes, he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Outside of Lebanon, 14 people were injured in similar blasts in neighbouring Syria, according to UK-based campaign group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hezbollah is allied with Israel's arch-nemesis in the region, Iran. The group is part of Tehran's Axis of Resistance and has been engaged in a low-level war with Israel for months, frequently exchanging rocket and missile fire across Israel's northern border. Entire communities have been displaced from both sides. The blasts came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. While visiting an Israeli airbase on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the country was ""opening a new phase in the war"" and and the ""centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces"". Despite the ongoing tensions, observers say that until now both sides have aimed to contain hostilities without crossing the line into full-scale war. But there are fears that the situation could spiral out of control.

3361,2024-11-14 01:14:07.269000+00:00,/news/articles/c98d9nrg1rgo,"Some football fans attending the European Nations League match in Paris between France and Israel whistled and booed as the Israeli anthem played at the start of the game. Thursday's match was played in front of scant crowds and heavy security a week after violence in Amsterdam between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and visiting Israeli fans. Despite fears of a repeat of the Amsterdam violence, there were just a few brief scuffles in the stands during the first half of the game, which ended in a 0-0 draw. President Emmanuel Macron - who attended the match with Prime Minister Michel Barnier - said beforehand that France would not give in to antisemitism. Thousands of police were deployed to ensure security at the Stade de France in the northern Paris suburbs and on public transport, while an elite anti-terrorist police unit protected the visiting Israeli squad. A reporter for France's AFP news agency witnessed stewards intervening to stop clashes in the stands between rival fans.   According to Reuters news agency, some 100 Israel fans defied travel warnings from their government and sat in a corner of the 80,000-capacity stadium, which was barely a fifth full. Waving yellow balloons, they chanted ""Free the Hostages"" in reference to Israelis held in Gaza by Hamas militants, the agency reports. Before the match, several hundred demonstrators gathered in a square near the stadium to wave Palestinian, Lebanese and Algerian flags in protest at the war in Gaza. ""We don’t play with genocide,"" one banner read. Israel has denied allegations of genocide as baseless and grossly distorted. It launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Politicians across Europe decried a “return of antisemitism” after Israeli fans were chased through the streets of Amsterdam.  Maccabi fans were themselves involved in vandalism, tearing down a Palestinian flag, attacking a taxi and chanting anti-Arab slogans, according to city authorities. They were then targeted by “small groups of rioters… on foot, by scooter or car”, the city said in a 12-page report. Violence between Israel and its neighbours in the Middle East has the potential to spread to Europe. France, Belgium and the Netherlands all have large Muslim populations of North African origin and they live beside far smaller Jewish populations, who in the main identify strongly with Israel. To express solidarity with European Jews after Amsterdam, President Emmanuel Macron attended Thursday’s match along with Prime Minister Michel Barnier and former presidents François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Supporters were told to expect identity checks ahead of the game while bars and restaurants in the area were told to close from the afternoon. The Stade de France was the scene of a dangerous breakdown in law and order at a Uefa Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in 2022.  However since then the Rugby World Cup and Paris Olympics have both been peacefully staged there. France’s far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party – which sides with Palestinians and Lebanese in the conflicts with Israel – called for Thursday’s match to be cancelled, or at least for Macron to refuse to attend. New arrests in Amsterdam over riots after Maccabi match“We do not want our head of state honouring a country that commits genocide,” said LFI deputy David Guiraud. But Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said it was out of the question to cancel or relocate the match. “France does not give way to those who sow hatred,” he said. France and Israel are in the same group in the Uefa competition, alongside Italy and Belgium. In their first leg – played in Budapest – France beat Israel 4-1. Pre-match tensions were already in evidence on the eve of the match after a pro-Israeli “gala” event was given the go-ahead in Paris, which the far-right Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich was at one point expected to attend – although it was later thought his “presence” would be by video-link. Several thousand pro-Palestinian and anti-racist organisations also staged protests in the capital to coincide with the event. Clashes broke out and police used tear gas as protesters targeted a McDonald's on the Boulevard Montmartre. Relations between Macron and Benyamin Netanyahu have come under severe strain in recent weeks, after Macron accused the Israeli prime minister of “spreading barbarism” in Gaza and Lebanon. French Jews were also upset when Macron was quoted as saying that Netanyahu should accept United Nations calls for a ceasefire because “his country was itself created by a decision of the UN”. This was interpreted in Israel as an insult to Jews who had lost their lives in their country’s war of independence. France in turn was angered when two French officials were briefly detained by Israeli authorities at a holy site in East Jerusalem that is under French administration. Macron has been described as pursuing a zigzag in his approach to the Middle East, as in many other domains, flipflopping inconsistently between outspoken statements of support for Israel and then its Arab neighbours.",Whistles and boos at France-Israel football match,Whistles and boos at France-Israel football match,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98d9nrg1rgo,articles/article_3361.txt,results/article_3361.txt.json
3362,2024-09-27 23:13:35.085000+00:00,/news/articles/c1wnp0vln19o,"Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, after Israel said it had killed the 64-year-old in an airstrike on Beirut. Nasrallah, the former leader of Lebanon's militant Shia Islamist movement, was one of the best known and most influential figures in the Middle East. Prior to his death, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel. And on Saturday, Israeli military said they killed Nasrallah in a strike on the Lebanese capital. Nasrallah was a shadowy figure with close personal links to Iran who played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today. He was revered by the group's supporters. Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and other countries, helped train fighters from the Palestinian armed group Hamas, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen, and obtained missiles and rockets from Iran for use against Israel.

Born in 1960, Hassan Nasrallah grew up in Beirut's eastern Bourj Hammoud neighbourhood, where his father Abdul Karim ran a small greengrocers. He was the eldest of nine children. He joined the Amal movement, then a Shia militia, after Lebanon descended into civil war in 1975. After a short spell in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf to attend a Shia seminary he rejoined Amal in Lebanon before he and others split from the group in 1982, shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants. The new group, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah. In 1985, Hezbollah officially announced its establishment by publishing an ""open letter"" that identified the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's principal enemies and called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it said was occupying Muslim lands. Nasrallah worked his way up through Hezbollah's ranks as the organisation grew. He said that after serving as a fighter he became its director in Baalbek, then the whole Bekaa region, followed by Beirut. He became leader of Hezbollah in 1992 at the age of 32, after his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi was assassinated in an Israeli helicopter strike. One of his first actions was to retaliate to the killing of Musawi. He ordered rocket attacks into northern Israel that killed a girl, an Israeli security officer at the Israeli embassy in Turkey was killed by a car bomb, and a suicide bomber struck the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people. Nasrallah also managed a low-intensity war with Israeli forces that ended with their withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, though he suffered a personal loss when his eldest son Hadi was killed in a firefight with Israeli troops. Following the withdrawal, Nasrallah proclaimed that Hezbollah had achieved the first Arab victory against Israel. He also vowed that Hezbollah would not disarm, saying that it considered that ""all Lebanese territory must be restored"", including the Shebaa Farms area. There was relative calm until 2006, when Hezbollah militants launched a cross-border attack in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped, triggering a massive Israeli response. Israeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah strongholds in the south and in Beirut's southern suburbs, while Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets at Israel. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day conflict, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians. Nasrallah's home and offices were targeted by Israel warplanes, but he survived unscathed. In 2009, Nasrallah issued a new political manifesto that sought to highlight Hezbollah's ""political vision"". It dropped the reference to an Islamic republic found in the 1985 document, but maintained a tough line against Israel and the US and reiterated that Hezbollah needed to keep its weapons despite a UN resolution banning them in southern Lebanon. ""People evolve. The whole world changed over the past 24 years. Lebanon changed. The world order changed,"" Nasrallah said. Four years later, Nasrallah declared that Hezbollah was entering ""a completely new phase"" of its existence by sending fighters into Syria to help its Iran-backed ally, President Bashar al-Assad, put down a rebellion. ""It is our battle, and we are up to it,"" he said. Lebanese Sunni leaders accused Hezbollah of dragging the country into Syria's war and sectarian tensions worsened dramatically. In 2019, a deep economic crisis in Lebanon triggered mass protests against a political elite long accused of corruption, waste, mismanagement and negligence. Nasrallah initially expressed sympathy with the calls for reforms, but his attitude changed as the protesters began demanding for a complete overhaul of the political system. On 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen that triggered the war in Gaza - previously sporadic fighting between Hezbollah and Israel escalated. Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. In a speech in November, Nasrallah said the Hamas attack had been ""100% Palestinian in terms of both decision and execution"" but that the firing between his group and Israel was ""very important and significant"". The group launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retaliated with air strikes and tank and artillery fire against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. In his most recent speech, Nasrallah blamed Israel for detonating thousands of pagers and radio handsets used by Hezbollah members, which killed 39 people and wounded thousands more, and said it had ""crossed all red lines"". He acknowledged the group had suffered an ""unprecedented blow"". Shortly afterwards Israel dramatically escalated attacks on Hezbollah, launching waves of bombing that killed nearly 800 people.",Who was Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah?,Who was Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah?,"israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wnp0vln19o,articles/article_3362.txt,results/article_3362.txt.json
3363,2024-10-19 16:39:26.192000+00:00,/news/articles/c04p04lq27ko,"Two Hamas officials told the BBC discussions to choose a successor for the group's leader Yahya Sinwar, whose killing was confirmed on Thursday, will begin very soon. The officials said that Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar's deputy and the group's most senior official outside Gaza, is considered a strong candidate. Al-Hayya, who is based in Qatar, currently leads the Hamas delegation in ceasefire talks between the group and Israel, and possesses a deep knowledge, connection and understanding of the situation in Gaza. On Monday, a Hamas official told the BBC that the movement is likely to keep the identity of its new leader secret for security reasons. The movement did the same thing in 2003 following the assassination of then Hamas chief, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, by Israel and that of his successor, Dr Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi. Hamas intends to elect a new leader in March of next year but until then it will be run by a five-member committee. The committee will be made up of Khalil al-Hayya, Khaled Meshaal, Zaher Jabarin, Muhammad Darwish, head of the Shura Council, and a fifth individual whose identity remains undisclosed. The official indicated that Khalil al-Hayya has assumed responsibility for most political and foreign affairs in addition to his direct oversight of Gaza-related matters and is effectively the acting head of the movement. The official added that Hamas had been surprised by the way Yahya Sinwar had been killed last week as their understanding had been that he was in a much more secure location at the time of his assassination. Sinwar's death came just two months after the killing of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. A senior Hamas official had described Sinwar as the architect of the 7 October attacks, emphasising that his appointment was intended as a bold message of defiance against Israel. Since July, ceasefire negotiations have stalled, and many believe that Sinwar's leadership was a significant obstacle to any ceasefire deal. Despite the killing of Sinwar, a senior Hamas official reiterated to the BBC that the movement's conditions for accepting a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages have not changed. Hamas continues to demand a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, an end to hostilities, the transfer of humanitarian aid, and the reconstruction of the war-torn territory - conditions that Israel has categorically rejected, insisting that Hamas must surrender. When questioned about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for Hamas to give up its weapons and surrender, officials from the movement responded: “It is impossible for us to surrender. ""We are fighting for the freedom of our people, and we will not accept surrender. We will fight until the last bullet and the last soldier, just as Sinwar did. ”The assassination of Sinwar was one of the most significant losses for the organisation in decades. However, despite the challenges of replacing him, Hamas has a history of enduring leadership losses since the 1990s. While Israel has succeeded in killing most of Hamas’s leaders and founders, the movement has proven resilient in its capacity to find new ones. Amid this crisis, questions linger regarding the fate of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and who will be responsible for their safety and protection. On Monday the Hamas official told the BBC that the group still had the ability to hold the hostages. In this context, Mohammed Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar’s brother, has emerged as a pivotal figure. He is believed to be leading the remaining armed groups of Hamas and may play a crucial role in shaping the future of the movement in Gaza.",Who will lead Hamas after killing of Yahya Sinwar?,Who will lead Hamas after killing of Yahya Sinwar?,"israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04p04lq27ko,articles/article_3363.txt,results/article_3363.txt.json
3364,2024-10-14 20:52:37.927000+00:00,/news/articles/c39le0dp4p7o,"The Pentagon has confirmed it is sending a high-altitude anti-missile system operated by US troops to Israel. Officials say the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) battery will bolster Israeli air defences after Iran’s missile attack on the country earlier this month. President Joe Biden has said it is meant ""to defend Israel"", which is still expected to retaliate against an Iranian strike involving more than 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel on 1 October. The move has become the focus of attention as it involves putting American boots on the ground in Israel. There are already a small number of US forces in the country - but this new deployment of about 100 troops is significant as it signals further US entanglement in the expanding regional war. It is also being scoured for clues as to what it means about the effectiveness of Israel’s missile defences as the crisis grows. Israel has yet to launch its retaliation for Iran’s attack, which will be ""lethal, precise and above all, surprising"" according to Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Tehran said it fired on Israel because it assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, in Beirut. Follow live updates on this storyAnalysing footage from the Gaza strikesWatch: ‘I say bye to my kids, in case we don’t wake up’ – two Gazans film a year under attack by IsraelAnalysis: Drone attack on Israel puts spotlight on Iron Dome's limitationsGaza Strip in maps: How a year of war has drastically changed life in the territory The Pentagon said an advance team and components needed for the battery arrived in Israel on Monday – with further personnel and parts to follow in the coming days. The battery will be operational in the “near future”, a statement said. Israeli journalist Avi Scharf, who routinely monitors flight tracking data, said two C-17 US military transporters flew from Alabama to the Israeli Air Force's Nevatim base overnight, likely carrying Thaad equipment. It’s still unclear whether the Thaad deployment is part of US contingency planning to bridge gaps identified in Israel’s aerial defences, or whether it points to growing concerns in Washington of a more forceful Israeli strike on Iran. President Biden has opposed any attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, as well as on its oil or energy infrastructure, amid fears that it would trigger a spiralling conflict and affect the global economy. Whatever the background to the decision, it signals a further need by Israel for US defence assistance amid the expanding Middle East war. Ballistic missiles like the Fattah-1used by Iran earlier this month are fired upwards into the Earth’s atmosphere, where they change trajectory and descend towards their target. One of their military advantages is their immense speed compared with cruise missiles or drones. The Thaad system is highly effective against ballistic missiles, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the biggest US arms maker. Raytheon, another American weapons firm, builds its advanced radar. The system counts six truck-mounted launchers, with eight interceptors on each launcher. It costs about $1bn (£766m) a battery and requires a crew of about 100 to operate it. Thaad is much sought after including by Ukraine to counter Russian missile attacks. Saudi Arabia has orders in for it, and reportedly wanted more as part of an American weapons bonanza in return for officially recognising Israel: a so-called ""normalisation"" deal which was largely derailed after the 7 October attack by Hamas. Iran’s 1 October strikes on Israel killed one man in Jericho in the occupied West Bank, who was hit by part of a missile that was apparently shot down. Israel has a much vaunted aerial defence system, developed with the US, including Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 exo-atmospheric missiles. These fly at hypersonic speed and can shoot down ballistic missiles in space. The system’s Israeli designers said Arrow ""performed as expected"" with ""wonderful"" results against the Iranian strike. The US supported the defensive operation, firing interceptors from two naval destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, alongside support from some European and Arab countries. Washington presented the Iranian strike as ""defeated and ineffective"". But damage on the ground told a less emphatic picture. Satellite images showed damage at the Nevatim base, which houses F-35 fighter planes, including craters on a runway and taxiway. Decker Eveleth from the Washington-based Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) said the images showed 32 impact points, including multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers. ""Some F-35s got really lucky,"" Mr Eveleth posted on X. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that it was still unclear whether damage was caused directly by missiles or interception shrapnel. There were other direct impacts, including in Tel Aviv. One missile reportedly blew a 30ft (nine metre) deep crater in a densely populated area close to the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency. Politically, the Thaad announcement is couched in terms of the Biden administration’s ""ironclad"" support for Israel’s defence. The US has sent more than 50,000 tonnes worth of weapons to Israel in the last year, according to Israeli figures. But it also highlights some of the policy contortions carried out by Washington: first trying to pressure Israel and its adversaries not to escalate the war, instead urging diplomacy. When that has failed the White House has then firmly backed its Israeli ally’s decisions while moving to shield it diplomatically and militarily. The Iranian missile strikes followed Israel’s assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh (a negotiator in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks), Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Israeli air strikes in densely populated parts of Beirut and its ground invasion of Lebanon. Israel said it has been striking against Hezbollah’s leadership and destroying its vast missile stores due to 11 months of cross-border rocket fire into Israel. It argues only military pressure and degrading Hezbollah’s capabilities will ensure 60,000 Israelis can return to their homes in northern Israel. The Pentagon describes the Thaad deployment as part of ""the broader adjustments the US military has made in recent months"" to support Israel and defend American personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups. It says a Thaad was deployed in southern Israel for an exercise in 2019, the last and only time it was known to be there. A US military deployment to Israel outside of drills is extremely rare, given Israel's own capabilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned on Sunday that the US was putting the lives of its troops ""at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel"".",Why the US is sending Israel a powerful Thaad anti-missile system,Why the US is sending Israel a powerful Thaad anti-missile system,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c39le0dp4p7o,articles/article_3364.txt,results/article_3364.txt.json
3365,2024-12-03 22:16:23.808000+00:00,/news/articles/c5yx56ep165o,"Listen to Fergal read this articleEvery single person in his platoon knew someone who was killed. Yuval Green, 26, knew at least three. He was a reservist, a medic in the paratroops of the Israel Defence Forces, when he heard the first news of the 7 October Hamas attack. “Israel is a small country. Everyone knows each other,” he says. In several days of violence,1,200 people were killed, and 251 more abducted into Gaza. Ninety-seven hostages remain in Gaza, and around half of them are believed to be alive. Yuval immediately answered his country’s call to arms. It was a mission to defend Israelis. He recalls the horror of entering devastated Jewish communities near the Gaza border. “You're seeing… dead bodies on the streets, seeing cars punctured by bullets. ”Back then, there was no doubt about reporting for duty. The country was under attack. The hostages had to be brought home. Then came the fighting in Gaza itself. Things seen that could not be unseen. Like the night he saw cats eating human remains in the roadway. “Start to imagine, like an apocalypse. You look to your right, you look to your left, all you see is destroyed buildings, buildings that are damaged by fire, by missiles, everything. That's Gaza right now. ”One year on, the young man who reported for duty on 7 October is refusing to fight. Yuval is the co-organiser of a public letter signed by more than 165 - at the latest count - Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reservists, and a smaller number of permanent soldiers, refusing to serve, or threatening to refuse, unless the hostages are returned - something that would require a ceasefire deal with Hamas. In a country still traumatised by the worst violence in its history, those refusing for reasons of conscience are a minority in a military that includes around 465,000 reservists. There is another factor in play for some other IDF reservists: exhaustion.  According to Israeli media reports, a growing number are failing to report for duty. The Times of Israel newspaper and several other outlets quoted military sources as saying that there was a drop of between 15% to 25% of troops showing up, mainly due to burnout with the long periods of service required of them. Even if there is not widespread public support for those refusing to serve because of reasons of conscience, there is evidence that some of the key demands of those who signed the refusal letter are shared by a growing number of Israelis. A recent opinion poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) indicated that among Jewish Israelis 45% wanted the war to end - with a ceasefire to bring the hostages home - against 43% who wanted the IDF to fight on to destroy Hamas. Significantly, the IDI poll also suggests that the sense of solidarity which marked the opening days of the war as the country reeled from the trauma of 7 October has been overtaken by the revival of political divisions: only 26% of Israelis believe there is now a sense of togetherness, while 44% say there is not. At least part of this has to do with a feeling often expressed, especially among those on the left of the political divide, that the war is being prolonged at the behest of far-right parties whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to remain in power. Even the former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanhayu’s Likud Party, dismissed by the prime minister last month, cited the failure to return the hostages as one of the key disagreements with his boss. “There is and will not be any atonement for abandoning the captives,” he said. “It will be a mark of Cain on the forehead of Israeli society and those leading this mistaken path. ”Netanyahu, who along with Gallant is facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, has repeatedly denied this and stressed his commitment to freeing the hostages. The seeds of Yuval’s refusal lie back in the days soon after the war began. Then the deputy speaker of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), Nissim Vaturi, called for the Gaza Strip to be “erased from the face of the Earth”. Prominent rabbi Eliyahu Mali, referring generally to Palestinians in Gaza, said: “If you don’t kill them, they’ll kill you. ” The rabbi stressed soldiers should only do what the army orders, and that the state law did not allow for the killing of the civilian population. But the language - by no means restricted to the two examples above - worried Yuval. “People were speaking about killing the entire population of Gaza, as if it was some type of an academic idea that makes sense… And with this atmosphere, soldiers are entering Gaza just a month after their friends were butchered, hearing about soldiers dying every day. And soldiers do a lot of things. ”There have been social media posts from soldiers in Gaza abusing prisoners, destroying property, and mocking Palestinians, including numerous examples of soldiers posing with people’s possessions - including womens’ dresses and underwear. “I was trying to fight that at the time as much as I could,” says Yuval. “There was a lot of dehumanising, a vengeful atmosphere. ” His personal turning point came with an order he could not obey. “They told us to burn down a house, and I went to my commander and asked him: ‘Why are we doing that?’ And the answers he gave me were just not good enough. I wasn't willing to burn down a house without reasons that make sense, without knowing that this serves a certain military purpose, or any type of purpose. So I said no and left. ”That was his last day in Gaza. In response, the IDF told me that its actions were “based on military necessity, and with accordance to international law” and said Hamas “unlawfully embed their military assets in civilian areas”. Three of the refusers have spoken to the BBC. Two agreed to give their names, while a third requested anonymity because he feared repercussions. All stress that they love their country, but the experience of the war, the failure to reach a hostage deal led to a defining moral choice. One soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, was at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport when news started coming in about the Hamas attacks. He recalls feeling shock at first. Then a ringing sensation in his ears. “I remember the drive home… The radio’s on and people [are] calling in, saying: ‘My dad was just kidnapped, help me. No-one's helping me. ’ It was truly a living nightmare. ”This was the moment the IDF was made for, he felt. It wasn’t like making house raids in the occupied West Bank or chasing stone-throwing youths. “Probably for the first time I felt like I enlisted in true self-defence. ”But his view transformed as the war progressed. “I guess I no longer felt I could honestly say that this campaign was centered around securing the lives of Israelis. ” He says this was based on what he saw and heard among comrades. “I try to have empathy and say, ‘This is what happens to people who are torn apart by war…’ but it was hard to overlook how wide this discourse was. ”He recalls comrades boasting, even to their commanders, about beating “helpless Palestinians”. And he heard more chilling conversations. “People would pretty calmly talk about cases of abuse or even murder, as if it was a technicality, or with real serenity. That obviously shocked me. ”The soldier also says he witnessed prisoners being blindfolded and not allowed to move “for basically their entire stay… and given amounts of food that were shocking”. When his first tour of duty ended he vowed not to return. The IDF referred me to a statement from last May which said any abuse of detainees was strictly prohibited. It also said three meals a day were provided, “of quantity and variety approved by a qualified nutritionist”. It said handcuffing of detainees was only carried out “where the security risk requires it” and “every day an examination is carried out… to make sure that the handcuffs are not too tight”. The UN has said reports of alleged torture and sexual violence by Israeli guards were “grossly illegal and revolting” and enabled by “absolute impunity”. Michael Ofer-Ziv, 29, knew two people from his village who were killed on 7 October, among them Shani Louk whose body was paraded through Gaza on the back of a pickup truck in what became one of the most widely shared images of the war. “That was hell,” he says. Michael was already a committed left-winger who advocated political not military solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, like his comrades, he felt reporting for reserve duty was correct. “I knew that the military action was inevitable… and was justified in a way, but I was very worried about the shape it might take. ”His job was to work as an operations officer in a brigade war room, watching and directing action relayed back from drone cameras in Gaza. At times the physical reality of the war hit home. “We went to get some paper from somewhere in the main command of the Gaza area,” he remembers. “And at some point we opened the window… and the stench was like a butchery… Like in the market, where it's not very clean. ”Again it was a remark heard during a discussion among comrades that helped push him towards action. “I think the most horrible sentence that I heard was someone who said to me that the kids that we spared in the last war in Gaza [2014] became the terrorists of October 7, which I bet is true for some cases… but definitely not all of them. ” Such extreme views existed among a minority of soldiers, he says, but the majority were “just indifferent towards the price… what's called ‘collateral damage’, or Palestinian lives”. He’s also dismayed by statements that Jewish settlements should be built in Gaza after the war - a stated aim of far-right government ministers, and even some members of Netanyahu’s Likud party. Figures suggest there is a growing body of officers and troops within the IDF who come from what is called a ‘National Religious’ background: these are supporters of far-right Jewish nationalist parties who advocate settlement and annexation of Palestinian lands, and are firmly opposed to Palestinian statehood. According to research from the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, a non-governmental think tank, the number of such officers graduating from the military academy rose from 2.5% in 1990 to 40% in 2014. Ten years ago, one of Israel’s leading authorities on the issue, Professor Mordechai Kremnitzer, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, warned about what he called the ‘religification’ of the army. “Within this context, messages about Jewish superiority and demonisation of the enemy are fertile ground for fostering brutality and releasing soldiers from moral constraints. ”The decisive moment for Michael Ofer-Ziv came when the IDF shot three Israeli hostages in Gaza in December 2023. The three men approached the army stripped to the waist, and one held a stick with a white cloth. The IDF said a soldier had felt threatened and opened fire, killing two hostages. A third was wounded but then shot again and killed, when a soldier ignored his commander’s ceasefire order. “I remember thinking to what level of moral corruption have we got… that this can happen. And I also remember thinking, there is just no way this is the first time [innocent people were shot]… It's just the first time that we are hearing about it, because they are hostages. If the victims were Palestinians, we just would never hear about it. ”The IDF has said that refusal to serve by reservists is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and Prime Minister Netanyahu insists it is “the most moral army in the world”. For most Israelis, the IDF is the guarantor of their security; it helped found Israel in 1948 and is an expression of the nation - every Israeli citizen over 18 who is Jewish (and also Druze and Circassian minorities) must serve. The refusers have attracted some hostility. Some prominent politicians, like Miri Regev, a cabinet member and former IDF spokeswoman, have called for action. “Refusers should be arrested and prosecuted,"" she has said. But the government has so far avoided tough action because, according to Yuval Green, “the military realised that it only draws attention to our actions, so they try to let us go quietly. ” For those starting their national service and who refuse, sanctions are tougher. Eight conscientious objectors - not part of the reservists group - due to begin their military service at 18 years old have served time in military prison. The soldiers I spoke with described a mix of anger, disappointment, pain or ‘radio silence’ from their former comrades. “I strongly oppose them [the refusers],” says Major Sam Lipsky, 31, a reservist who fought in Gaza during the current war but is now based outside the Strip. He accuses the refusers group of being “highly political” and focused on opposing the current government. “I don't have to be a Netanyahu fan in order to not appreciate people using the military, an institution we're all meant to rally behind, as political leverage. ”Maj Lipsky is a supporter of what he views as Israel’s mainstream right - not the far right represented by government figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister who has been convicted of inciting racism and supporting terrorism, and finance minister, Belazel Smotrich, who recently called for the population of Gaza to be halved by encouraging “voluntary migration”. Maj Lipsky acknowledges the civilian suffering in Gaza and does not deny the imagery of dead and maimed women and children. As we speak at his home in southern Israel, his two young children are sleeping in the next room. “There's no way to fight the war and to prosecute a military campaign without these images happening,” he says. He then uses an expression heard in the past from Israeli leaders: “You can't mow the lawn without grass flying up. It is not possible. ”He says the blame belongs to Hamas who went to “randomly slaughter as many Jews as possible, women, children, soldiers”. The imperative of fighting the war has postponed a deepening struggle over the future character of the Jewish state. It is, in large part, a conflict between the secularist ideals held by people like Michael Ofer-Zif and Yuval Green, and the increasingly powerful religious right represented by the settlements movement, and their champions in Netanyahu’s cabinet, including figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Add to that the lingering, widespread anger over the government’s attempts to dilute the power of the country’s judiciary in 2023 - it led to mass demonstrations in the months before October 7 - and the stage is set for a turbulent politics long after the war ends. On both sides it is not unusual to hear people talk of a struggle for the soul of Israel. Maj Lipsky was packing to return to military duty on the evening I met him, sure of his duty and responsibility. No peace until Hamas was defeated. Among the refusers I spoke with, there was a determination to stand by their principles. Michael Ofer-Ziv may leave Israel, unsure whether he can be happy in the country. “It just looks less and less likely that I will be able to hold the values that I hold, wanting the future that I want for my kids to live here, and that is very scary,” he says. Yuval Green is training to become a doctor, and hopes that a settlement can be reached between peacemakers among the Israeli and Palestinian people. “I think in this conflict, there are only two sides, not the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. There is the side that supports violence and the side that supports, you know, finding better solutions. ” There are many Israelis who would disagree with that analysis, but it won’t stop his mission.

3366,2024-08-17 10:02:42.163000+00:00,/news/articles/c8jl0p4vklyo,"When 21-year-old Indiana University philosophy student Craig Sautter drove to Chicago for the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he had an ""inkling"" that he would be in for a ""wild day"". There had been a series of riots after the back-to-back assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy just months before, and he could tell that simmering tensions were ready to boil over when thousands of protesters, police, politicians and delegates gathered that August to pick who would be the next Democratic candidate for president. Yet the young anti-Vietnam War activist was still shocked by what he saw: National Guardsmen with bayonets, protesters ripped from cars or beaten with police batons, and thick clouds of tear gas wafting through crowds of thousands. ""We were mostly middle-class kids, or business people who were there in suits, protesting against the war,"" Mr Sautter recalled. ""We never thought that the police would attack an unarmed group of people who were just singing and shouting. . . we were in disbelief. ""Ultimately, more than 600 protesters were arrested and over 100 treated for injuries, alongside 119 police officers. Scenes of the violent clashes in the streets and parks of Chicago soon flashed on TV screens across the country, and the world, leaving an unforgettable image of America in chaos. ""People were chanting that the whole world was watching,"" added Mr Sautter, now a professor at Chicago's DePaul University who researches presidential conventions. The return of the DNC to Chicago in 2024 has led many to look back at 1968 and draw parallels. Like back then, there will be anti-war protests - this time against the Biden administration's support for Israel during the war in Gaza. And like back then, there has been a surprising change of guard amongst Democratic leadership. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election months before the convention, while this time, President Biden pulled out of the race with merely weeks to go. But experts and veterans of the 1960s protest movement believe the differences far outweigh the similarities. Nonetheless, some of those involved in planning the anti-Gaza war protests at the upcoming DNC say they draw inspiration from the activists who took to the streets of Chicago nearly 60 years ago. ""This is the Vietnam War of our era,"" Hatem Abudayyah, a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the DNC, told the BBC. ""The attacks on our movement, our students and our organisations are similar to the attacks on the movement that was trying to stop 1968. . . I absolutely see those parallels. ""The coalition includes over 200 organisations involved in the protests, and its spokespeople have said that ""tens of thousands"" of participants are expected. The size of the protests has prompted Chicago's police department to warn that it won't tolerate ""violent actors"" or incidents of vandalism or criminality. Mr Abudayyah says there has been ""no evidence of any violence"" during protests organised by the coalition or its member groups since the conflict in the Middle East began 10 months ago. Others have dismissed any real similarities to 1968. ""Other than the fact that they're in Chicago, there are none,"" long-time Democratic National Committee member and DNC delegate Elaine Kamarck told the BBC. ""This is not even close. "" One key difference, according to Ms Kamarck, is that the Chicago police employed ""very, very thuggish tactics"" 56 years ago. A federally-mandated commission later accused the force of a ""police riot"" at the DNC. Just months before, then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had also issued ""shoot to kill"" orders in the wake of riots after Martin Luther King's death. ""All hell was breaking loose,"" said Ms Kamarck, who was 18 at the time. ""There's no such thing going on now. "" Ms Kamarck's assessment was echoed by Marsha Barrett, a professor of US political history at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. ""Daley had very strong control over police, and an antagonistic relationship with protesters,"" she said. ""The city had set up a situation where there was likely to be a major conflict. "" ""We don't have that now,"" she added. Chicago police have been in regular touch with DNC protest groups and have vowed to protect their rights to free speech, provided that the protests remain lawful. ""The understanding of police activity at that time was that the would use whatever force was needed to overcome resistance,"" said Mr Sautter. ""Now the police are better trained,"" he added. ""They're not going to provoke anything unless some kind of violence breaks out. ""  Among those who witnessed the violence first-hand was Abe Peck, then editor of the Chicago Seed, an underground newspaper linked to the Youth International Movement, or Yippies, that planned events around the 1968 convention. ""We were in our office, which was in a dry cleaners', and all of a sudden our window fragmented,"" remembers Mr Peck, who was later credited with creating the ""whole world is watching"" chant. ""Two shots were fired through it. Fortunately nobody was hit. ""When they ran outside to investigate, Mr Peck saw only one vehicle: a Chicago police cruiser. The incident was one of several which marked his experiences of the DNC, which also included the police ""stomping out"" religious ministers tied to the counterculture movement. That violence, Mr Peck told the BBC, stands in stark contrast to today. Social media and the immediate spread of news could create a public relations disaster if police were seen to be too aggressive. ""Back then, there was a real delay in getting news out. Now, it's essentially instantaneous,"" Mr Peck said. ""That's a big difference. ""  Don Rose, who in 1968 was a spokesman for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War, one of the main protest groups, told the BBC that an even more significant difference was the Vietnam War itself. That war, unlike the Gaza war, saw tens of thousands of Americans drafted, many of whom were killed or wounded overseas. ""The country was far more divided on the Vietnam War at that time. The protests expanded greatly because of the draft,"" said Mr Rose, now 93. ""We were protesting at a convention that would nominate someone who could end the war with the stroke of a pen,"" he added. The Democratic Party at the time was also deeply divided over the war, and when delegates arrived at the DNC of 1968, they had no idea who would be leaving with the nomination.  When then-vice president Hubert Humphrey was finally chosen as nominee over anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy, some in the audience even shouted “No!”. ""The convention was totally divided, and at war with itself,"" explained Mr Sautter. ""For [Kamala] Harris and Walz, it's totally unified. ""Mr Peck, for his part, said that more recent versions of the DNC can no longer be called ""nominating conventions"". ""These are just confirmation conventions,"" he said. ""They confirm what the people in states did at the primary levels. That's really different. ""Ultimately, Hubert Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 election to Republican Richard Nixon. Looking back, Mr Sautter - who will be watching the convention on TV this year - believes that the protests of 1968 had an impact on the US that could never be replicated in 2024. ""People who watched were totally radicalised by it, and many, many more people became involved in trying to stop the war,"" he said. ""A whole generation, whether they were there or not, were marked by it.

3367,2024-08-20 12:59:45.768000+00:00,/news/articles/cdeyz89rwdro,"Just over a week ago, the Israeli deputy ambassador to the UK posted a photograph on social media that sparked fury within the SNP. Daniela Grudsky smiled as she posed with Scotland's external affairs secretary. She thanked Angus Robertson for ""welcoming us to wonderful Scotland"", adding that she was ""looking forward to cooperating in the fields of technology, culture and renewable energy"". This, to many both inside and outside the party, was an outrage. SNP politicians had spent months pushing their position on Gaza - pressing for an immediate ceasefire, an end of arms sales to Israel, and the recognition of the Palestinian state. They had urged others to ""find their moral compass"", and yet here was a senior member of the Scottish government discussing areas of ""mutual interest"" with a representative of the Israeli administration. Criticism has been widespread inside the party, and expressed both publicly and privately at all levels. From grassroots members, to MSPs, MPs, former - and even current - ministers. For some, the decision to take the meeting at all was wrong. Others accept - as Mr Robertson argues - that this was an opportunity to put the government's views directly to the Israelis. However, they were concerned about the scope of the discussions, and the notion there could be any cooperation between the two countries. Certainly there has been immense pressure on the Scottish government to explain itself. And its handling of the row has undoutedly prolonged it. For more than a week after the deputy ambassador's post, the criticism grew. The first minister had intervened, acknowledging the anger but doubling down on the decision to take the meeting. But questions remained over just how robust Mr Robertson had been in his condemnation of Israel's conduct. Comments from the SNP backbench MSP John Mason - who held his own meeting with the deputy ambassador  - that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza resulted in him being suspended from the party, and only served to heighten things. While the anger was certainly palpable, there was no sense in government that Mr Robertson's position was becoming untenable. It was clear however that he would need to speak out. And so came an apology for not limiting the talks to a call for an immediate ceasefire, with confirmation no further meetings would take place until the situation in Gaza changes. It was an attempt to get on the front foot ahead of the SNP's conference at the end of this month - to be contrite and to take the heat out of what was becoming an increasingly public backlash. So will it be enough?Mr Robertson says he has not considered quitting his ministerial post. And, given he has the backing of the first minister, it would seem unlikely he's going anywhere soon. Former First Minister Humza Yousaf, who was praised for his own handling of the Gaza issue, said Mr Robertson had ""clearly listened and reflected on the anger and upset"". Aside from the Scottish Greens, most of that anger has come from within his own party, so the external affairs secretary is unlikely to come under cross-party pressure when Holyrood returns in September. Labour doesn't have its own troubles to seek when it comes to Gaza, with Sir Keir Starmer facing protests during a recent visit to Scotland for his handling of the issue. To criticise the Scottish government would leave it open to accusations of hypocrisy. The Conservatives have also stayed out of the row. Indeed Scottish Tory leadership hopeful Russell Findlay said he would also have taken the meeting. It's not the first time Mr Robertson has faced criticism over his handling of his brief. A visit to China last year to promote business and tourism was called into question by one of the SNP's MPs, given the country's human rights record. Some argue that engaging with those who you don't agree with is part and parcel of diplomacy - all part of the external affairs secretary's job. However, sensitivities around the politics of the Middle East are such that some won't be satisfied with a pledge of no further meetings with the Israelis. And Mr Robertson might find the criticism from this particular incident difficult to shake off. The party conference could be another flashpoint, with one SNP branch reportedly planning to put pressure on him with a condemnatory motion. It's unclear whether it will reach the conference floor, but at a time when the SNP leadership wants to unite its party, it will be keen to move on from another issue that has caused further division.",Will sorry save Robertson after Israeli meeting?,Will sorry save Robertson after Israeli meeting?,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdeyz89rwdro,articles/article_3367.txt,results/article_3367.txt.json
3368,2024-10-11 11:12:15.822000+00:00,/news/articles/cwyl2x3ye8no,"Amid acrid smoke and cries from residents, rescue workers were searching Friday morning for signs of anyone left trapped in the rubble from two Israeli air strikes that hit central Beirut overnight. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, 22 people died and 117 were wounded, making these the deadliest strikes in central Beirut of the recent escalation. At the site of the heaviest of the two, in the Shia neighbourhood of Basta, the head of the Civil Defence rescue team Youssef Al-Mallah told the BBC that five people were still unaccounted for. The Civil Defence has appealed for family members of the missing to come forward with any information on their whereabouts, Al-Mallah said. Unconfirmed reports Friday said that Wafiq Safa, the head of Hezbollah’s liaison and coordination unit, was the target of one of the strikes but managed to survive. Israeli authorities have not commented. They issued no warnings ahead of the strikes, as they have in some instances. Both the strikes on Beirut hit residential buildings in densely packed neighbourhoods. The missile that hit Basta fell close to the site of an earlier strike that killed nine people last week. It destroyed a four-storey building completely and severely damaged or destroyed at least three adjacent buildings. The other strike, on the mostly Shia neighbourhood of Nweiri, hit the third floor of an eight-storey building, ejecting large pieces of rubble into the street and destroying cars and shopfronts below. The timing of the strikes - at about 20:00 local time, 18:00 BST - meant that many residents of the neighbourhoods were at home or on the street in the vicinity. Hassan Jaafar, a 22-year-old security guard, was at home with friends just 50m from the Basta strike. He told the BBC they heard a ""roar that seemed to grow closer with every second"". ""The shockwave knocked us off our feet, sending us backwards as dust and debris filled the air,"" he said. ""For a moment, everything vanished in a cloud of ash. ""Jaafar said he and his friends were bruised and cut in the strike by flying debris and glass. ""In that moment, it felt like the war had expanded into our lives,"" he said. On the massive pile of rubble left by the strike on Friday morning, distraught residents looked on at their destroyed apartments and pleaded with members of the Civil Defence team to help them retrieve surviving possessions. One group of women was searching for a missing relative - a mother of young children who was last seen on a stretcher at the site. The Civil Defence team told the group they needed to check at every hospital in person. “If she left here on a gurney she will be at a hospital somewhere,” a rescue worker said. Ibtisam Mazloum, 42, was in her building nearby when the strike hit. “If they want to fight they should fight at the border,” she said, angrily. “The civilians in Beirut are not part of this. ”At the site of the Nweiri strike, Musa Araf, who works for the Civil Defence, described being in his apartment on the sixth floor of the target building when the missile hit. “I didn’t panic because of my job, I am used to it,” he said. “But my children were screaming and clinging on to me. One of my grandchildren was cut by flying glass. ” This is the third time Israel has launched air strikes on Beirut outside of the city’s southern suburb of Dahieh, where the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah has a strong presence. The previous strikes on central Beirut targeted members of Hezbollah and the People’s Front for the Liberation of Palestine, according to the IDF. One hit a health clinic which the IDF described as Hezbollah-affiliated and killed nine people. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch called on Friday for an inquiry into Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. Reports said that an observation post belonging to the United Nations peacekeeping mission (Unifil) had been fired at by Israeli forces. The incident would mark the fourth time in recent days that Israeli troops have fired at Unifil bases. Yesterday, two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired at a watchtower at the force's headquarters in Ras al-Naqoura. Hezbollah said on Friday it had launched an attack on an Israeli military base in the northern city of Haifa using explosive-laden drones. The Iran-backed group said the attack was a retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut.",Witness describes 'roar then explosion' from Israeli strikes on Beirut that killed 22,Witness describes 'roar then explosion' from Israeli strikes on Beirut that killed 22,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyl2x3ye8no,articles/article_3368.txt,results/article_3368.txt.json
3369,2024-10-15 16:42:53.980000+00:00,/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo,"Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsettingWitnesses to an Israeli air strike and resulting fire at a tent camp in a Gaza hospital compound have shared with the BBC their horror and helplessness at seeing people injured and killed in the flames. One mother called it “one of the worst scenes we’ve witnessed”, while an injured girl said she heard screaming as people tore down their tent to get them out. A man said he had ""broken down"" as he was ""unable to do anything"" to help those who burned to death. The strike hit the al-Aqsa Hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, in the early hours of Monday, igniting a fire that burned makeshift shelters for displaced people. At least four people were killed and dozens injured, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The BBC has verified the location of a video that shows what appears to be a person on fire. Other footage captures people rushing to extinguish the flames amid screams and explosions sending fireballs into the night sky. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas fighters operating inside a command centre in the car park, after which a fire broke out ""likely due to secondary explosions"". The military said the incident was under review. Charity Doctors without Borders (MSF), which has staff working at al-Aqsa, told the BBC “it had no knowledge“ of a Hamas centre and said “the hospital functions as a hospital”. The UN's humanitarian affairs agency said in a statement that “people burned to death” and “atrocities must end”, while a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council called the footage “disturbing”. ""The images and video of what appear to be displaced civilians burning alive following an Israeli air strike are deeply disturbing and we have made our concerns clear to the Israeli government,” the spokesperson told the BBC’s partner CBS. “Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties — and what happened here is horrifying, even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields. ” Witnesses said the strike happened at about 01:15 local time on Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday). It hit an area between buildings filled with makeshift shelters, next to an outdoor outpatient waiting area that had no one there at night, Anna Halford, MSF's emergency coordinator in Gaza who was not at the hospital during the strike, said in a phone call from Deir al-Balah. Hiba Radi, a mother who was living in a tent behind the hospital, told a BBC freelancer in Gaza she woke up to the sound of “explosions and fires erupting around the tents”. “There were explosions everywhere, and we were shocked at whether this was gas or weapons,” she said. “This is one of the worst scenes we've witnessed and lived through,"" she added. ""We’ve never seen destruction like this before. It’s hard, really hard. ”Atia Darwish, a photographer who recorded some of the verified videos, told the BBC it was a “big shock” and he was “unable to do anything” watching people burn. “I was so broken down,” he said. Um Yaser Abdel Hamid Daher, who also lives at the hospital, told the BBC “we've seen so many people burning that we started feeling like we might burn like them”. The injured included her son, and his wife and children. Her granddaughter Lina, 11, who had shrapnel in her hand and leg injuries, said she had heard people screaming. ”Our neighbour’s daughter was injured in her head and her dad was killed. And our other neighbours were killed. The people next to us tore down the tent to get us out,” she said. Her grandmother said the family “lost their tent and everything they had; they have nothing left”. The health ministry reported on Monday that more than 40 people were injured and four killed. MSF on Tuesday shared a higher toll, saying five people had died, their bodies burned by the time they were recovered, and 65 injured. Forty of the injured - 22 men, eight women and 10 children - stayed at al-Aqsa. The others were transferred to different hospitals, with eight going to a specialist burns unit. Ms Halford said her colleagues were treating burns victims ”who will almost certainly not survive"", saying “there is very little you can do for burn victims of that severity”. “You come home with the smell of it on your clothes. It's a viscerally affecting experience. It stays with you,” she said. Monday’s strike was the seventh on the hospital site since March, and the third in two weeks, Ms Halford said. When she arrived at the hospital after the most recent hit, she said she found people picking through twisted metal and burned debris to salvage any belongings. Another mother the BBC spoke to whose children suffered burns injuries had already evacuated from north Gaza - and now has nothing. The acting chief of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the strike occurred in an area where north Gaza residents had been told to relocate. “There really is no safe place in Gaza for people to go,” the statement read.

3370,2024-08-28 17:38:57.687000+00:00,/news/articles/clywnxj4dd8o,"The UN food agency has said it is pausing the movement of its staff in the Gaza Strip ""until further notice"" after its team came under fire near an Israeli checkpoint. In a statement, the World Food Programme (WFP) said the incident happened at the Wadi Gaza bridge on Tuesday evening as two of its armoured vehicles were escorting a convoy of lorries with humanitarian aid. The WFP said that while nobody was injured, one vehicle was directly hit, despite the convoy being clearly marked and ""receiving multiple clearances by Israel"". The BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the issue. In Wednesday's statement, the WFP said: ""The team was returning from a mission to Kerem Shalom/Karam Abu Salem with two WFP armoured vehicles after escorting a convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian cargo routed to Gaza’s central area. It said one of the WFP vehicles was then ""directly struck by gunfire as it was moving towards"" an IDF checkpoint.  ""It sustained at least 10 bullets: five on the driver’s side, two on the passenger side and three on other parts of the vehicle. None of the employees on board were physically harmed. ""The WFP added that although this was not the first security incident during the war, it was the first time its vehicle had been directly shot at near a checkpoint, despite securing the necessary clearances. ""The incident is a stark reminder of the rapidly and ever shrinking humanitarian space in the Gaza Strip, where increasing violence compromises our ability to deliver life-saving assistance,"" the agency said. Executive director Cindy McCain described the incident as ""totally unacceptable"". ""I call on the Israeli authorities and all parties to the conflict to act immediately to ensure the safety and security of all aid workers in Gaza,"" she added. Earlier, the UN said its humanitarian aid operation in the Gaza Strip was continuing, after a senior official said it had ground to a halt on Monday due to Israeli military evacuation orders. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Tuesday evening that conditions “made it extremely, extremely difficult for us to do our work”, but that “we are doing what we can with what we have”. On Sunday, UN staff had to relocate quickly after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order covering a part of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone around the central town of Deir al-Balah, where the UN had its main operations centre. The military said it had acted to protect civilians while operating against Hamas “terror operatives” in the area. It also said that it was working with the UN and other international organisations to find alternative locations for them to continue their activities. Up to 88.5% of Gaza has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the UN, which is the primary provider and distributor of humanitarian aid in the territory. That has forced an estimated 1.8 million people to shelter inside the humanitarian zone, which currently spans only about 41 sq km (15.8 sq miles) and lacks critical infrastructure and basic services. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Tuesday evening, Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security Gilles Michaud said the IDF had given more than 200 UN personnel a few hours’ notice on Sunday to move out of their offices and living places in a southern area of Deir al-Balah. The UN’s humanitarian office said the order affected 15 UN and NGO premises, as well as four UN warehouses, a water desalination plant and al-Aqsa hospital, the town’s main medical facility. “The timing could hardly be worse, with the start of a massive polio vaccination campaign scheduled for next week, for which large numbers of staff will need to enter the strip,” Mr Michaud said. The UN is planning to vaccinate 640,000 children after a 10-month-old baby who contracted the water-borne disease was left partially paralysed - the first registered case in Gaza in 25 years. It has appealed to the warring parties to implement two seven-day humanitarian pauses in order to allow the vaccinations to be carried out successfully. The IDF said in a statement on Wednesday that it had been forced to issue evacuation orders in and around Deir al-Balah to carry out “essential operations” against Hamas “terror operatives” and their infrastructure. It also stressed that it was operating “in full co-ordination with the international community to preserve the activity of the international community’s vital centres, including shelters, aid depots and residences”. “However, in light of the cynical exploitation carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organisations, there is sometimes a need to evacuate these centres. ”The IDF said it would take action to help find alternative locations for UN agencies and NGOs to continue their activities and to provide alternative aid routes. Also in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday, local medics said at least eight Palestinians had been killed in an air strike near a school housing displaced people in the town. Another 11 people were reportedly killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli tanks were said to have advanced into the city centre.",World Food Programme halts Gaza staff movements,World Food Programme halts Gaza staff movements,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clywnxj4dd8o,articles/article_3370.txt,results/article_3370.txt.json

The chiefs of MI6 and the CIA also said both countries stand together in ""resisting an assertive Russia and Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine"". In a first-ever joint article, Sir Richard Moore and William Burns wrote in the Financial Times, external that they saw the war in Ukraine coming ""and were able to warn the international community"", in part by declassifying secrets to help Kyiv. And they said there was work being done to ""disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage"" across Europe by Russia, push for de-escalation in the Israel-Gaza war, and counterterrorism to thwart the resurgent Islamic State (IS). In the FT op-ed, they wrote: ""There is no question that the international world order – the balanced system that has led to relative peace and stability and delivered rising living standards, opportunities and prosperity – is under threat in a way we haven’t seen since the Cold War. """"Successfully combating this risk"" is at the foundation of the special relationship between the UK and US, they added. One of the ""unprecedented array of threats"" faced by both countries is the war in Ukraine, which is in its third year after Russia's invasion in February 2022. The security services chiefs made their first public speaking appearance together at the FT Weekend Festival at London's Kenwood House on Saturday. Details of the speakers were kept under wraps until just minutes before they arrived on stage. They appeared relaxed together and stressed the close working partnership between their agencies. Mr Burns told attendees that Ukraine's recent seizure of Russian territory in the Kursk region was a ""significant tactical victory"", but he saw no evidence that  Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power was weakening. There have been calls from Ukraine for the West to supply more weapons and lift restrictions on their use inside Russia.  The failure to do so has sometimes been put down to fears over how Moscow might react. But the spy chiefs suggested that should not deter support for Ukraine. ""None of us should take lightly the risks of escalation,"" Mr Burns said. He described a moment in late 2022 when there was, he said, a ""genuine risk"" of the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia in response to setbacks on the battlefield. Mr Burns passed messages to Russian officials warning of the consequences of their use. ""I’ve never thought, however - and this is the view of my agency - that we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that,"" the CIA Director continued. ""Putin’s a bully. He’s going to continue to sabre rattle from time to time. ""Asked about an apparent increased willingness of Russian intelligence services to carry out covert operations like sabotage and arson in Europe, Sir Richard Moore said their use of criminals to carry out attacks suggested a degree of desperation. ""Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral in some of their behaviour,"" he said. Mr Burns added that even if plots sometimes appeared amateurish, they could still be ""reckless and dangerous"". In their joint piece for the FT newspaper, both men said ""staying the course is more vital than ever"" when it comes to supporting Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin ""will not succeed"". The conflict has shown how technology can alter the course of war, and highlighted the need to ""adapt, experiment and innovate"", they said. They continued: ""Beyond Ukraine, we continue to work together to disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe being waged by Russian intelligence, and its cynical use of technology to spread lies and disinformation designed to drive wedges between us. ""Both foreign intelligence services see the rise of China as the main intelligence and geopolitical challenge of the century. They have reorganised their services ""to reflect that priority"", the pair wrote. They also said they have pushed ""hard"" for restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, and have been working ""ceaselessly"" to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. Mr Burns, who has been central to ceasefire efforts, indicated at the FT event that there may be a more detailed proposal in the coming days. ""This is ultimately a question of political will,"" he said, adding that he ""profoundly"" hopes leaders on both sides will do a deal. It is 11 months since Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then in Israel's ongoing military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",World order 'under threat not seen since Cold War',World order 'under threat not seen since Cold War',israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2gz4re394o,articles/article_3371.txt,results/article_3371.txt.json
3372,2024-10-17 19:16:04.958000+00:00,/news/articles/czj9zzgvjrno,"Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, has been killed by Israeli soldiers in southern Gaza, Israel has confirmed. Sinwar had led the armed group in Gaza since 2017 and was described by Israel, the US and UK as the mastermind behind the 7 October attacks - when Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, said the killing of the Hamas chief marked not the end but the ""beginning of the end"" of the year-long war in Gaza. The Israeli military said Sinwar was among three militants killed on Wednesday in Rafah in the south of the territory. It added that there were no signs of hostages at the site. It has previously been claimed that Sinwar would travel with Israeli hostages as a means of protection. Three gunmen were sighted by Israeli soldiers running from house to house, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said. Once fired upon, they split up and Sinwar entered a building alone. He was spotted sitting in a chair by a drone - which he threw a piece of wood at, Hagari added. Soldiers entered the building and found Sinwar with a vest, a gun and 40,000 shekels (£8,240), he said. Lt Col Hertzi Halevi, chief of the IDF, said: ""We said we would get to him and we did get to him. The world is now better off without him. ""Confirmation of his death was delayed by several hours, as Israel compared dental records and fingerprints. Israel will have had his genetic data on file from the decades he spent in an Israeli prison. Earlier, graphic images circulating online appeared to show a dead body resembling Sinwar lying in rubble with a severe head injury. The IDF said at the time it was possible he had been killed - but did not want to prematurely confirm the death of a man it had been pursuing for over a year. Netanyahu hailed the killing of Sinwar, saying: ""While this is not the end of the war in Gaza, it's the beginning of the end. ""He said the conflict could end ""tomorrow"" if Hamas lays down its arms and returns the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Earlier, addressing the families of the hostages, Netanyahu said Israel would ""continue with all our might until we bring every one of your loved ones home, as they are our loved ones too"". Netanyahu told Gazans that Sinwar ""destroyed your lives"". ""Hamas will no longer control Gaza,"" he said. ""This is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and it is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally free yourselves from its tyranny. ""Sinwar's killing comes after Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in the Iranian capital, Tehran, in July. Sinwar was subsequently named as Hamas's overall leader, assuming Haniyeh's role as well. Sinwar - who was widely known as Abu Ibrahim - was born in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in 1962. He was first arrested by Israel aged 19 for ""Islamic activities"". Aged 25, in the late 1980s, he founded the Hamas security service al-Majd, which punished those accused of so-called morality offences and those suspected of collaborating with Israel. In 1988, he was sentenced to four life terms in prison in Israel - but was among the 1,027 prisoners released in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas in Gaza for over five years, in 2011. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, said Sinwar's killing was a ""significant military and moral achievement"". Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, said Sinwar ""joins a long series of eliminations"". ""Sinwar died while beaten, persecuted and on the run - he didn’t die as a commander, but as someone who only cared for himself. ""This is a clear message to all of our enemies. ""Hamas has yet to comment on Sinwar's killing, and there is no indication of who will take his place. Iran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training. The country's mission to the UN posted on X that the killing of Sinwar would lead to the strengthening of ""the spirit of resistance"". ""He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forward his path toward the liberation of Palestine,"" the mission said. US President Joe Biden congratulated Netanyahu in a phone call with the Israeli leader, saying it was ""a good day for Israel, for the United States and for the world"". He added that the death of Sinwar proved ""once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice"". Former CIA director David Petraeus told BBC Radio 4 that Sinwar's death was ""bigger"" than Osama Bin Laden's in 2012 - ""both hugely symbolic. . . but also hugely operational"" as Sinwar was the overall leader of Hamas. Israel's stated aim for entering Gaza in the wake of the 7 October attack was to destroy Hamas. Sir John Sawers, who headed up the UK's foreign intelligence service MI6 from 2009 to 2014, said Netanyahu would now want to ""press home"" his advantage. He told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme: ""Netanyahu at the moment feels he has a real advantage over not just Hamas but Hezbollah and Iran itself is on the back foot. ""And I think his instinct will be to press home that advantage. ""Sir John said he suspected the Israeli PM would seek to achieve most of the country's military goals before the next US president is inaugurated in January. Britain's prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, said the UK would ""not mourn"" Sinwar's death and called for the release of all hostages held by Hamas and a goal of ""long-term, sustainable peace in the Middle East"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the death was an ""opportunity"" to bring the conflict in the Middle East to an end. However, Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, said that it opened a ""new phase"" in the war. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says nearly 42,500 have been killed so far and more than 99,000 injured in the conflict. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Israel says 101 hostages are thought to still be in Gaza. This includes 97 abducted on 7 October, and four taken years earlier, some of whom are believed to be dead. The families of the seven American hostages said in a joint statement that ""all parties must immediately seize this opportunity"" to bring them home ""before it is too late"". In his remarks, Netanyahu admitted that the war was ""difficult and it is costing us dearly"", but added: ""Today we made clear once again what happens to those who harm us.

3373,2024-10-03 16:39:42.379000+00:00,/news/articles/cpw5v077nyjo,"A Yazidi woman who was kidnapped aged 11 in Iraq by the Islamic State group and subsequently taken to Gaza has been rescued after more than a decade in captivity there, officials from Israel, the US and Iraq said. The Yazidis are a religious minority who mostly live in Iraq and Syria. In 2014 the Islamic State group overran the Yazidi community in Sinjar in northern Iraq, massacring thousands of men, and enslaving girls and women. The Israeli military said the now 21-year-old's captor in Gaza had been killed during the ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas, probably as a result of an air strike. The woman, identified as Fawzia Amin Sido, then fled to another place in Gaza.  The Israeli military said Ms Sido was eventually freed during a ""complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors"" and taken to Iraq via Israel and Jordan. Iraqi foreign ministry official Silwan Sinjaree told Reuters that several earlier attempts to rescue her over the course of about four months failed because of the security situation in Gaza. Mr Sinjaree said Ms Sido was in good physical condition, but had been traumatised by her time in captivity and by the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Video shared by Canadian philanthropist Steve Maman showed Ms Sido reuniting with her family in Iraq. Posting on X, Mr Maman said: ""I made a promise to Fawzia the Yazidi who was hostage of Hamas in Gaza that I would bring her back home to her mother in Sinjar. ""To her it seemed surreal and impossible but not to me, my only enemy was time.  Our team reunited her moments ago with her mother and family in Sinjar. "" The Islamic State group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. In August 2014, IS militants swept through Iraq's north-western Sinjar region, which is the homeland of the Yazidi religious minority. In numerous Yazidi villages, the population was rounded up. Men and boys over the age of 14 were separated from women and girls. The men were then led away and shot, while the women were abducted as the ""spoils of war"". Some of the Yazidi girls and women who later escaped from captivity described being openly sold or handed over into sexual slavery as ""gifts"" to IS members. The Islamic State group is believed to have killed more than 3,000 Yazidis and captured 6,000 others in total. The UN said IS committed genocide as well as multiple crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Yazidis. Iraqi authorities say more than 3,500 members of the community have been rescued or freed and about 2,600 people remain missing.",Yazidi woman rescued from Gaza after decade in captivity,Yazidi woman rescued from Gaza after decade in captivity,gaza,http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpw5v077nyjo,articles/article_3373.txt,results/article_3373.txt.json

Israel has been bombing the area through the day, with more than 30 air strikes in just an hour. Forty-six people are confirmed dead - and that toll is expected to rise. Others are in critical condition in hospital, after Israeli attacks earlier this week. Noor Mossawi is among them. The six-year-old is lying unconscious in a paediatric intensive care unit, in Rayak Hospital, with bandages wrapped around her fractured skull. Her mother Rima is sitting by her bedside, holding a copy of the Quran and praying. She tells us her daughter is very bright and very sociable. ""She creates such a fun atmosphere at home. The house feels empty when she's not around. She loves meeting new people. ""All that changed last Monday, with an Israeli strike. She shows us another video of her daughter - this time praying, shortly before the attack. ""I was soothing her, telling her not to be afraid, that nothing would happen. She was calling on God and the prophets for help,"" Rima says. As the bombing was getting closer, Rima was hunkering by her front door with Noor and her twin brother Mohammed.  ""We weren’t brave enough to go inside,"" she says, ""because we thought the building would collapse on us if it was hit.  ""When it got more intense, I picked up Noor and her brother and was about to take them in, but the missile was much faster than I was. ""That missile left Mohammed lightly wounded, and Noor fighting for her life. As we speak, suddenly there is danger overhead. We hear a plane, and then an explosion which rattles the windows and knocks out the power for a few seconds. It’s another air strike. Rima barely reacts. Noor’s father Abdallah comes to visit, and is burning with rage. ""Please film my child,"" he says. ""She doesn't know what weapons are. She doesn't know how to fight. She was playing at home when the bombing started. They [Israel] wanted to terrorise the people and get them to flee.

Abdallah begs to differ. ""We have nothing to do with weapons. I am not involved with the resistance [Hezbollah]. But now I wish I was so that I could protect my children,"" he tells us. Minutes later, a few floors down, sirens wail as an ambulance brings in wounded from the latest strike. Medical staff are rushing back and forward.  The emergency department fills with tension. There are angry shouts, and shocked friends and relatives. We are asked to stop filming. The hospital has admitted 400 casualties of Israeli strikes since Monday - all civilians - according to Dr Basil Abdallah, the medical director. Of those, more than 100 have died, and several families had lost more than one person. Dr Abdallah tells us there is trauma among the staff, as well as the patients. ""Seeing children bombed, seeing elderly patients and women bombed, it's difficult,"" he says. ""Most of the nurses and the doctors are depressed. We have emotions. We are human. ""Most of the staff remain at the hospital around the clock as it is too dangerous to risk the journey home. Israel is striking far and wide in Lebanon. There’s no-one to stop it.

3376,2024-10-20 23:14:54.889000+00:00,/news/articles/cz7jx575pg7o,"The air strike that killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah shook the earth for hundreds of metres in every direction. A few blocks away, in the Beirut suburb known as the Dahieh, Mehdi Moussawi thought his own building was falling down. From his balcony, the 45-year-old taxi driver and his wife Zahraa – who asked that their names be changed for this story – watched as a thick blanket of smoke and dust enveloped everything around them. In the distance, they could hear debris raining down, and overhead the familiar buzz of an Israeli drone. The drones had become so common over Dahieh in the previous few days that they barely noticed them anymore. A majority Shia suburb in the south of Beirut, Dahieh was once again under Israel’s watchful eye; its more than half a million residents again under threat of death from above. “The missiles come down from the sky,” Mehdi said, gesturing the arc of a projectile falling to earth, “and suddenly everything you have is gone. ”He was sitting on a dirty, sun-baked patch of pavement on the edge of Martyrs’ Square in central Beirut – now home for the couple and their teenage boys. Around them were hundreds of others in similar circumstances, many from Dahieh. The suburb has borne the brunt of the recent Israeli bombing of Beirut, prompting a mass exodus of virtually its entire population. Dahieh is largely under the control of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed political and paramilitary group that is a powerful force across Lebanon. Hezbollah refused requests from the BBC for permission to enter the suburb for this story, to see the bomb damage, but a BBC analysis of video footage, Israeli evacuation warnings and recent satellite imagery shows at least 65 air strikes which have severely damaged or completely destroyed buildings. Some of those strikes have comprised dozens of individual bombs, and many have levelled not only the apparent target building but destroyed or severely damaged several adjacent buildings too. This was the fate of Mehdi and Zahraa’s apartment – to be next door to an Israeli strike. Zahraa wept when she saw footage of their blackened and mangled building. “Look at us,” she pleaded. “Our home is gone. We have no hygiene, we cannot wash. We have nothing. ” Dahieh is often described as a Hezbollah stronghold. The term does not reflect the totality of the suburb – a densely packed residential area where other political parties operate and where not everyone supports Hezbollah – but the group is certainly the strongest force there. Above ground, it is woven through the suburb’s social and political fabric, and provides services like welfare and education. Below, it has bunkers and tunnels from which it can operate. The IDF has targeted Dahieh in order to assassinate Hezbollah leaders, and says the group uses its bunkers to store weapons among the civilian population. It says it is targeting Hezbollah in order to safely return 60,000 of its own citizens to the north of Israel, which has come under rocket fire from Lebanon over the past year.  Unlike other parts of Beirut, Dahieh doesn’t have its own name, as such – the word simply means ‘suburb’. It is one of the most densely populated residential areas in all of Lebanon – a place of narrow streets and alleyways, where buildings seem to jostle for available space. It was heavily bombed in the previous war, back in 2006, and still bears scars from it. “Dahieh was originally a very beautiful place but all the wars have taken their toll,” said Rasha al-Ameer, a novelist and publisher who was born and raised in the suburb and still lives there. Her brother, a prominent critic of Hezbollah, was assassinated in Lebanon in 2021. “It is still a very vivid place and a diverse place. We have a cultural institution there and a lot of political activity,” she said. “It would be a terrible thing if Dahieh was destroyed. Though the bombing has destroyed much already. ”As well as homes, the Israeli air strikes have destroyed or damaged shops, businesses, restaurants and clinics. “Destruction on destruction,” said Mohaned Khalaf, a 45-year-old Sunni Muslim bakery worker, of his street in Burj El Brajneh, the most heavily targeted part of the suburb. Khalaf, already a refugee once, from Syria, has gone back into Dahieh periodically to check on the apartment he shares with his two brothers and their mother, to see if his furniture remains. “The buildings around ours have been destroyed,” he said. “There is no life left there, not a person to be seen. ”The destruction has tested some Dahieh residents’ patience with Hezbollah – particularly Sunnis and other non-Shias. “This war is hurting everyone,” said Khalaf’s mother, Sameera, who wept on the street. “I am 63 years old,” she said. “I just want a place where I can wash. ”Sameera does not want to return to Dahieh, even after the war. “Yes, we could go back and rebuild, but Hezbollah and Israel will fight this war over and over again,” she said. “And Dahieh will suffer again. ”Shia Muslims, Hezbollah’s more natural support base, took a more supportive view – even those whose lives had been completely upended by the conflict. Members of Hezbollah had handed out food and $100 bills to displaced Shia families on the streets in central Beirut, several families said, and helped assist with shelter places. “We used to support Hezbollah and we still support Hezbollah,” said Gharib Ali, a 61-year-old janitor who fled the suburb. Around him, his family nodded in agreement. The effect of the war on their lives “changes nothing for the Shia community,” he said. “If anything, it only increases our support. Every Shia feels the same. ” In this way, Mehdi and Zahraa may be something of an outlier – a Lebanese Shia couple, residents of Dahieh for decades, who were critical of Hezbollah for its role in the conflict. “Dahieh is not Hezbollah, we are not Hezbollah, our building was not Hezbollah,” Zahraa said, angrily. “We went to sleep one night and woke up in someone else’s war. ”The family’s apartment is now uninhabitable, though the building may be salvageable. The Israeli army has sometimes issued social media warnings ahead of its air strikes, but there was no warning for the strike that hit Mehdi and Zahraa’s building. Their eldest son had gone home that day to shower, taking advantage of a seemingly quiet moment, and was knocked over and cut by flying glass when the bomb hit. International humanitarian law generally requires an effective advance warning ahead of a strike that might affect civilians. But the BBC has found evidence of repeated Israeli strikes against Dahieh and other parts of Beirut where no warning was issued. And where there were warnings, some have been sent as little as 30 minutes beforehand, sometimes in the middle of the night. “That timeframe is not an effective advance warning for someone who lives in Dahieh,” said Ramzi Keiss, a Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These are people are sleeping, they’re in their beds. They are not looking at social media. ""Hezbollah was also possibly violating international humanitarian law, Keiss said, by placing its military commanders in and around the civilian population. “But that doesn’t give you a free pass to bomb as heavily as you can,” he added, referring to Israel. “When you’re using 2000lbs in densely populated areas, you’re going to put civilians at the risk of great harm. ”Lebanese officials estimate that more than 2,400 people have been killed in the country over the past year and more than 1.2 million been displaced. Israel says 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the same period. Back in the 2006 war, after Israel had pounded Dahieh and heavily bombed Lebanon’s civilian infrastructure, a senior IDF officer, Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, sketched out what would become known as the “Dahieh doctrine”. It called for applying “disproportionate force” against civilian areas, with the goal of pressuring the people of Lebanon to turn on Hezbollah. The recent escalation by Israel had gone “beyond Dahieh doctrine”, said Prof Amal Saad, an expert on Hezbollah and lecturer in politics at Cardiff University. “This is more like Gaza doctrine, which is similar, but has the goal of specifically targeting and displacing a community. ” In Dahieh, Israel’s actions were currently “somewhere between its Dahieh and Gaza doctrines”, she said. The destruction would not bring about, as the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly expressed hope for, a reduction in support for Hezbollah in places like Dahieh, Prof Saad said. “Whenever Israel invades like this, it only increases support for Hezbollah among Shias,” she said. “After 2006, support skyrocketed. I don’t know much higher it can go now than 90%, but this will solidify it. ” Two weeks after the bombing of Dahieh began, the air strikes ceased unexpectedly, following pressure from the US government, which said it had made it clear to Israel it was unhappy with the “scope and nature” of the targeting of Beirut. One day passed without any strikes, then another, then another. After three days, residents began returning on Monday and Tuesday to check on their apartments and retrieve possessions. Among them was Mehdi, who took his eldest son’s scooter and headed back into the devastated area around their building to grab clothes for the boys. Then, early on Wednesday morning, Israel began bombing Dahieh again. “We knew it was only a matter of time,” said Mehdi. He was sitting with Zahraa and the boys, a few hours after the strikes resumed, on the street by their makeshift tent, which was really just two rugs thrown over an improvised frame. Towering over them was an upscale, new, and completely empty apartment building. It bore a similar name to their apartment building, Zahraa said. “But for the cost of one of these apartments you could buy an entire neighbourhood in Dahieh,” she said. They would go back and rebuild, she said. She raised her arms in a mock bicep curl, to demonstrate the strength of the people from the Dahieh. “We have no choice,” Mehdi said. “Some people have choices, we don’t. ”They would return the moment the ceasefire was announced, he said. He knew that there would be no electicity, no water, and no windows in the buildings. But it was still better than being on the street. Overhead, an Israeli drone was buzzing. Mehdi looked up at the empty apartments across the street, and down at the tent they were sleeping under. “God willing, the ceasefire will come before the rain,” he said.
